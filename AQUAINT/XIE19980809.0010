He expressed hope the "sinister terrorism" will be uprooted with an all-out campaign through international cooperation.

More than 100 people have been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded in the blasts next to the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday. No one has claimed responsibility.
