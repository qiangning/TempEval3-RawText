Suspected bombs exploded outside the U.S. embassies in the Kenyan and Tanzanian capitals Friday, killing dozens of people, witnesses said.

The American ambassador to Kenya was among hundreds injured, a local TV said.

``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in Tanzania at the same time,'' he said.
