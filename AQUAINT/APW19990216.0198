Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has invited the foreign ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to a ceremony in Independence, Mo., on March 12 to mark the accession of the three countries into the NATO alliance.

The ceremony will take place at the Truman Presidential Library.

The venue was chosen to honor the announcement by President Truman of the creation of NATO 50 years ago, the State Department said.
