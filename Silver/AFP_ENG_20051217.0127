Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended Saturday author Orhan Pamuk's right to free speech, but rejected European Union pressure on Ankara to halt the controversial trial of the internationally renowned novelist.

"My stance on freedom of thought is clear because I myself have become a victim (of restrictions) in this context," Erdogan was quoted as saying by Anatolia news agency in the central city of Konya.

He said, however, that the EU, which sees Pamuk's trial as a test for Turkey's commitment to democracy and human rights, "is trying to put our judiciary under pressure," Anatolia reported.

"This is wrong," Erdogan said. "Either right or wrong, the case is now before the justice... Let's see the outcome and then make comments."

Pamuk, Turkey's best-known writer and winner of many international awards, appeared before court in Istanbul Friday on charges of denigrating Turkish national identity for telling a Swiss magazine that "one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it."

The case was adjourned to February to await a decision by the justice ministry, whose authorization is needed to proceed with the trial.

European Parliament members, who attended the hearing, criticized the government for having squandered the opportunity to demonstrate its respect for freedom of speech by failing to halt the trial.

Turkey began membership talks on October 4, but critics say the country has yet to fully embrace the EU's democarcy norms despite the far-reaching reforms it has already undertaken.

Erdogan has defended freedom of speech citing his own conviction for "inciting religious hatred" by reciting a poem with Islamic messages during a political rally in 1997, which earned him a four-month stint in prison.

Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul called on the EU not to judge Turkey's record by a single case.

"Let's not be unfair towards Turkey," he told the Sabah daily. "There is no conviction (in the Pamuk case) yet. There is no one in jail in Turkey because of (exercising) freedom of expression."

Gul pledged more efforts to ensure that the reforms Turkey undertook to boost its EU bid are properly implemented on the ground.

"It's our duty to strengthen the reform process," he said. "The changes adopted so far are not cosmetic, but there is still more to be done."

Erdogan said he had also asked the interior minister to investigate the apparent security lapses at Friday's trial, which was marred by nationalist militants heaping abuse on the writer and foreign observers.

Slogans accusing Pamuk of being a "traitor" followed him to the courtroom, and along the way a woman hit him on the head with a file. His car was pelted with eggs as he left.

British parliamentarian Denis MacShane, a former Europe minister, said he had been punched in the face by a hostile lawyer inside the courthouse.

Erdogan denounced the scenes as "ugliness" and said the police had committed "a serious mistake" by allowing such incidents.

The Turkish press accused the authorities of damaging Turkey's image by failing both to stop the trial and to ensure security at the hearing.

"Orhan Pamuk's trial and the scenes at the courthouse leave me with the impression that some people within the state favour such incidents in order to undermine (Turkey's) EU membership bid," a Sabah columnist wrote.
