Six members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt were charged on Monday with money laundering and remanded for two weeks days, a security source said.

It was the first time such a charge has been levelled against members of the Brotherhood, which is officially banned but tolerated. The six were arrested in various areas of Cairo on Sunday.

The same source also said that 107 students who were among 140 Brotherhood members arrested on December 14 after a demonstration at Al-Azhar university had their detention orders extended by 15 days.

Despite being officially banned, Muslim Brotherhood MPs form the largest opposition bloc in parliament after winning 88 of the 454 seats by running as independents in 2005 legislative elections.
