Australian consumer confidence experienced a surprising fall in December, despite significantly lower petrol prices, according to a survey released Wednesday.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index found that consumer sentiment dropped 2.7 percent in December to 104.7 points from the previous month.

"The index surprisingly fell by 2.7 percent -- I say surprisingly because last month it rose by nine percent and that was following a six percent fall in petrol prices," Westpac Banking Corp's global head of economics Bill Evans said.

"Since the last survey we've seen another 5.5 percent fall (in petrol prices) and yet the index actually fell," he told ABC radio.

The index has now settled at a point about six percent below the average level before higher global oil prices pushed up the price of petrol.

Evans said it appeared that petrol prices were no longer as important in defining consumer sentiment and it was more likely that the fear of interest rate rises was weighing on consumers' minds.

The Reserve Bank of Australia last lifted its key official cash rate 25 basis points to 5.50 percent in March.

Falling house prices in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in the September quarter as well as reforms to labour laws could also be contributing to the negative sentiment, Evans said.
