The Erez crossing on the Gaza- Israel border was partly closed Friday morning due to a possible terror threat, Israeli daily newspaper Ha'aretz reported.

The border crossing, which was the main exit for people in Gaza, was totally closed before dawn Friday, but was partly reopened in the morning time, said the report.

Earlier, the Israel Radio reported that intelligence information indicates that a terror organization was planning to carry out an attack at the Erez terminal.

Humanitarian cases and VIPs will be allowed to cross the border Friday, the radio said.

Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice extended her stay in the Middle East to broker a Gaza border deal.

The Rafah border crossing is slated to open on Nov. 25, when European inspectors are set to arrive to monitor compliance with the border agreements.
