Striking Palestinian justice ministry employees, including 140 judges, will return to work after reaching a deal with the Palestinian Authority Saturday, the head of the Palestinian judges' council said.

About 530 courthouse aides and 140 judges will return to work Sunday in exchange for half a month's salary, Eissa Abu Sharar told a press conference in the West Bank town of Ramallah.

The justice ministry staff are the third group of key public sector employees to call off industrial action that has paralyzed Palestinian government in the West Bank since September.

Some 12,000 hospital employees, including doctors, nurses and administrators, will also return to work Sunday after the government agreed last Monday to pay them two months salary.

Palestinian teachers called off their strike last month. The employees of at least 20 other government ministries remain on strike.

Sharar said that an estimated 48,000 court cases were postponed as a result of the strike.

The European Union and the United States imposed a crippling aid freeze on the Islamist-led government when it took power in March after an upset parliamentary election victory, leaving it unable to pay its own staff.

The Palestinian leadership is now meeting in Ramallah to decide on its next move after declaring an end to talks with Hamas on forming a government of national unity acceptable to Western donors.
