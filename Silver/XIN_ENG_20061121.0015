The World Trade Organization(WTO) has called for a trade policy review by the East African Community (EAC), according to local press reports on Tuesday.

English broadsheet The Guardian quoted a WTO Secretariat's trade policy review released earlier this month as urging Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to improve their multilateral commitments on both goods and services so as to increase their attractiveness to investment and business.

The WTO review expressed concerns to the multiple and sometimes overlapping regional trade arrangements of the three EAC member countries.

Apart from their own Customs Union, Kenya and Uganda are also members of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern African ( COMESA) while Tanzania is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and is also a signatory to the Agreement on the Global System of Trade Preferences Among Developing Countries (GSTP).

COMESA is a preferential trading bloc that was formed in December 1994 to replace the Preferential Trade Area that had existed since 1981. Tanzania quit COMESA in 2000.

SADC, yet to become a full-fledged customs union, is a regional economic integration union that was formed in April 1980 when it was known as the Southern African Development Coordination Conference.

The WTO review noted that though the EAC member states are free to negotiate bilateral trade arrangement, their overlapping arrangements have caused problems in such aspects as difficulties in identifying origins of products for taxability, in that COMESA and SADC are governed by different protocols.

The East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) is scheduled to debate in early December multiple membership with regional trading blocs so as to solve an eligibility dispute.

The EALA, the legislative arm of the East African Community, will start trading bloc membership debate on Dec. 5 when the East African parliament for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda meets in Arusha.
