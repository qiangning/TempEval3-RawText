A Pakistani military chief arrived here Wednesday for talks on military cooperation with Egypt.

Farooq Feroze Khan, chairman of Pakistan's joint chiefs of staff committee, went straight into talks with President Hosni Mubarak and said he invited him to visit Pakistan.

Khan also told reporters he would meet later with his Egyptian counterpart Magdi Hatata to discuss military cooperation between the two countries.

Egypt and Pakistan already cooperate in the fight against terrorism and signed an extradition treaty in 1995.

Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi said Tuesday that Cairo is seeking the extradition of an Islamic militant arrested recently in Pakistan.

Last week, sources close to security agencies in the Pakistani city of Peshawar said they had arrested an Egyptian and six other foreigners suspected of having links to Islamic extremists.
