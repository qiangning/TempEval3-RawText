The latest in a series of mass kidnappings spread terror in Baghdad on Sunday as peace talks between Iraq's bitterly divided factions produced a limited agenda for constitutional reform.

The violence in the war-torn capital also provided a grim backdrop to an unannounced visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who flew in to offer support to his beleaguered Iraqi counterpart Nuri al-Maliki.

At least 25 aid workers were hauled off at gunpoint from a Baghdad office of the Iraqi Red Crescent aid agency by a gang of 50 gunmen sporting police uniforms -- the second such mass abduction in Baghdad in three days.

The hostage-takers, jumping out of around 10 pick-up trucks, raided the Red Crescent building in the Karrada district in broad daylight, snatching at least two dozen men but leaving women behind, witnesses and officials said.

Nada Doumani, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), part of the same movement as the Red Crescent, said 25 aid workers and an unknown number of visitors were taken.

"We condemn such an attack against civilians and humanitarian workers. It is a breach of international humanitarian law. The building was clearly marked with the Red Crescent symbol," she said.

Meanwhile, a short distance away another gang -- again in the uniforms of the Shiite-dominated security forces -- shot dead one Sunni local councillor and kidnapped three more from their car, a security official said.

The latest abductions came three days after gunmen wearing military uniforms snatched dozens of businessmen from a commercial street in Baghdad, before releasing around 29 of their captives, all Shiites.

Less than a kilometre from the site of the kidnapping, protected behind the high walls of the fortified Green Zone, Blair stood shoulder to shoulder with Maliki and gave strong backing to his efforts to reunite the country.

He told the Iraqi leader that Britain will "stand four square behind you and the Iraqi people in ensuring that your democracy is not destroyed by terrorism, by sectarianism, by those who wish to live in hatred rather than peace".

British public support for the war has slipped amid mounting sectarian violence and military casualties, but Blair angrily dismissed the idea that the 2003 US and British invasion of Iraq had triggered the chaos.

Instead, he blamed "the same forces worldwide that are trying to prevent moderation, prevent modernisation, and prevent people expressing their will for democracy, through violence".

Blair flew from Baghdad to the southern port city of Basra where Britain has more than 7,000 soldiers fighting militias and training Iraqi forces. He met soldiers before flying on to the next leg in a Middle East tour.

The visit, planned in secret to protect him from attack, came as the Iraqi government held fresh peace talks to fend off civil war.

The national reconciliation conference began Saturday and marked the first attempt by the coalition government to draw former members of ousted leader Saddam Hussein's armed forces and Baath party into the political process.

But only a small number of representatives from movements outside the political process turned up, and the proposals which working groups suggested will have to be ratified by the cabinet or parliament.

"The only important practical measure recommended by the conference is paying sizeable pensions to former soldiers," Naseer al-Ani told AFP.

"Other than that, participants reiterated slogans about national unity and expressed good intentions for reforms that will have to be approved (by government and parliament)," said Ani.

The four committees that compiled the string of recommendations, after two days of talks that Maliki hoped would isolate insurgents, will now work on implementing their suggestions with government and parliament.

One recommendation would see Iraq reinstate compulsory military service, another suggests independent deputy ministers to be appointed alongside political appointees, and a third wants the Iraqi constitution reviewed.

On Saturday, Maliki called on Saddam-era army officers to join his armed forces to fight the insurgency and urged parliament to review a law banning former Baathists from administrative posts.

Iraq is in the grip of a dirty war between rival Sunni and Shiite factions battling for turf and political power in the chaos that has descended on the country as the government and US military battle Sunni insurgents.

Besides the kidnappings, Iraq endured a fresh round of shootings on Sunday that left three security officials dead and at least 21 bodies dumped in Baghdad, Baquba and the northern oil capital of Kirkuk, officials said.
