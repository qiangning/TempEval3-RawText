The Sudanese government on Tuesday brushed aside a U.S. warning on its Darfur issues by saying that they did not know the plan referred in the warning.

Ali al-Sadig, the spokesman of the Sudanese Foreign Ministry, told reporters that his government knew neither Plan A nor Plan B, which were talked about by Andrew Natsios, the U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan.

On Monday, Natsios warned that the United States and other countries would resort to what he called "Plan B" if Khartoum refused to change its position on the peacekeeping issue in Darfur by Jan. 1.

"On Jan. 1, either we see change or we go to Plan B," Natsios told reporters at the State Department, without elaborating the details.

Describing Natsios' statement as "inappropriate and not helpful for resolving the problem in Darfur," the spokesman said that "The U.S. envoy ignored the fact that agreements had been reached at the joint meeting of the UN, the AU, the Arab League and the Sudanese government in Addis Ababa on Thursday on most of the questions it discussed."

He reiterated that the Sudanese government would only accept a UN presence within the AU Mission in Darfur in the form of experts and technicians as well as the technical assistance that the AU force needs.
