Italian lower house on Sunday approved the government's planned 2007 budget, which included heavily protested tax increases and spending cuts.

The budget, which suggested 15 billion euros of spending cuts, passed by 311 votes to 251, one day after the government won a confidence vote on a series of measures tied to the budget, which must be approved by the Senate before the end of the year.

Italian Premier Romano Prodi, who narrowly beat former premier Silvio Berlusconi in April's general election, has been struggling to gain support among some of its allies for the budget, which is aimed at promoting growth and bringing the Italian deficit to within 3 percent of GDP by next year to meet Rome's EU commitments.
