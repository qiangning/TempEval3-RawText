Exports of French Polynesian black pearls rose 46 percent in 1996 against the previous to become the jewel of the French territory's economy, officials said Friday.

The 750 million francs (135 million dollars) earned from the pearls made up 90 percent of the value of French Polynesia's exports, according to the territorial economy minister, Georges Puchon.

He added that a tripling of the pearl industry exports in the next 10 years could bring the trade account into surplus. The territory currently exports about 850 million francs worth of goods but imports around five billion francs of goods.

Japan takes around two thirds of the pearls, with the United States, Hong Kong and Singapore the other main markets.

Some 87,000 black pearls from the Tuamotu and Gambier islands were to be put on show in Papeete on Friday and Saturday before being auctioned. Around 145 lots will be offered to around 50 foreign wholesalers and jewelers and 30 local buyers.

Producers hope to make 35 million francs from the auction, against 17 million francs last year.
