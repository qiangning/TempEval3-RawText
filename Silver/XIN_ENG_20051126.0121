Iranian anti-drug police have seized some 2.8 tons of illicit drugs in the southeastern city of Zahedan during the past three days, the official IRNA news agency reported on Saturday.

The massive haul, including 2,000 kg of opium, 400 kg of hashish, 400 kg of heroin and some narcotics, were seized when police searched suspected vehicles in the city during a drug- busting operation, a police officer was quoted by the IRNA as saying.

Over 100 weapons were also confiscated during the operation and 39 drug traffickers arrested, the officer added.

Zahedan is the capital city of the Sistan-Baluchestan province, which shares a 1,100-km border with Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Drug addiction and transportation has been a serious social problem in Iran, a country sitting in the crossroad linking drug producing Afghanistan and Pakistan and markets in the Persian Gulf states, central Asia, western Europe and other regions.

According to official statistics, there are at least 2 million drug addicts in Iran.

The country also accounts for 80 percent of the opium and 90 percent of the morphine intercepted worldwide, according to the International Narcotics Control Board.

The Islamic Republic spends 5 billion US dollars annually on anti-drug programs, and over 3,100 police have lost their lives in clashes with drug smugglers during the past two decades.
