A centre-left Indian coalition, toppled a week ago, vowed Friday to return to power by Monday after making up with an estranged ally.

The United Front coalition said it hoped to give a new government to the country after electing a successor to caretaker Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda late Friday or early Saturday.

"The formation of a new government is entirely likely before parliament resumes its session" on Monday, Front spokesman Jaipal Reddy told reporters at the coalition headquarters here.

There was no immediate reaction from the office of Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who Thursday urged the country's major parties to end the dragging political crisis by April 21.

The decks for a new Front leader were cleared Friday after the Congress (I) party, which voted out the coalition government April 11, formally pledged support to the same alliance minus Deve Gowda, who promptly agreed to the new arrangement.

The Congress made the promise to the president as the 13-party United Front intensified its search for a new head to become the country's next -- and 12th -- prime minister.

Congress chief Sitaram Kesri said in a letter to President Sharma that his party "resolved to extend support to the formation of a government by a new leader of the United Front."

The Congress action removed the last hitch in its attempt to again tie up with the Front and signalled the end of a political paralysis which gripped India at the end of last month.

Reddy said the new United Front government would have better relations with the Congress to avoid another divorce but ruled out the possibility of a coalition with the Congress.

"The question of coalition never arose and does not arise," he said.

The Front's previous minority government fell after the Congress alleged it was not consulted on major decisions.

The Congress began the crisis, ending 10 months of support to the Front coalition on March 30, and then made a bid to form its own administration. It later backed down after failing to woo support in India's hung lower house of parliament for a rival coalition.

Some Front leaders had suspected the Congress, who said its renewed support was conditional on the 64-year-old Deve Gowda's exit, might harbour secret ambitions of taking power. Kesri removed the doubts Friday.

The United Front's only remaining problem now is to find a consensus candidate suitable to all its centrist, leftist and regional parties. Front leaders said a search was on.

"Informal consultations are going on," said Doraiswamy Raja, a communist leader.

The new prime minister is widely expected to be G.K. Moopanar, a Tamil politician from the country's south. Others reportedly in the race include External Affairs Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.

The coming together of the Front and Congress is being attributed to their mutual fear of new elections, which they argue would favour the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party).

Both accuse the resurgent nationalists, who have been successful in a series of recent state polls, of religious bigotry.

The BJP said Friday another Front government was not the answer to the present crisis.

"The best solution is fresh election," BJP Vice President Krishan Lal Sharma told AFP. "No cosmetic change will be able to sort out the mess that has been created by the Congress and United Front."
