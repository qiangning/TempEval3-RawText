Suspected insurgents has placed suspicious packages in eight different locations in three districts of southern Spongkhla province bordering the predominantly Muslim southernmost border provinces.

The incidents coincided with the beginning of Eid-al-Fitr which marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting -- known locally as Hari Raya -- from Thursday through Saturday.

Police demolitions experts rushed to the sites only to discover that all the so-called "bombs" in Chana, Thepha and Saba Yoi districts of the province contained cattle manure and sand.

The investigators said they thought the bomb hoaxes were the work of militants who wished to create further disturbance on the Muslim holiday, according to local newspaper reports on Thursday.

The bomb hoaxes occurred less than 12 hours after a number of bomb incidents in Narathiwat province Wednesday night.

Police defused seven bombs in the provincial capital but another five bombs went off, downing 10 high-voltage power poles in Narathiwat city. The attacks caused power blackout in many areas.
