There is a growing number of Israeli citizens who are asking for Romanian citizenship, the national Rompres news agency reported on Saturday quoting Romania' s Ambassador to Israel Mariana Stoica as saying.

According to Stoica, the applicants are Jews originating from Romania who wish to re-acquire Romanian citizenship or second generation offspring of people born in Romania and who wish to get Romanian citizenship.

The main motivation for this growing number of applications consists in Romania becoming European Union member state starting on January 1, 2007, underlined the Romanian diplomat, adding that "This a sufficiently serious reason for them, to become citizens of an EU member country."

On the other hand, she pointed out that "there is an enhanced interest in investing in Romania and, in this case, it is a very good idea to hold Romanian citizenship".

"Third reason is that a great number of young people whose parents are of Romanian origin go to study in Romania, especially Medicine and Economics," said the ambassador.

According to the latest population figures, more than 110,000 of Israel's six million residents are from Romania, those Romanian jews arrived in Israel mostly in 1948-1951. Dual nationality is allowed now in Romania as well as in Isreal.
