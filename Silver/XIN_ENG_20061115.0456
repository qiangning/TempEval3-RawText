Denver Nuggets' forward Kenyon Martin underwent season-ending surgery on his right knee, the National Basketball Association club announced Wednesday.

Arthroscopic surgery had revealed more significant damage than was indicated on an earlier MRI, signaling an end to Martin's season and the loss of a key teammate for Carmelo Anthony.

Martin collected 19 points and 20 rebounds in the first two games of the season, but swelling in the right knee forced him to miss last Wednesday's game against the New York Knicks.

Last season, Martin was limited to 56 games due to soreness in the left knee and averaged 12.9 points and 6.3 rebounds.

Obtained from New Jersey for three first-round picks, Martin signed a seven-year contract worth 90 million dollars in July of 2004. Martin helped the Nets reach the NBA Finals twice in his first four NBA season.

Martin underwent microfracture surgery on his left knee after averaging 15.5 points and 7.3 rebounds in his first season with the Nuggets.
