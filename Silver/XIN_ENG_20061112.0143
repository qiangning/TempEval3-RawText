The APEC-2006 Economic Leaders' Week on Nov. 12-19 will provide a golden opportunity for Vietnamese businesses to promote their products, a Vietnamese business leader told local media prior to the event.

"As the host of the APEC Year 2006, our enterprises must take full advantage of the golden opportunities brought about by leaders and enterprises of APEC member economies in 2006 and the following years," Vietnam News Agency quoted Hoang Van Dung, Deputy Chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( VCCI), as saying on Sunday.

Dung, who is also President of the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC)-2006, also said that the question is what the Vietnamese business circles should do to capitalize on the opportunity.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economic leaders' week will include a CEO Summit, an ABAC conference, an APEC investment forum and a trade and investment promotion forum called Doing Business with Vietnam, which have drawn hundreds of business executives from 21 member economies, in addition to the APEC economic leaders' meeting.

At the meetings, Dung said, "We will propose that APEC economic leaders work together for the establishment of a free trade zone among APEC members as soon as possible."

A development policy for small and medium-sized businesses, which provides assistance in capital and personnel training, simplifies administrative procedures and helps improve businesses' competitive edge by reducing input costs will also be proposed at the meetings, said Dung.
