China and Japan went head to head Saturday in the Asian Games pool with the Japanese taking an early edge in the hunt for six opening day gold medals.

Maki Mita of Japan set the trend in the women's 200m freestyle with the fastest qualifying time of 2:00.44 ahead of Pan Jiaying of China, the Olympic relay silver medallist.

China's defending champion Yang Yu held off Lee Ji-Eun of South Korea in her heat to win in 2:02.75sec and tipped herself to retain her title.

"In tonight's final I will try to better my time from the morning," she said. "My biggest rival is myself."

Yang collected three gold medals in the Aian Games four years ago and qualified with the third fastest time of 2:02.75, ahead of Japan's Norie Urae, who claimed a place in the final on her 20th birthday.

In the women's 100m butterfy, Zhou Yafei of China won her head-to-head in the heats with Japan's Ayako Doi and both go forward to the evening's final along with Yuko Nakanishi, who came second to Tao Li of Singapore in a tactical first heat.

Nakanishi, the Olympic bronze medallist over 200m, is the butterfly racer Chinese swimmers fear most, but she said she needs to swim faster to conquer here.

"I was surpised that my qualifying time was so slow," she said.

Rising star Wang Qun, only 13, claimed her heat with ease in the 50m breastroke and will be up against team-mate Ji Liping, the Asian champion, in the final.

Ji was the only Chinese to post the fastest qualifying time and goes into the final ahead of Japan's Asami Kitagawa and Yoshimi Miwa, who said that the team's goal was to put an end to Chinese dominance in the swimming pool.

China won 20 swimming titles to Japan's 11 in the last Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, four years ago, with the women taking 13 to only three for the Japanese women.

"The aim of the Japanese team is to beat China," said Miwa.

In men's events Japan domminated qualifying with Hidemasa Sano posting the fastest time in the 400m individual medley.

In the 200m butterfly Japan's top two, Ryuichi Shinata and Takeshita Matsuda led qualifying ahead of Wu Peng and Chen Yin of China.
