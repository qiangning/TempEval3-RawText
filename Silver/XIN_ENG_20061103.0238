Madagascan President Marc Ravalomanana Friday said he hopes more Chinese companies enter Madagascar to expand cooperation with local businesses in infrastructure construction, agriculture, personnel training, health care and environment protection.

In a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao in Beijing, the president referred to China as an important partner and sincere friend.

Madagascar faces an arduous task in boosting national development and is implementing a new blueprint, he said.

Hu said China and Madagascar have maintained close high-level contacts and initiated cooperation in infrastructure construction and agriculture.

The Chinese president expressed hope that the two governments establish a more effective communication and coordination mechanism in order to hold timely discussions on ways to boost bilateral relations.

"We should implement trade and economic cooperation projects we have agreed upon and tap potentials for further cooperation," he said.

Meanwhile, it is also important to cement multilateral cooperation. "China supports the active role Madagascar has played in the Indian Ocean regional affairs," said Hu.

Ravalomanana arrived in Beijing Friday morning for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation slated for Nov. 4- 5.

So far, 47 delegations of the 48 African countries that have diplomatic ties with China, including 41 heads of state or government, have arrived for the summit featuring "friendship, peace, cooperation and development".

China and Madagascar forged diplomatic relations on Nov. 6, 1972. Bilateral trade amounted to 197 million U.S. dollars in 2005.
