Japan coach Zico said his side were prepared to face five-time world champions and his home country Brazil in the group stage of the World Cup finals in Germany next year.

"A team that has qualified for the World Cup finals must be prepared for any situation whatsoever," Zico told Japanese television in Leipzig after the World Cup draw there. "I thought about the possibility of fighting Brazil.

"For us, it is easier to encounter Brazil in the first round. It is better than fighting them after winning through to the second round," said the former Brazilian World Cup hero, who attended the draw Friday with Japanese Football Association president Saburo Kawabuchi.

Japan, the Asian champions, were drawn into Group F, which also included Croatia and Australia.

"It was not so bad," Kawabuchi said of the result. "We did not wish to be in Group C with the Netherlands and Argentina. We ended up in a medium group.

"Coach Zico told me with a smile that we would be alright. Emotionally, it might be a bit tough for him to fight his home country," the FA president said.

"But it will be the last match in the group and we had better qualify for the final tournament in the first two matches before facing Brazil," the FA president said.

Japan sprang a surprise at the Confederations Cup last June when they battled to a 2-2 draw against Brazil before fading in the group round.

Zico took over Japan after they reached the last-16 round at the 2002 World Cup finals on home turf under Frenchman Philippe Troussier. He has vowed to do better at Germany 2006.

Zico described Australia, who have qualified for the finals for the first time in 32 years, as a "highly motivated team" under Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.

"They are well guided. It will be very important for us to win the first match and boost the morale of my players," Zico said. Japan will face Australia in their opening match on June 12.

Zico said he had few worries about Croatia, who beat Japan 1-0 in their winless World Cup finals debut at France 1998. Croatia finished third in that tournament.

"We have fought Serbia-Montenegro and Slovakia and we are used to such a European team," Zico said.

Japanese supporters were delighted at the result of the draw, and many spent all night at sports bars to see the draw live on television in the early morning local time.

"It will be great to fight Brazil in terms of competition," a young man told public broadcaster NHK. And a young woman said, "We will definitely win the first match. I wish for miracles thereafter."
