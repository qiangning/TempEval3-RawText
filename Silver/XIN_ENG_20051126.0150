The Gabonese opposition held here a large-scale rally Saturday, gathering support for Pierre Mambounbou, who was defeated in last elections and vowed to replace Africa's longest serving leader Bongo Ondimba in Sunday's polls.

Several thousands of people, dressed in red T-shirts, symbolic for Union of Gabonese People Party, accumulated in the capital's Rio district in the afternoon, dancing and singing to show their support for Mambounbou.

"We need change, Gabon needs change. Bongo has been president for nearly 40 years, it's too long and there's not much change in our country," said Demar, a crane driver in Libreville.

Despite of the challenges from other four candidates, Bongo is widely expected to win Sunday's elections that are seen as a one- sided contest which will prolong his 38 years rule in Gabon.

Gabon is one of the few countries in central Africa that has never -- since its independence from France -- been affected by an armed conflict.

It is a small country with only about 1.5 million people, yet Gabon's people has one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa, largely due to the country's substantial revenues from petroleum exports.
