North Koreans who risk imprisonment and torture to flee the impoverished Stalinist state also face repatriation if caught by China and a hostile reception if they reach South Korea, rights activists said Thursday.

Marcus Noland and Andrei Lankov, two of the co-authors of a new report, urged Beijing and Seoul to alleviate the plight of the refugees, estimated to number between tens to hundreds of thousands.

"Everybody wants North Koreans to die quietly without making too much noise," said Lankov, a professor at Seoul's Kookmin University.

With six-party talks on scrapping North Korea's nuclear programme set to resume Monday, Noland said it was understandable the nuclear issue received attention.

But human rights issues would also have to be dealt with eventually if the North were to integrate with the world, and silence did not encourage better behavour by Pyongyang.

"People have treated North Korea with kid gloves and the result has been a missile test and a nuclear test," Noland, a senior fellow of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, told a press conference.

The report by the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea is based on interviews with more than 1,300 refugees hiding in China.

Noland said Pyongyang's "systematic denial of human, civil and political rights combined with economic incompetence" and food shortages were the cause of the refugee crisis.

But China's response was "harassment, arrest and forced return -- as many as 200 a week in some periods," he said.

The report urges China to honour its international obligations to refugees and to stop maintaining -- despite "incontrovertible evidence" to the contrary -- that the North Koreans are economic migrants.

"Its obstinacy has blocked what would otherwise be a massive international response in the form of assistance and protection."

The report urges Beijing to allow the establishment of temporary refugee resettlement camps, together with third-country commitments to accept the North Koreans for permanent resettlement.

It says almost 10 percent of interviewees had previously been in prison or labour camps and a majority of the ex-prisoners had witnessed hunger-related deaths or deaths due to torture.

A few also reported cases of infanticide involving mixed-race babies of women who became pregnant while in China.

The report terms South Korea's "increasingly unwelcoming" attitude to the refugees as "shamefully" ambivalent despite the tiny numbers who finally reach the South -- around 10,000 in the past half-century.

Noland said Seoul should insist that its embassies and consulates do their utmost to help refugees, who often take tortuous journeys via Mongolia, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries.

It should also consider reinstating substantial financial payments to refugees to prevent them falling prey to criminal trafficking gangs, he said.

Seoul feared jeopardising its "sunshine" engagement policy with the North and also saw refugees as an economic burden, Lankov said. Those who were accepted faced discrimination and problems finding jobs.

But Lankov argued that they should be seen as the "advance guard" of the inevitable eventual reunification of the peninsula after the North's system collapsed.

"The experience of living with them will be very helpful when living with not 10,000 but 24 million."
