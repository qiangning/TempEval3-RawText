Three Turkish engineers, who came to Pakistan to aid earthquake victims, were injured in a fire that broke out in their tent on Tuesday, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.

The report said the three were injured when their heating equipment suddenly caught flame, which set their tent on fire in the northwestern town Balakot which was largely flattened by the 7, 9-magnitude quake on Oct. 8.

Turkish Prime Ministry Emergency Management Directorate was quoted by Anatolia as saying that a military airplane would leave for Pakistan later on Tuesday and bring the three wounded engineers to Ankara for medical treatment at the Gulhane Military Hospital.

A powerful earthquake hit northern Pakistan on Oct. 8, killing more than 73,000 people and leaving three million homeless in the country.

Turkey is among the first batch of countries to offer aid to the quake-stricken Pakistan and has pledged to donate 150 million US dollars.
