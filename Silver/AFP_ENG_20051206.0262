Czech President Vaclav Klaus lined up Tuesday with opponents of the British proposal for a European Union budget, saying that it had been drawn up "to the detriment of new countries" of the EU.

"The main thing is not that Tony Blair has put forward a proposal to cut the budget. The main thing is to what extent this share out of the budget ... is just," Klaus commented on a visit to Pardubice, 100 kilometers east of Prague.

"I think this has been rather been done to the detriment of new countries [of the EU] and this is not fair," he added.

Klaus's comments are much more critical of the British budget proposal than those of social democrat prime minister Jiri Paroubek. Paroubek said on Monday that the British proposal "was at least worth very good consideration."

The British proposal includes a reduced EU budget for the 2007-2013 period with a cut in the British rebate accompanied by a reduction in regional aid targeted at new member states.
