Turkmenistan was due Sunday to bury its president-for-life, Saparmurat Niyazov, who died suddenly after two decades of ruling this gas-rich Central Asian nation, leaving no obvious heir.

Niyazov, who died Thursday at 66 from a heart attack, according to officials, was to be buried at the family mausoleum in his home village of Kipchak.

Police barred the road between the capital Ashgabat and Kipchak on Saturday and workers could be seen tidying the route where the funeral cortege for the self-declared Turkmenbashi, or Leader of all Turkmen, will pass from 0700 GMT.

Among the foreign presence will be Ukraine's Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and Turkish premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will attend the funeral, Turkmen state television said Saturday, and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan will also be present.

The United States will be represented by Richard Boucher, assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs.

Although few major foreign leaders will attend the ceremonies, Washington, Moscow and other major world capitals are watching closely as the succession process unfolds in the desert state, which contains huge natural gas supplies and occupies a strategic corner of energy-rich Central Asia.

The caretaker president, deputy prime minister Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, appeared on television late Friday promising the ex-Soviet republic would remain "stable." He also reassured foreign customers of Turkmen gas that deliveries would not be interrupted.

However, analysts predict a power struggle.

In one early sign, Berdymukhammedov on Friday sacked the parliamentary speaker, Ovezgeldy Atayev, who under the constitution was eligible to become interim leader. He has been charged with driving his son's fiancee to attempt suicide by forbidding their marriage because they were of different clans.

In a 21-year reign, Niyazov ruthlessly crushed dissent, declared himself president-for-life, and instituted an intense personality cult, naming months after himself and his mother, erecting gold statues of himself, and having his image adorn everything from banknotes to vodka bottles.

However, many ordinary Turkmens appeared to be in genuine shock at his death, saying they were lost without his guidance and fearful for the generous social policies he instituted.

The state funeral was to begin with the lying in state of Niyazov's body at Ashgabat's presidential palace at 0400 GMT.

The corpse would then be taken to the Kipchak mausoleum, a building constructed by French contractors and already containing the remains of Niyazov's father, who was killed in World War II, and his mother, who died in a huge earthquake in 1948, orphaning the future Turkmen leader in his childhood.

Alongside the mausoleum is Central Asia's biggest mosque, also French-built at a cost estimated at 100 million dollars (76 million euros).

The national mourning period will last until December 30.
