China will encourage more tourists to Kenya in an effort to boost the African country's economic growth and enhance exchanges, President Hu Jintao told visiting Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki Friday.

"We should expand exchanges between our governments, legislatures, parties and peoples to enhance understanding and trust," Hu told Kibaki who is in Beijing for a two-day summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation opening here Saturday.

The Chinese side is willing to train more management and technical professionals for Kenya and will encourage more people to visit Kenya, said Hu.

The number of Chinese visitors to Kenya has been on rise in the last four years, especially after China granted Kenya the Approved Destination Status for outbound Chinese tourist groups in 2004.

The World Tourism Organization has predicted that China will become the world's largest tourist market by 2020.

At the meeting, Hu also called on the two countries to expand trade and overall economic cooperation and enhance collaboration in international affairs.

Recalling his visit to Kenya in April, Hu said he reached extensive consensus with Kibaki on furthering Sino-Kenyan friendly cooperation.

"Our relevant departments are working to implement the consensus and have achieved positive results," he said. "Bilateral trade has continued to rise rapidly and new progress has been made in our cooperation in cultural, education and health sectors."

The development of Kenya-China relations is inspiring, said Kibaki, adding that his country is willing to explore ways to expand cooperation with China and enhance collaboration in international and regional affairs.

China established diplomatic relations with Kenya on Dec. 14, 1963. Kibaki's last visit to China was in 2005. Bilateral Trade totaled 475 million U.S. dollars in 2005.
