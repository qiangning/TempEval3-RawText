Thousands of people in western Germany spent their fourth night without electricity after this week's record snowfall damaged power lines throughout the region, authorities said on Tuesday.

As many as 35,000 people in the towns of Steinfurt and Borghorst had their power cut again after a pylon toppled, bringing others down with it. The region is expected to have its electricity supply switched back on next Tuesday.

Some 20,000 residents of Ochtrup will receive power from portable generators. Most farms in the area are being powered in this way. The blackout in the town has lasted four days, since the pylons along a three km stretch fell down under the weight of ice on Friday, German news agency DPA said.

Power had been restored to 200,000 people over the weekend in North Rhine-Westphalia, said the most populous state's Interior Ministry.

The weight of thick ice and snow, rarely seen in more than 100 years, damaged about 50 electric poles on Friday, throwing much of the region around the city of Muenster into darkness.

Police said that treacherous road conditions had caused 2,000 accidents leaving some 140 people injured and a damage bill which is expected to cost millions.

Power companies blamed the extreme weather conditions for the blackouts, rejecting any responsibility for the damage.

The government is likely to summon executives of electricity companies and civil-defense experts to explain the matter.
