Liberian security officials seized a craft belonging to the Sierra Leone Navy Friday after it was found to be carrying drugs, a Sierra Leone military spokesman said Saturday.

The spokesman said seven baskets of marijuana were hidden in the hull of the vessel when it berthed in the Freeport of Monrovia.

The vessel had travelled directly to Monrovia from Freetown carrying food and other logistics.

A Sierra Leone naval officer is now in detention and being questioned by military police of the West African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG). His name and rank have not been disclosed.

The military spokesman here described the incident as a "major embarrassment" but he did not say what charges were likely to be brought against the detained officer.

ECOMOG Field Commander Major-general Victor Malu quoted by Liberian radio said "this is not the first time that officers have betrayed the confidence" placed in them.

The arrested officer, diplomatic sources said, claimed to have been given the baskets by a woman trader in Freetown who told him that the consignment was foofoo - a starchy but edible foodstuff made up of pounded cassava - to deliver to a friend in Monrovia.
