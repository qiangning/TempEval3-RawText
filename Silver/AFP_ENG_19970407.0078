South Korea's Daewoo Motors Co. said Monday it would beef up its presence in the world market with three new passenger car models this year and more in the future to help it overcome domestic blues.

"Daewoo's strengthening globalization drive is in line with a worsening slump in the local market," said a Daewoo spokesman, Kim Hyung-Soo.

The country's third largest auto maker said in a statement Daewoo would double its research team, which now has 5,400 people worldwide, by 2000 to better cope with rapid changes in consumer demand.

The company runs auto design and technology centers in Britain and Germany.

"Starting in western Europe, three new models would penetrate into 60 countries worldwide from June," the spokesman said.

The three new entrants into the global market are Leganza with a 2,000-cc engine, Nubira with engine capacities of 1,800 cc and 1,500 cc and Lanos with a 1,500-cc engine.

Daewoo plans to introduce two or three new models targetting the world market every year in the coming years, using "global sourcing, global technology and global testing," the company said in the statement.

Company officials declined to give futher details on the plans.

Daewoo Motors, a flagship of Daewoo Business Group, chalked up a 69 percent rise in exports last year in line with its push to expand production facilities and marketing overseas.

The company shipped 471,104 vehicles abroad last year, compared with 280,508 in 1995, with exports to eastern Europe alone jumping 242 percent in 1996.

Thanks to brisk exports, Daewoo, unlike its stronger domestic rivals, posted an increase in net profits totalling 51.9 billion won (58 million dollars) last year, up from 10.5 billion won in 1995.

Its estimated revenue for 1996 amounted to 4.5 trillion won, up from 3.4 trillion won in the previous year, the company spokesman said.

The country's largest auto maker, Hyundai Motor Co. saw its 1996 net profit plunge 45 percent to 86.8 billion won, while the second largest Kia Motors Corp. recorded a 40 percent fall in net profit to 7.04 billion won.

Their profit slumps were compounded by fierce price competiton in a shrinking domestic market, analysts said.

Daewoo, which is due to drum up its production capacity from the current 1.58 million units a year to two million units at home and abroad by 2000, predicted 6.8 trillion won in sales and 70 billion won in net profit for 1997.
