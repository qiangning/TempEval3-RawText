African countries need funds, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and technology transfer to combat climate change, Kivutha Kibwana, president-designate of the UN Climate Change Conference has said.

African countries are the least emitters in the world whose emission only accounts for about 3 or 4 percent of the world's total. "They are impacted quite significantly by the climate change. Therefore they are frustrated that in this process they are not able to mobilize the funds that are required for particular adaptation." Kibwana said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.

One of the most important issues in this meeting is what people are going to do regarding the adaptation to climate change. It should be made sure that the fund is substantial, said Kibwana, who is also Kenya's minister for Environment and Natural Resources.

"We think that in Nairobi, those positions are required to be taken so the least developed countries and African countries can all feel that they are being supported to deal with the challenge of climate change," Kibwana said.

There are three funds established under Climate Change Convention and Kyoto Protocol to help developing countries. In them, the Adaptation Fund, which will be discussed in the Nairobi meeting to reach political agreement on how to be managed, is designated to finance practical adaptation projects and programs in developing countries and support capacity-building activities.

Kibwana also said that Africa emphasizes an equitable distribution of CDM projects . Part of the debates at the conference is on how to ensure the capacity of African and poor countries to develop CDM projects which permit industrialized countries to generate emission credits through investments in sustainable development projects which reduce emissions in developing countries.

In addition, Kibwana called for technology transfer to African countries which will help them to deal with the effects of climate change.

As the developed countries are discussing about the future while African and poor nations are concerned about immediate effects of climate change, the challenge of the meeting is to come up with a win-win situation for all blocks, the president said.

"According to a report from Britain, it is clear that the climate change is an extremely serious matter. We can not postpone on how to deal with it because the cost for not dealing with it today is so high in the future. And that is why it is my hope that this meeting is going to come up with concrete solutions," Kibwana said.
