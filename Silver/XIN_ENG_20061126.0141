With an aim to deliver a best ever Asian Games, Doha organizers are catering not only to the needs of athletes and officials, but also to more than 4,500 journalists from all over the world, including their palates.

"A big Thank You to the organizers, who provide delicious food in the Main Press Center," said Chinese reporter Xue Jianying, who has covered five Asian Games and as many Summer Olympics.

"The organizers are hospitable," he added.

The organizers offer two meals to the journalists each day, one breakfast in hotels and one in the Main Media Center, where an international buffet is served during the Games.

The buffet offers Arabian, Asian, continental and sub- continental dishes including salads, cheeses, cold cuts, pastries, fresh fruits, breads, preserves, cereals and beverages.

"I'd rather say that I have the best food in a sports meet after covering so many events," said another Chinese reporter Yang Ming.

"It is out of my expectation," said Yang's colleague Pan Yi. " After talking to the catering service manager, I know that there are 1,200 dishes on the menu, which means that the journalists will have different food for at least one week."

Athletes will enjoy more variety of fine cuisine.

Sun Yi, a Chinese reporter with Legal Mirror, wrote that he was impressed by the 4,800-seat dining hall and 5,000 different dishes.

"I spent 10 months on making the menu. I am sure from the opening of the Athletes' Village to its closing, the daily menu will not repeat at all," chef Chen Zhida, a Chinese Singaporean, was quoted by Sun.

It seems that the organizers have determined to give all participants the best taste of the Games.

"The organizing committee has employed a Master Caterer with extensive international and Olympic experience to work with us, to plan, liaise and deliver all catering requirements for the Games," said Yousef M Al Othman, Deputy Director General of the Doha organizing committee.

"The menus will not only meet the diverse cultural needs of our multi-national participants, but will also look at their vegetarian and medical considerations.

"We are aware of the athletes' culinary likes and dislikes, thanks to extensive research already done."
