Greek athletes, who finished in the top eight of their event in the 2004 Olympic Games or in world championships, were sworn in as officers of the three branches of the Greek Armed Forces in a ceremony held at the War Museum amphitheatre on Tuesday.

An honorary officer's post and salary is traditionally given to all top athletes that get medals or finish up to eighth place in major international competition.

Attending the swearing-in ceremony were Alternate Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia, Deputy Defence Minister Vassilis Mihaloliakos, the leadership of the armed forces and friends and relatives of the athletes.
