The dollar slipped against the yen in Asian trade Tuesday as the market waited for the Bank of Japan chief's remarks later in the day on interest rates, dealers said.

They said participants also wanted to see a batch of US economic indicators this week to glean clues on whether the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates on hold or cut them in early 2007.

The dollar slipped to 117.96 yen in Tokyo morning trade from 118.06 in New York late Monday.

The euro was quoted at 1.3086 dollars, down from 1.3097 and fell to 154.36 yen from 154.74.

Meanwhile, the Thai baht fell to 35.67 against the dollar Tuesday afternoon from 35.22 on Monday after the Bank of Thailand on Monday made a major intervention to curb the soaring currency.

The market largely ignored the Bank of Japan's announcement of keeping the benchmark rate of borrowing at a super-low 0.25 percent. The market had widely expected the decision after mixed economic data.

Dealers said the market's interest has now shifted to Governor Toshihiko Fukui's remarks later in the day for signals on when the bank will next hike ultra-low interest rates.

"Players were concerned about a swift advance in the dollar against the yen," said Saturo Ogasawara, strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.

"Players also refrained from buying the dollar ahead of the Bank of Japan's policy board meeting and Fukui's presser afterward," Ogasawara said.

The market is waiting for US producer price or factory gate data see if inflationary pressures remain, which would ease concern of a US rate cut early next year, dealers said.

The dollar pared back gains slightly overnight after the Commerce Department reported that the US balance of payments deficit worsened in the third quarter amid rising costs for oil and a jump in Chinese imports, dealers said.

But overall, it had little impact on the currency market as it was in line with expectations, they added.

"Our bias is to see the US dollar drift higher into year-end as sentiment continues to improve, especially if housing indicators stabilize and the large speculative net short (sell) position is further unwound," wrote National Australia Bank senior researcher John Kyriakopoulos in a note to clients.

The dollar gained ground against Asian currencies.

The dollar rose to 49.70 Philippine pesos Tuesday afternoon from 49.36 on Monday, to 9,128 Indonesian rupiah from 9,070 and to 32.68 Taiwan dollars from 32.55.

The greenback rose to 930.85 South Korean won from 924.9 and to 1.546 Singapore dollars from 1.541.
