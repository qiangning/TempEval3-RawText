Hong Kong should not be concerned at the deployment of Chinese troops here 71 days before the territory's handover in July, a government official said Monday.

Nicholas Ng, secretary for constitutional affairs, told Hong Kong's Legislative Council the arrival of the advance party of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Monday "should not worry" people here.

"I understand the public's concern," said Ng, but "I believe they will carry out their duty with discretion."

Ng's remarks came as a convoy of eight cars and vans brought 40 members of the PLA from the southern Chinese border city of Shenzhen into Hong Kong at Lok Ma Chau crossing point.

The advance troops are the first unit of the Chinese army to be deployed in Hong Kong since Britain seized the territory in January 1841.

Ng said the deployment was "appropriate for the task of preparing for the transfer of responsibilities," when Hong Kong returns to China on July 1.

He said the fact the PLA vehicles carried Hong Kong licence plates showed the Chinese army would heed the territory's laws and would be granted no special privileges.

The leader of the advance PLA party, Major-General Zhou Borong, was greeted by the commander of the British forces here, Major-General Bryan Dutton when he arrived at the high-rise barracks on the waterfront on Hong Kong Island.

Dutton gave a veiled warning about deep-rooted fears among the many Hongkongers who associate the PLA with bloody images of tanks crushing student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.

"We intend to give the future garrison every possible assistance as they prepare for their role," he said, before expressing the hope that "their relationship with the local community will be as constructive and rewarding as ours has been."

China, implicitly acknowledging such concerns, has repeatedly promised its Hong Kong garrison will be drawn from the finest and most disciplined ranks of its armed forces.

Up to 10,000 Chinese soldiers are expected to be based in Hong Kong after the handover, a figure roughly equal to British numbers before 1994.

The British strength is now around 1,800 which will fall to around 1,600 by the end of May, leaving only a few to be withdrawn in the final few weeks before the handover.
