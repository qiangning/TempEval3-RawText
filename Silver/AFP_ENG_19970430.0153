Russia's top negotiator in Chechnya, Ivan Rybkin, opened new peace talks Wednesday despite a series of bombings and criticised Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov for his attack on the Chechen separatist leadership.

Rybkin, the secretary of the Russian Security Council, said Kulikov's comments on Monday's bombing of a railway station in Pyatigorsk, southern Russia, were an attempt to disrupt the eight-month peace process.

"However many stars they have on their shoulders, people should not choke on their own ambitions. ... Those who fight organised crime should not break up the peace process and make political statements," Rybkin said on arrival in the Chechen capital Grozny, Interfax reported.

On Tuesday, Kulikov announced that two Chechen women had been arrested for the bombing in Pyatigorsk, which killed two people and hospitalised 15, and declared that the bombing showed the Chechen government was not in charge.

The women have been transferred to prison in Moscow, Russian news agencies said.

The Chechen government denied any involvement in the bombing, accusing the Russian security forces of carrying it out to disrupt negotiations, which began at the end of the 21-month war last August.

Rybkin was met at Grozny airport by the chief Chechen negotiator, first deputy prime minister Movladi Udugov, the head of the Chechen YUNKO oil company, and other officials, ITAR-TASS said.

Interfax reported earlier that Rybkin would meet with President Aslan Maskhadov.

Boris Berezovsky, deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, accompanied Rybkin.

Meanwhile President Boris Yeltsin, on holiday in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, met with Kulikov.

The Chechens, who declared independence in 1991, drove out Russian troops in the war, which killed tens of thousands of people and left the tiny republic in ruins.

Moscow continues to insist Chechnya is part of Russia and talks on future relations and economic aid for Chechnya have bogged down over the last few months. Throughout the war, Kulikov was one of the key backers of a military solution.
