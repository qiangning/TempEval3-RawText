British mercenary boss Tim Spicer, freed in Papua New Guinea on the eve of his trial for illegal firearms possession, told Thursday how he was threatened with a gun to his head and beaten up after being captured there.

Spicer, who arrived back in Britain late Wednesday, said he narrowly missed death on a number of occasions after being captured by local defence forces who staged a civil and military revolt after his mercenary band were discovered.

The former British soldier told a news conference in London that he was beaten up, intimidated and threatened with death by rebels in the local army before being dramatically released on Tuesday.

He condemned Papua New Guinea Defence Force Brigadier General Jerry Singirok, and accused him of betrayal.

Spicer, 44, said he and his 65 mercenaries were recruited for 24 million pounds (39 million dollars) by the government of the South Sea nation to help overthrow a nine-year rebellion on the copper-rich island of Bougainville.

He was arrested three weeks ago, was mistreated for six days and then placed under house arrest until charges against him were dropped, he told assembled reporters.

His military consultancy company Sandline International had only been paid half the agreed fee, he said, and was negotiating for the rest of the money and for the return of equipment, including helicopters.

The company was cooperating fully with the Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate the government's hiring of Spicer's Sandline International mercenary group, he added.

"We have acted both legally and constitutionally at the behest of both the government and military," Spicer said.
