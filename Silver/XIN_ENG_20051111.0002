A total of 30 pilgrims embarked Friday on a 500-km march for world peace from central to western Nepal, the leader of the pilgrims' team said here.

"The team began their journey from Namobuddha hill of Kavre district and will finally pray for world peace at the sacred garden of Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, after walking for 25 days," Lam Ty Ni, leader of the pilgrims' team, told reporters.

The team included 15 Nepalese, 10 Vietnamese, three Indians, one Japanese and a Korean, said Lam, who came to Lumbini in 1969 in search of peace from war-torn Vietnam and started working for the development of the holy shrine.

The pilgrimage has a spiritual as well as a symbolic meaning, Lam noted, adding, "The prayer will lead to an atmosphere for peace and hoped after seeing young and old people walking for peace, the Nepali authorities will feel the necessity to do something for the peace."

The team includes the eldest member 62-year-old monk and the youngest 17-year-old nun, Lam revealed.

"All the concerned including the political parties, the king and the anti-government guerrillas of Nepal should sit together for resolving the decade-long war and let people live in peace and happiness," he added.

Over 12,000 Nepalese people have been killed since the anti- government insurgency took place in the Himalayan kingdom in February 1996.
