The fifth-round of the six-party talks will begin on Nov. 9 in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan announced at a regular press conference here Thursday.

Kong did not say how long the negotiation would last, but said that "holding the talks by phases in the new round could have a better result" as the chief negotiators of the six parties might also attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit slated for mid November in Pusan of the Republic of Korea (ROK).

The experience in the last round of the talks has proved that it is a "good idea" to hold the talks by phases, the spokesman added.

"We hope the participants in the new round of negotiation could have an in-depth exchange of views on the consensus reached in the last round," said Kong.

The six-party talks, aiming at resolving the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula, group China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the United States, the Republic of Korea, Russia and Japan. The first round was held in August 2003 in Beijing.

"If all parties could take commitment to commitment and action to action based on the joint statement reached during the fourth round of the talks, and earnestly push forward the discussion and agree to take further steps, there would be positive result," Kong said.

The fourth-round six-party talks ended on Sept. 19 with the adopting of the first joint statement. The DPRK pledged in the statement to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and return, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

The United States affirms that it has no nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula and has no intention of attacking or invading the DPRK with nuclear or conventional weapons, says the statement.
