Some goalkeepers study videos, others look for clues in the eyes of their opponents.

But when North Korea goalkeeper Jon Myong Hui faces down a penalty, she dreams of a short, chubby, bespectacled dictator with his finger on the nuclear button.

Jon's secret of the shootout is to think of North Korean leader Kim Jung Il.

"I thought of our Great Leader and I knew with his encouragement and trust in us we would get the victory," said the 20-year-old who saved two Japanese spotkicks in a 4-2 shootout win which gave North Korea a second successive Asian Games women's football gold.

"I looked to the skies of Pyongyang and drew inspiration from him. I only wish he could have been here in person. I hope that our Great Leader Kim Jung Il gets the news of this victory and that he is happy."

The defending champions, Asia's highest-ranked team, enjoyed the better chances throughout a dour final and held their nerve at the end.

North Korea scored all of their penalties with Ri Kum Suk, Ri Un Gyong, Ho Sun Hui and Jong Pok Sim finding the target while Jon kept out Kozue Ando and Homare Sawa.

Despite the victory, North Korean coach Kim Kwang Min was disappointed.

"Although we are similar physically we are better players," said Kim.

"I told them to be aggressive from the start and we should have won in 90 minutes."

Kim has big plans for his team but admits that in his hermit, Stalinist homeland, finding information on other sides in the world is not easy.

"Our initial goal was to be the best in Asia and after that we aim to be the best in the world," he said.

"I'm not quite sure of the standard of football in Europe or the Americas. Once we learn this we will work out a plan to beat them."

Japan coach Hiroshi Ohashi took responsibility for the defeat which left the Japanese still searching for a first Asian Games gold medal.

"I feel responsible for not creating a team which was able to win the match in 90 or 120 minutes," he said.

Japan goalkeeper Miho Fukumoto made a series of good saves to keep her side in the match while Eriko Arakawa set-up Japan's best opportunity in the 72nd minute.

The afro-haired striker skipped inside two defenders, drew the goalkeeper and released the ball into the path of Shinobu Ohno who missed from six yards.

Ohno had the ball in the net in extra time but her smart volley was controversially ruled out for offside.

China grabbed the bronze medal with a 2-0 win against South Korea thanks to two goals from Wang Kun.
