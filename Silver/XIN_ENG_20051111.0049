Non-seeded Zheng Bo/Zhao Tingting from China upset world No.1 Widianto Nova/Natsir Liyana of Indonesia 15-9, 17-15 for the semi-finals at the China Open badminton here on Friday.

"It's very normal for us to win or lose," said Zhao Tingting, "The key point is the actual pefermance and luck on court."

Zhao Tingting used to pair with veteran Chen Jiqiu, and it's first time for Zhao and Zheng to be partners after Chen retired from national team.

The winning Chinese duo will next meet England's fifth-seeded Nathan Robertson/Gail Emms, who beat Anthony Clark/Kenneth Kellogg of Denmark in the third round.

Second-seeded Lee Jae Jin/Lee Hyo Jung of South Korea beat Daniel Shirley/Runesten-Petersen of New Zealand 13-15, 15-4 and 15-4.
