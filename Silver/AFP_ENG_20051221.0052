A businessman was tackled by passengers and later died after molesting a young woman on a packed rush-hour train in Japan, where groping is a chronic problem, police said Wednesday.

The 40-year-old businessman groped the 20-year-old student during morning rush hour Tuesday in Osaka and then tried to run out at busy Tennoji Station.

But he was followed by a 32-year-old off-duty police officer and three other male passengers who tackled him on the platform. The man lost consciousness and died later in the day in a nearby hospital, a police spokesman said.

"We are looking into the cause of death and details about how he was overpowered by the passengers," he said. Police did not immediately identify the man.

Japan has begun cracking down on groping after legions of stories of men getting away with fondling and groping on busy trains.

In 2001, Tokyo raised penalties for groping and rail operators began running all-women carriages. But Tokyo police last year reported a record high 2,201 cases of groping on the metropolis's trains.
