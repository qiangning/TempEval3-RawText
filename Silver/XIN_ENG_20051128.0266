A US congressman pleaded guilty Monday to bribe charges that he sold his home to a defense contractor at an inflated price in 2003.

In a court hearing in San Diego, California, the 63-year-old Republican congressman Randy "Duke" Cunningham answered "yes" when asked by US District Judge Larry Burns if he had accepted bribes from someone in exchange for his performance of official duties.

He now faces a maximum of ten years in jail and a fine.

Prosecutors said two years ago, Cunningham and his wife sold their home for over 1.6 million US dollars to a defense contractor named Mitchell Wade and then used the proceeds from the sale to buy a 2.55-million-dollar mansion.

A year later, Wade put Cunningham's old home back on the market and sold it for less than a million dollars.

Wade also let Cunningham live rent-free on his yacht while his firm, MZM Inc., donated generously to Cunningham's political campaigns.

By bribing Cunningham, Wade and MZM won several valuable defense contracts, since the congressman sits on the House Appropriations Subcommittee which controls defense budgets.

Cunningham, a former Vietnam War pilot who has been in Congress since 1991, announced in July that he wouldn't seek re-election next year.

He drew little notice outside his San Diego-area district before a local newspaper reported last June that he sold the home to Wade.
