Burmese authorities on Wednesday criticized the United States for imposing economic sanctions on the military-ruled country, while its trading partners declined to follow the US example.

A Burmese official accused the US government of using economic sanctions, announced by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Washington on Tuesday, to boost its political stock at home.

"The sanctions imposed by the US on Myanmar (Burma) is for the domestic political consumption," the military official said in a short and terse statement received here in response to questions from AFP.

The official also accused the United States of trying to use democracy and human rights as a means of boosting its influence in the region, and said the move would not alter the course being taken by the Burmese government.

"From Myanmar, we have our own set aims and objectives for the good of the nation," he said. "Since Myanmar is working on a straight line towards our goal, we do not have any reason to deviate from our original path."

Albright said the investment ban was due to severe restrictions imposed by the military on the activities of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD).

The Burmese official's comments were echoed by China, long a critic of the linking of human rights and trade issues by Washington.

"China is always against interference in other countries' internal affairs by making use of economic means," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said.

"Isolating and excluding (Burma) will only increase tensions and aggravate confrontation, and will benefit no side," the spokesman said.

Many of Burma's leading trade partners said they would not follow the US example and that Rangoon's bid to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) would be unaffected by the sanctions.

"We understand what the US has done, but ASEAN will stick to its agreements and our decision will not depend on other countries," Thai Prime Minister Chaowalit Yongchaiyudh told reporters in Bangkok.

He said that ASEAN -- which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- was committed to its decision taken last year to admit Burma at the same time as Cambodia and Laos.

Although the grouping failed to give a date for the entry of the three countries, analysts believe that they will be admitted before the end of the year to mark ASEAN's 30th anniversary.

Chaowalit said ASEAN would discuss the issue further at a special foreign ministers meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month.

Malaysia also voiced its intention to have Burma brought on board.

"We are going to work very hard to get Myanmar into ASEAN," the Bernama news agency quoted Malaysian Premier Mahathir Mohamad as saying.

Japan and Australia issued statements saying they would not follow the US example in slapping sanctions on Burma, although both have criticized Rangoon for its human rights record.

"We have no plan for any sanctions at this moment," a foreign ministry official said in Tokyo. "Our stance has not been changed."

Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said through a spokesman that Canberra had already imposed a number of restrictions on dealings with Burma and had consistently condemned the Burmese junta.

But he added: "I don't believe that the imposition of similar measures by Australia against new investment in Burma would make any significant difference to the situation."

Meanwhile, a leading Burmese dissident group called on the international community to launch a coordinated effort to follow the US initiative.

The All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) said in a statement that a multilateral approach with regard to economic sanctions was needed to force Burma's ruling junta into bringing about political reform.

Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly called for international sanctions on Burma, a stance which has been backed by most Burmese dissident groups.

The United States, thanks largely to the involvement of Unocal Corp. in a 1.2 billion dollar gas pipeline project, is currently the fourth largest investor in Burma in terms of approved investments.
