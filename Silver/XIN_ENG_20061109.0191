Russia expected Iran to freeze uranium enrichment and confirm that its nuclear program will remain exclusively civilian, a senior Russian lawmaker said on Thursday.

"Russia will expect Iran to pledge to freeze its current (uranium) enrichment program until all queries are clarified," Konstantin Kosachyov, Chairman of International Affairs Committee of Russia's lower parliament, said in a commentary posted on the United Russia Party's website.

"We expect Tehran to provide exhaustive confirmation that Iran's nuclear program is not military, that Iran does not plan to transform the current civilian program into a military one, and that it will abide by the nuclear weapons nonproliferation regime, " Kosachyov said.

Russia wanted Tehran to provide detailed confirmation that "it will continue cooperating fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and ultimately seek a regime of interaction with the world community that would dispel all suspicion regarding its nuclear program," Kosachyov said.

Iranian Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani will visit Moscow on Friday for talks in the Russian Security Council and the Foreign Ministry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said here Thursday.
