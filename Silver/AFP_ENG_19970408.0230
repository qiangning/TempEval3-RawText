Jakarta shares closed 0.2 percent higher Tuesday on the back of late interest in bank stocks and selective third-liners, with the broader market mostly sidelined, dealers said.

"I think the news that BNI has cut its deposit rates by 0.5 percent attracted some interest in it, as well as some of the other banks," Usaha Bersama Sekuritas institutional sales manager Alastair Bruce said.

The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index closed up 1.58 points at 638.22.

Estimated turnover was 181.4 million shares worth an estimated 354 billion rupiah (146.2 million dollars).

Dealers said volumes were dominated by speculative buying in third- line Bank Pikko and BNI.

Bruce said although the "braver investors" may wish to beat an "inevitable rush into the market, post-elections," most are being very cautious.

He said continued news of riots in Pekalongan, Central Java province, "looks bad" and "makes people extrapolate on the likelihood of it happening in Jakarta."

A dealer with a European brokerage said the market was partly supported by buying in Telkom early on and then by banks. But excluding two crossings in Matahari and Bimantara, volumes were otherwise very thin, he said.

Telkom closed unchanged at 3,575 rupiah, while Indosat was down 75 rupiah at 6,350 rupiah.

BNI closed up 50 rupiah at 1,350 rupiah, BII was 50 rupiah higher at 1,754 rupiah and BDNI gained 100 rupiah to 2,225 rupiah.

Bank Pikko was up 2,700 rupiah at 4,000 rupiah before dealing was suspended at 2:24 pm.

Dealers said the sharp gain in the stock remains unexplained, although there has been a rumour that a "prominent businessman" is seeking an interest in the company.
