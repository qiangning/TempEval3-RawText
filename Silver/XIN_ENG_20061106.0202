A wind-fueled wildfire burned 300 acres of brush in southern California Monday, threatening homes and choking the sky with gray clouds of smoke, officials said.

Firefighters rushed to Fontana in San Bernadino Country, some 80 km east of Los Angeles, after the fire began about 7:35 a.m near Ineterstate 15, the main road from southern California to Las Vegas.

About 150 firefighters were at the scene, where a golf course and a development of houses were nearby.

The fire began in vegetation but spread south to a walled commercial lot used for the assembly and storage of wooden pallets, according to a Los Angeles Times website report.

Exploding propane tanks in the pallet yard sent debris across the street, but no damage to the homes was reported, said Fontana Mayor Mark Nuaimi.

The blaze came as southern California authorities issued a red flag warning indicating a high risk of wildfires because of strong winds, high heat and low humidity. The warning was due to expire at 6 p.m.

Four firefighters were killed last month in a rampant wind- driven wildfire, which was apparently caused by an arson and burned some 40,000 acres of rugged terrain and destroyed 34 houses in the nearby Riverside County.

Another firefighter died last week, failing to survive the burns over 90 percent of his body when the flames swept over the National Forest Service fire crew in the Riverside fire.
