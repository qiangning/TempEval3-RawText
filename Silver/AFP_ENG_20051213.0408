More than 700 Iraqis living in Turkey cast votes for their homeland's new parliament on Tuesday, according to a representative for the Iraqi electoral commission there.

Turkey is one of 15 countries where Iraqi expatriates can vote in Iraq's parliamentary elections. Three polling stations have been set up in Istanbul and one in Ankara.

Expatriates have until Thursday to cast their ballot when their homeland will grind to a halt under security measures intended to minimise bloodshed as the electorate chooses a 275-member parliament.

Mufit Neftci, a representative of the electoral commission in charge of Iraqi exiles in Turkey, said by late afternoon Tuesday between 700 and 800 Iraqis had cast ballots.

"We think that the number of voters will be more than in the last elections," Neftci said, referring to the January 28 poll for an interim parliament in Iraq.

"Any Iraqi who comes to the polling station with a valid identity card including a photograph is allowed to vote," he said.

Neftci could not give an estimate of the number of Iraqis in Turkey who are eligible to vote.

The International Migrants Organization, which organized the January poll, had estimated the number at around 30,000, most of them belonging to the Turkish minority that settled mainly in northern Iraq.

The ethnic Turks in Iraq make up the country's third largest ethnic group after the Arabs and the Kurds.

Besides Turkey, the other countries where Iraqi expatriates may vote include Australia, Austria, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Sweden, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.
