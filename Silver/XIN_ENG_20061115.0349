The top U.S. commander for the Middle East said Wednesday that American troops in Iraq should not be reduced, and that he would not recommend troop withdrawals.

"Under current circumstances, I would not recommend troop withdrawals," General John Abizaid, commander of the Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Specific timetables "limit that flexibility," he said.

Abizaid also said he did not see the need to increase the number of U.S. soldiers in Iraq. "I do not believe that more American troops right now is the solution to the problem," he said.

The United States has about 141,000 troops in Iraq at present.

Abizaid said levels of sectarian violence in Iraq were still dangerously high, but he was "optimistic" that American forces could stabilize Iraq.

Asked by lawmakers how long it would take to quell the ongoing sectarian violence in Iraq, Abizaid said the U.S. military and Iraqi forces had four to six months to get the levels of sectarian violence down before it tipped into civil war.

The key to stabilize Iraq was "effective, loyal, non-sectarian Iraqi security forces coupled with an effective government of national unity," he said.

Abizaid said American commanders believed that Iraqi security forces could take control of security responsibilities faster if the U.S. military beefed up training teams embedded with the Iraqis, speeded up the delivery of equipment, and helped Iraqi authorities to root out militias.

Abizaid's testimony before the Senate committee came after last week's congressional elections, in which Democrats won control of both chambers of Congress largely due to American voters' dissatisfaction with the situation in Iraq.

President George W. Bush has faced enormous pressure for a major change in his Iraq policy.

Bush formally launched a sweeping internal review of the Iraq policy on Tuesday, pulling together studies underway by various government agencies, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.

The initiative paralleled the effort by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which had conducted interviews with the president, his foreign policy team, military leaders and Democrats, and was expected to make recommendations on the government's Iraq policy next month.
