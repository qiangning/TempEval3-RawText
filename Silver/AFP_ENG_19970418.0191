Poland is seeking to boost political ties and exports of military hardware, engineering and chemical products to Thailand and other southeast Asian countries, the Polish foreign minister said here Friday.

Dariusz Rosati told reporters Poland's broad industrial base stood the former Warsaw Pact nation in good stead for a regional market in Asia that holds "enormous potential and economic prospects."

"We should have much more trade and political cooperation with the (southeast Asian) region," he said, midway through a three-day official visit to Thailand.

Rosati noted Poland has a strong armament sector and discussions with Thailand would cover possible exports of Polish-made military hardware, which included tanks, guns, boats and helicopters.

He added Poland was also open for investment "in every field" from Thailand, including tourism, garment industries and electronics. Foreign investment in Poland was between six and seven billion dollars in 1996.

Part of Poland's regional strategy for reaching into southeast Asia was to join the Asian Development Bank (ADB), he said.

This had been discussed with bank officials in Manila in an earlier stop on the minister's current swing through southeast Asia. He was hopeful of Poland joining the ADB next year.

The foreign minister said he was "very satisfied" with discussions with Thai Prime Minister Chaowalit Yongchaiyudh Thursday, which included an exchange of views on the political situation in southeast Asia and the prospects for Poland's entry into NATO and the European Union.

He was holding talks Friday at the ministry of industry and trade and on Saturday was scheduled to meet with his Thai counterpart Prachuab Chaiyasarn.

They would sign an agreement on cooperation between the Thai and Polish justice ministries, regarding the enforcement of court sentences and the transfer of prisoners, Rosati said.

There are currently eight Poles serving sentences or awaiting trial in Thai prisons on narcotics charges.

Rosati's visit, which included earlier stops in Indonesia and the Philippines, is the foreign minister's first in southeast Asia. It follows a visit to Thailand by the Polish Premier Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz last year.

Two-way trade between the two countries in 1996 was worth 9.58 billion baht (369 million dollars), with the balance of trade more than one billion baht in Poland's favour, a Thai official said.
