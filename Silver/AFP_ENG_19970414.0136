About 150 cases of cholera have been registered among tens of thousands of ailing Rwandan refugees waiting to be repatriated from eastern Zaire, the UN refugee agency said Monday.

UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Paul Stromberg said at least five refugees had died of the disease but that it should not hinder the repatriation process.

Although the 150 others were suspected cases for the moment, humanitarian organisations believed they were likely to be cholera. Three positive cases were confirmed last week.

A total of 60 to 100 refugees die every day from disease and malnutrition as they wait for repatriation from their makeshift camps south of Kisangani, the rebel-held city in northeast Zaire.

"Since last week, measures have been taken to isolate and treat suspected cases of cholera, which is endemic in the region. Medicines, soap, have been supplied in sufficient quantities. I don't think it will spread," Stromberg added by telephone from Kigali.

He said it was not thought to be a virulent form of the disease, and that the repatriation process should go ahead as planned.

Cholera, dysentery and malaria are among the many health perils facing approximately 80,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees around the rebel-held city.

The emaciated and ill refugees fled from advancing rebels who now control eastern Zaire. The refugees have had no access to relief food or medical care for most of the six months of the rebellion.

The rebels, who captured Kisangani on March 15, gave a green light 10 days ago for UN agencies to set up an air-bridge to repatriate the Rwandans.
