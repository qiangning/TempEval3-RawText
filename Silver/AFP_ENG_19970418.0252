Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, who hopes to ban political donations from abroad, admitted Friday he had made "modest" contributions in the past to Britain's ruling Conservative Party.

Tung's comments came amid a growing row with the democratic lobby over his plans to tighten human rights law, including banning donations from foreign individuals and political organisations.

He has argued that such a move would prevent outside influence on local politicians.

"As a person I have in the past made modest donations to the Conservative Party, that's well known to everyone," Tung told reporters Friday.

"As a result of that I am particularly sensitive that this should not happen in Hong Kong."

Tung's comments were rounded on by local legislators.

"It looks like a question of 'do as I say, not as I do," said independent legislator Emily Lau.

"Everyone understands that this is a sensitive matter. I think the overriding concern is that we should not make drastic changes... there is no public outcry for such drastic changes."

"He does it and now he wants to ban people from doing it".

"What a laugh," said fellow legislator Christine Loh on hearing the news.

"Why did he give it? In order to influence the British Government?"

At the time of his donations Tung held a British National Overseas passport, which he has since rescinded.

His proposed law changes do not cover political donations from Hong Kong residents to parties overseas.

Tung was granted a Chinese passport by Beijing in January, shortly after he was confirmed as Chief Executive-designate. He will take over as Hong Kong's leader from Governor Chris Patten, a former Conservative MP, on July 1 when China assumes sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain.
