Switzerland's central bank said Thursday it was raising its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 0.50 percent to 1.50 percent.

The Swiss National Bank said in a statement that its first interest rate change since June 2004 was aimed at keeping the outlook for inflation under control amid the expected recovery in the Swiss economy.
