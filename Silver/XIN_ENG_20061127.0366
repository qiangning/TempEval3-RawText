Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa issued on Monday a letter giving green light to former leader Frederick Chiluba for him to travel to South Africa where he is expected to receive medical treatment for heart problem.

In the letter delivered by chief government spokesperson Vernon Mwaanga, Mwanawasa said arrangements should be made immediately for Chiluba's evacuation to South Africa to receive medical treatment at government expense.

The president has however instructed that Chiluba should surrender his passport to Zambia's High Commissioner to South Africa upon arrival in that country.

He further noted that Chiluba's wife Regina would not accompany him to South Africa as she was facing criminal charges at home.

Chiluba was supposed to leave for South Africa two weeks ago after the government okayed his trip, which was however suspended later.

Mwaanga, who is also Minister of Information, explained that the suspension of Chiluba's trip was because of the contradictory medical recommendations issued by a local experts team and Chiluba 's doctors in South Africa.

Chiluba however accused that the government was blocking his trip in a bid to fail his health, an accusation denied by the Zambian government.

Chiluba, who ruled Zambia between 1992 and 2001, has been under investigation since 2003 after president Mwanawasa appointed a task force to investigate his theft of 488,000 U.S. dollars public funds during his tenure.

He has previously been denied to go abroad as the government feared that he would not come back to face charges.

Chiluba first left for South Africa for medical treatment in March this year after the Zambian government lifted the ban on his trip abroad.
