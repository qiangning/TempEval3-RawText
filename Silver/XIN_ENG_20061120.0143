Projects and issues regarding the improvement of economic and commercial cooperation among OIC member states will be debated during the meeting, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.

Moreover, second round of the trade negotiations within the context of Framework Agreement Trade Preferential System (TPSOIC) will take place during the meeting, it added.

Ministers of economy from OIC member states as well as observer countries are expected to participate in the meeting, which will be under the chairmanship of Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
