A member of the Palestinian presidential guard was killed and several others injured Sunday in a clash with supporters of the Palestinian ruling party Hamas, medical and security officials said.

A security official said Hamas members tried to storm a southern Gaza training camp for the presidential guard, which Hamas has accused of targeting prime minister Ismail Haniya on Thursday by firing on his convoy.

One of Haniya's bodyguards was killed and one of his sons injured in the crossfire on Thursday.

The security official said one member of the guard was killed in Sunday's clash, which involved automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades.

Witnesses told AFP there were explosions and intense exchanges of gunfire. Hamas officials were not immediately available for comment.

Fatah-backed Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called Saturday for early elections to resolve the political standoff in the Palestinian territories, but Hamas rejected the move as a "coup d'etat".

The Palestinians have been suffering from an aid freeze as the West considers Hamas to be a terrorist organisation. The ruling Islamists have refused to agree to renounce violence, recognise Israel and accept past peace deals.

A Palestinian boy was shot dead and at least 18 others wounded late Saturday as thousands of armed loyalists from both sides, some of them masked, took to the streets of Gaza.
