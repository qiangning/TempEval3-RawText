Doha said on Wednesday it would deliver the the best ever Asian Games.

"I am proud of the phenomenal success the committee has achieved so far in preparations for the Games," Abdulla Khalid Al Qahtani, director general of the Doha Asian Games Organizing Committee (DAGOC), said in a press conference

"We are fulfilling the challenge of hosting the Games with pride and determination while setting an example in the region.

"Our eventual successful hosting the best ever Asian Games becomes more real everyday which is a reflection of the effort and hard work put in by everyone involved."

Qatar is expecting about 10,500 athletes and officials from 45 countries and regions to participate in the 39-event Games, he said, adding that it will be the biggest sporting event in Asia.

International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, who arrived in Doha on Tuesday for a charity event, also showed the confidence with the DAGOC's work.

"The organizing committee has made a fast progress in their preparation and everything is going smoothly," he said.

"I am sure Doha will bring you an excellent Asian Games next year."

According to Al Qahtani, developments across all the programs have been immense and the DAGOC are determined to make Doha 2006 not only a memorable experience for participants and visitors, but to ensure that there is a lasting legacy in the facilities, skills and enthusiasm the nation can contribute to world sport and the region they were proudly a part of.

Until now, several stadiums are under construction, while some are being refurbished, including the Sports City, a key place for the Games which embraced the newly completed Khalifa Stadium, a state-of-the-art 50,000 capacity sporting arena where the opening and closing ceremonies are to be held.

The Games Village, which will become a home away from home for athletes, is expected to be completed by April next year. Most of the venues are 85 percent complete and should be ready by end of this year.

The 2006 Asian Games will begin on December 1 in Doha, thus making Qatar the smallest country in the world's largest continent to host an Asian Games.
