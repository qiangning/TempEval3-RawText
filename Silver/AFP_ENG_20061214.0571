Lin Yue and Wang Xin won the men's and women's 10m platform golds here Thursday, handing China a record clean sweep of all 10 titles at the Asian Games.

Lin, 15, beat teamamte Zhou Luxin into silver with North Korea's Kim Chon Man taking bronze, while Wang, 14, edged compatriot Chen Ruolin and North Korea's Hong In Sun.

It was the first time in the history of the Games that one country has taken all 10 medals. China also won six silver.

"I didn't do very well in the first several dives tonight," said Lin. "I made some small mistakes but in the latter dives I did well.

"I have practised for this for a long time. These are my first Asian Games and I am trying to increase my degrees of difficulty as well as the quality of my dives. I will learn from our former world champions and Olympic champions."

China is a world force in diving and Olympic diving champion Guo Jingjing on Tuesday became the most successful female diver in Asian Games history.

Guo, who has already announced she will retire after the Beijing Olympics, took the women's 3-metre synchronized springboard title here with Li Ting to add to the three golds from previous Asian Games.
