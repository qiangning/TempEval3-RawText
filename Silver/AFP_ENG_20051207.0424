King Gyanendra of Nepal reshuffled his cabinet on Wednesday shortly after returning from a foreign trip during which Maoist rebels and opposition parties lined up against him.

"His Majesty the King has reshuffled the present 22-member Council of Ministers to 35 members," said a statement from the royal palace read out on Nepali television.

The king brought in several new faces and dropped senior ministers including those in charge of the home and finance ministries.

His announcement came days after his return from a three-week trip to Africa and amid growing criticism from opposition parties angered by his failure to restore democracy in the Himalayan kingdom.

Maoist rebels, who have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996, on Friday extended their three-month unilateral ceasefire by one month.

The Maoists and seven mainstream opposition parties agreed last month to form an anti-royal alliance to restore democracy, setting out a 12-point plan and calling for an end to fighting and for elections held under UN auspices.

Under the agreement, the Maoists would lay down their arms under UN or other international supervision while a new constitution was drafted.

Nepal has been shaken by repeated strikes and protests since the king assumed total control in February, a move he justified by saying the government had failed to quell the Maoist revolt.

The violence and the royal takeover has brought international condemnation for both sides as well as reviews of military and humanitarian aid from several countries, including the United States, Britain and India.

The Maoist conflict has killed more than 12,500 people.
