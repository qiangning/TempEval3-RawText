US Defense Secretary William Cohen won assurances from his Japanese counterpart that a special law extending the US military presence in Okinawa would be pass in time for a US-Japan summit in two weeks, a US spokesman said Tuesday.

Cohen, on the first stop of a five-day visit to Japan and Korea, planned to visit US troops at two nearby bases before further meetings later Tuesday with members of the Japanese parliament and Foreign Minister Yukishiko Ikeda.

In an opening round of talks late Monday with Japanese Defense Agency director Fumio Kyuma, Cohen reaffirmed Washington's determination to maintain US troops levels in the Asia-Pacific region at 100,000, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.

Amid protests over the US military presence, landowners in Okinawa have refused to renew leases on US facilities when they expire in May, prompting Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to seek passage of a law to override the landowners.

"They believe that this will pass and this will be done by the time Prime Minister Hashimoto meets President Clinton," Bacon said.

Cohen and Kyuma's talks covered a wide range of issues, including the situation in North Korea and work to update 1978 defense guidelines that would spell out Japan's role in supporting US forces in a crisis in Korea or elsewhere.

"They agreed that the defense guidelines are a serious issue for both sides that we hope to complete to them in September by time of the defense and foreign ministers two-plus-two meeting in Washington in late September," Bacon said.

"The Japanese hoped to give an interim progress report sometime in May on where we stand," Bacon said.

Cohen also raised US interest in involving Japan in developing theater missile defenses, but Bacon said the issue was not a focus of Monday's talks.

The US defense secretary was traveling to the US air base at Yakota and the US navy base at Yokosuka to visit some of the 47,000 US troops in Japan.
