Japan's consul general here called on China Tuesday to be more transparent in its military strategy, and stressed the importance of the US military presence in the region to maintain stability.

Hideaki Ueda called on Beijing to issue defence White Papers in order to make its defence strategy clear.

"We are arguing with the Chinese side to issue defence White Papers to make the issue more transparent. I think they are trying to improve their transparency in this respect," he told a lunch meeting here.

Last November, Ieda's Consulate General was besieged by protesters backing Chinese claims to a Japanese-occupied island chain in the East China Sea.

The dispute over the islands known as Senkaku to the Japanese and Daioyu to the Chinese has been a long-running bone of contention between the Asian giants, and seen by both sides as a potential regional flashpoint.

Ueda defended the US military role in Asia, and specifically Japan, despite a growing chorus of protest back home against US bases there.

The anger at the presence of 47,000 US troops in Japan has been fuelled by the alleged assault on a Japanese woman by a US navy petty officer and the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by US troops in Okinawa in 1995.

The United States wants written assurances that its troops and aircraft will be able to use Japanese facilities and move through the country in the event of a crisis on the Korean peninsula, or other conflicts.

"The US military presence in Asia is a very important factor to stabilise the situation," Ueda said.

"It is Japan's security agreement (with the United States) which is responsible for our security and secondly the security of Asia."

While not mentioning the islands row, Ueda said that possible tension was easily visible in the region; "You only have to look at the Korean peninsula."

He said China was, understandably, modernising her military capacity,

Bilateral,and regional meetings through the ASEAN regional foum and other bodies, were useful for increasing mutual understanding between the regional powers, he added.

"Japan welcomes advances in Sino-US relations, and as Japan sees the US and China as the key to peace in Asia, we all depend on China's emergence as a constructive member of the international community and a continued US military presence," Ueda said.

He voiced confidence over Hong Kong's future under Chinese rule and said Japan urged China and Britian "to work together to achieve the smooth handover that will ensure Hong Kong's future prosperity and stability."

"We are ready to support a Hong Kong governed by Hong Kong people, an autonomous Hong Kong backed by the one country, two systems" policy devised for its future, he added.

Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule in July after more than 150 years as a British colony.
