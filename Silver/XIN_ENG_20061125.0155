Fifteen of the 18 miners are found dead as their bodies have been recovered by 9:38 p.m. Saturday following a colliery gas blast in Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, according to local sources.

Two of the 18 were rescued and rescuers are searching for the one still missing.

The blast took place at 1:50 p.m. Saturday when 32 miners were working in the shaft of the Yuanhua Coal Mine in Jixi City. Fourteen managed to escape.

None of the survivors are in critical condition, though some are injured, according to local sources.

The accident was believed to be caused by gas discharge in the shaft. At 10 a.m. a power failure occurred. When the power is on at about 1 p.m., workers discharged the accumulating gas in a way of violating work regulations.

Further investigation into the cause is underway.

The Yuanhua Coal Mine is privately-owned with an annual production capacity of 30,000 tons.

Jixi is an important coal producing city in China. A gas blast happened there on June 20, 2002 and killed 124 people. The city also saw a gas blast on Sept. 30 this year, when 13 miners were killed.
