China's Ministry of Agriculture said here on Monday that the country now produces more than 100 million doses of bird flu vaccine every day, which can meet the demand in major areas for epidemic prevention and control.

A press release on the ministry's website says the ministry has enhanced the research, manufacture and quality supervision of bird flu vaccine to guarantee supply.

China has the capacity of producing 16 billion doses of bird flu vaccine a year, which can meet the national demand in general, but as the local demand increased recently, some places have reported short supply.

The ministry said it will help accelerate production of the vaccine and expand production capacity. After using new technology, the production cycle has been shortened to 34 days from previous 44 days.

Under the arrangement of the ministry, two more factories have joined in the production of vaccines for water fowls.

The ministry also gave full support to the Harbin Veterinary Institute, which is now researching and developing new types of vaccine of high efficiency.

It is said that such research work is going smoothly, and the new-type vaccine is expected to put into use at the end of this year.

The ministry also enhanced crackdown upon counterfeit vaccines and issued 8.2 million fake-proof labels for this purpose.
