British Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his EU budget deal Saturday that will slash billions of euros from Britain's rebate, saying failure would have caused "immense damage" to its national interest.

Facing a press savaging for renouncing some of the annual cashback in order to strike a deal, he insisted there was no other choice.

"It's in the British interests to stay firmly anchored within the EU, and we've done so successfully during this presidency," he told BBC radio just a few hours after sealing an accord hammered out overnight.

The compromise deal over the 2007-2013 budget followed two days of intense summit diplomacy under Britain's EU presidency, ending a bitter deadlock over the bloc's spending plans.

Britain will effectively give up 10.5 billion euros (12.6 billion dollars) of its long-cherished budget rebate over that period, after an earlier lower proposal was angrily dismissed as inadequate by its EU partners.

Failure to reach a deal "would have done immense damages to the country's national interest," Blair said. "We would have wrecked our entire relationship with these new Europe countries and with the new German government."

The rebate, famously negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 when Britain was struggling economically, is tied to EU spending and rises every year. In 2004 it came to more than five billion euros.

Even after foregoing 10.5 billion euros, the deal would still see Britain's net rebate -- the money it gets back from the bloc -- rise overall during the financial period.

"The rebate rises, it doesn't diminish," Blair said, adding: "Most of the large countries are losing far more than Britain. We have for the first time parity with France."

Blair said the agreement opened the way to a review in 2008 or 2009 of the way the European Union spends its money, claiming "it will then allow us to do changes and to prepare for further reforms."

"I am a reformer," he added. "There's actually a need now for a different type of Europe" and to get rid of "a CAP (common agricultural policy) which is completely out of date."

"We face the possibility of a fundamental reform the next few years," Blair argued.

That was not how the traditionally eurosceptic British press saw it.

"Blair's surrender," lashed the right-wing Daily Mail.

"He gives Europe YOUR cash and is getting NOTHING back," raged the tabloid Sun, Britain's biggest-selling daily, claiming the deal would cost "an extra 100 pounds for every UK man, woman and child."

The conservative Daily Telegraph said Blair "caved in because the EU could not afford another failure" after the acrimonious collapse of an earlier June summit and the rejection by French and Dutch voters of an EU constitution.

"After all the tough talk, surrender was the only option left," it wrote.

Still, The Times, also conservative, detected a silver lining in declaring that Blair had achieved a deal many had thought beyond him and had managed to bring new German Chancellor Angela Merkel closer to his view.

Blair also drew warm praise from a host of other EU leaders for hammering out the deal, some praising his political courage and readiness to compromise at the last minute.

The prime minister insisted Britain's six-month presidency, which ends on December 31, had achieved some solid results.

"We've begun negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, a huge step forward," he told BBC radio, "we've produced a budget, we've got a whole series of changes agreed, often in challenging circumstances."
