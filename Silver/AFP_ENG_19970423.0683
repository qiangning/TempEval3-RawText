The US Air Force on Thursday expressed "sincere regrets" about the alleged assault of a 28-year-old local woman in Okinawa by a US servicemen who has been arrested this week.

Japanese police announced Wednesday that Air Force sergeant Danny Matlock, stationed at the Kadena base on the southern Japanese island, had been arrested for the Monday attack.

"The commander of the 353rd SOG (Special Operations Group) expressed his sincere regrets about this incident," the US Air Force said in a statement.

The statement was issued hours before Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's scheduled departure for the United States, where he will hold a summit with President Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday.

"The Air Force Office of Special Investigations and base officials are assisting in the investigation with the Okinawa City Police," the statement said.

No further details are available, it said, adding: "The incident is still under investigation."

The Jiji Press news agency said he was alleged to have entered the woman's room through a second-floor window and assaulted her but escaped when she screamed.

The rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen triggered anti- US base protests on the island in 1995, leading to a US pledge last year to return some 20 percent of Okinawan land used by the US military.

The US forces in Japan also vowed to tighten discipline among its personnel following the rape.

The southern island prefecture is home to more than half of the 47,000 American troops in Japan and also accounts for about 75 percent of US military facilities on the entire archipelago.

Japanese parliament passed legislation last week allowing the US military to keep using land in Okinawa despite protest from landowners and their supporters.
