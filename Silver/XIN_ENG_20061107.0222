General Motors Corp. said on Tuesday that it had made losses of 91 million U.S. dollars in the July-to-September quarter, 24 million dollars less than previously estimated.

On October 25, the world's biggest automaker reported a loss of 115 million dollars for the third quarter.

"The reduction in net loss is attributable to additional loan sales that had not been previously reported" by its financing arm General Motors Acceptance Corp., the automaker said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The automaker's third quarter loss amounted to 16 cents a share, compared with a loss of 1.66 billion dollars, or 2.94 dollars a share, in the same quarter last year.

For the third quarter, General Motors' revenues totaled 48.89 billion dollars, compared with 47.18 billion dollars a year ago.
