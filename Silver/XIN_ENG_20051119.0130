David Nalbandian came out the first Argentine to reach the final of a year-ending championship for 31 years after the eighth seed beat top Russian Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets here on Saturday in the semifinals of the ATP tennis Masters Cup.

Last time a tennis player from Argentina being a finalist is in 1974 when Guillermo Vilas won the title.

With the victory of 6-0, 7-5 in 1 hour 26 minutes and 43 seconds, Nalbandian set up a final matchup with world number one Roger Federer as the superlative Swiss made short work of his semifinal clash against seventh seed Gaston Gaudio 6-0, 6-0 earlier the night.

The 23-year-old cracked 2 aces, none of double-fault and 21 winners against 13 unforced errors for the win.

Davydenko, who has taken the place of Marat Safin to be the highest ranked Russian in the world and playing on his debut in the season-ending event, had been attempting to become the first Russian reaching the final since Yevgeny Kafelnikov was runner-up at the ATP Tour World Championship in 1997.

The 24-year-old, however, made 29 unforced errors throughout the match though winning 4 aces and 17 winners.

Davydenko, who had made his Masters Cup debut on Monday by defeating all-time great Andre Agassi 6-4, 6-2 in his first round robin match, held a chance of coming back in the middle of the second set when he broke Nalbandian in the sixth game, beating his Argentine opponent to no answers.

But Nalbandian, ranked 12th in the world, soon broke back after the seventh-ranked Davydenko wasted three game points on his own serve.

Again the Argentine made a successful break in the eleventh game before turning two match points into win in the following.
