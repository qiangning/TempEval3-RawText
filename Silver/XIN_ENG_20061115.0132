Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday held talks with visiting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the latest developments in the Palestinian territories and efforts to form a Palestinian national unity government, the official MENA news agency reported.

The two leaders also dealt with efforts to revive the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace track and halt repeated Israeli attacks on the Palestinians, MENA said.

According to Egyptian presidential spokesman Suleiman Awad, Mubarak expressed support to Abbas as leader of the Palestinian National Authority and support for efforts to form a Palestinian national unity government and revive the peace march.

Mubarak said that Egypt hoped the coming period would witness the formation of a Palestinian national unity which will help reactivate the peace process and end sufferings of the Palestinians, according to Awad.

Abbas arrived in Cairo on Tuesday to brief Mubarak on the latest developments of the ongoing consultations to form such a government, the spokesman said.

Palestinian officials said that Abbas' Fatah movement has reached an initial deal with the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas) on portfolios of a new coalition government.

Broader talks among all Palestinian factions on forming a national unity government are expected to start early next week.

Hamas, bent on Israel's destruction, formed a government in late March. But a boycott by Israel, Europe and the United States has caused political and economic crises in the Palestinian territories.
