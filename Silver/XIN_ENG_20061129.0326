The team competition schedule of badminton at the Doha Asian Games was fixed here on Wednesday, just one day before the beginning of the events.

Arccording to chief umpire Moham Dharan, the schedule was changed in demands of some teams who were not satisfied with playing twice a day.

"The schedule has been decided already. We don't call it a ' problem' but an 'issue'. All was right in format," said Dharan.

Since there must be a team in each group playing twice a day, the final schedule sets the team lowest in rankings in each group to "suffer" it. "They have to accept it," said Dharan, who refused to call those teams the weakest but the "third teams".

In men's team event, India, Vietnam and Japan are slated to play twice in Nov. 30. Indonesia, Singapore and Chinese Taipei are pitted against two rivals each in Dec. 2.
