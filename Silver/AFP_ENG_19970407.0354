Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng thanked French President Jacques Chirac Monday for not supporting a European Union move to censure China over its human rights record.

Jiang told reporters the decision by Paris not to support an EU motion to criticize China's human rights record at the ongoing UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva was "very good."

Li told visiting French Defense Minister Charles Million that "we appreciate this perceptive and intelligent decision" by Chirac, state television reported.

He added that China was "happy to cooperate and arrange exchanges with France" in the area of defence and promoting human rights.

"In the past year, we have been happy to see that in bilateral and international fields, France and China have made great progress and in a positive direction," Li told Millon at the start of their meeting.

"We greatly appreciate the importance placed on Franco-Chinese relations by Chirac," he said, adding Beijing was looking forward to Chirac's visit in May."

Millon's five-day visit, which started Sunday, is a clear indication that Paris wants to open a new chapter of ties with Beijing.

During his visit, the first to China by a French defence minister since Paris and Beijing established diplomatic relations in 1964, Millon has invited Chinese defence officials to study in France and called for more visits from the Chinese navy.

Millon's landmark visit is one of the highest-level French visits since the PLA stormed Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 and fired on unarmed demonstrators, killing hundreds.

European Union foreign ministers agreed Monday to go ahead with UN resolutions criticising the human rights record of Burma, Zaire, Iraq and Iran despite failing to reach accord on a similar condemnation of China.

The move overcame a standoff when the EU's Dutch presidency threatened not to table any resolutions at the UN's Human Rights Commission's annual meeting in Geneva after France blocked a common EU stance on China.

The EU has jointly sponsored a resolution critical of China in Geneva every year since 1989.

France's stance that it is better to pursue a dialogue with China than to seek confrontation is supported by Germany, Italy and Spain but these three countries were willing to go along with the resolution in the name of EU unity if Paris lifted its veto.

Human rights groups believe France's stance on the resolution is motivated by a concern not to jeopardise a major contract for Airbus planes that Chirac is expected to clinch when he visits Beijing.
