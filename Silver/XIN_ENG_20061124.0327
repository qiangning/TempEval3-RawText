China started a nationwide examination on Saturday to recruit civil servant for the Central Government in 2007, with 42 people competing for each job on average.

The exam is held simultaneously in 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions nationwide where more than 530,000 people will compete for about 12,700 jobs, said a spokesman of the Ministry of Personnel, the exam organizer.

The ministry said the exam includes two sessions, with the administrative aptitude test (AAT) in the morning and the essay test in the afternoon, according to the exam schedule.

Since 1994, China has organized 13 consecutive civil servant recruitment examinations for departments of the central authorities and regional units of these departments.
