The chief of Japan's scandal-hit state-run nuclear plant operator said Tuesday it planned to privatise its uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel reprocessing operations following a series of accidents.

Toshiyuki Kondo, president of Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen), announced the plan during the House of Councillors Budget Committee.

Kondo said the plan was part of its restructuring scheme following the emergence of a scandal sparked by a string of nuclear leaks which officials kept secret.

"We are thinking of transferring our uranium enrichment operation to Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd.," Kondo said. Japan Nuclear Fuel is a private entity owned mainly by Japan's nine major electric power companies.

Kondo also said Donen planned to transfer its nuclear fuel reprocessing functions now undertaken at a reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, into private hands.

Kyodo News said the uranium enrichment and nuclear reprocessing operations were Donen's main functions, making it likely their transfer to the private sector would strengthen the argument that Donen be dissolved.

But the president denied the possibility of the complete disbandment of Donen, saying the state-run nuclear operator must continue its research into nuclear fuel cycle technology based on fast-breeder reactors and disposal of highly radioactive waste.

"Private entities cannot handle the two operations because they will cost a lot of time and money," Kondo said. "Therefore, the country would continue undertaking these two operations."

Last week, a special commission headed by Riichiro Chikaoka, minister in charge of the science and technology agency, began talks on measures to reform Donen.

Calls for revamping Donen mounted after a fire and explosion at its nuclear reprocessing plant in Tokai, northeast of Tokyo, which came 15 months after a massive sodium leak at its fast-breeder Monju reactor in the western city of Tsuruga.

The March 11 accident exposed 37 workers to low-level radiation and is considered to be Japan's worst nuclear accident.

Donen faced another crisis as heavy water leaked at the Fugen advanced thermal converter reactor in Tsuruga, boosting the air density of radioactive tritium to 18 times the normal level and leaving 11 workers exposed to low-level radiation.

The nuclear power plant operator has also come under fire for covering up incidents at Monju and Tokai.

Donen admitted last week that it had also failed to report "11 very low levels of leaks" at Fugen in the past three years.

Earlier in the day, the lower house voted to kill an opposition- sponsored no-confidence motion against the science and technology agency chief Chikaoka over the incidents involving Donen.
