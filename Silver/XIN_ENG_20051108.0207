Senior Palestinian officials on Tuesday slammed an Israeli call to suspend activities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in the Gaza Strip.

Hatem Abdel Qader, a Palestinian legislator, told reporters that Israel attempts to end the UNRWA's mandate to remove the issue of refugees and their right of return.

He said the international community should pay close attention to the issue of Palestinian refugees and work to alleviate their sufferings.

Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom called on the UNRWA to transfer its mandate to the Palestinian National Authority and end its activities in the Gaza Strip.

Meanwhile, Sami Mushasha, a spokesperson for the UNRWA in Jerusalem, said Shalom's request was a personal one and the UNRWA has rejected his request.
