Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ahmed El-Ganzoury arrived here Tuesday for a three-day official visit to Singapore to boost political and economic ties, officials said.

Kamal, who flew here from neighbouring Malaysia where he was on a three-day visit, was received on arrival in rainy weather by his Singaporean counterpart Goh Chok Tong.

A ceremonial welcome for the Egyptian visitor was held under a shelter in front of the Changi airport's VIP complex where he inspected a guard of honour.

Goh will host a dinner for Kamal later Tuesday.

Kamal would on Wednesday attend briefings on Singapore's successful public transport, housing and port development systems and hold talks with President Ong Teng Cheong and former premier Lee Kuan Yew.

On Thursday, he would be briefed on Singapore's pension scheme at the Central Provident Fund office and visit the Trade Development Board before leaving for China on the last leg of his Asian tour.
