Australians were Sunday coming to terms with drawing champions Brazil in the 2006 World Cup finals, with press reports upbeat that the Socceroos could match the favourites.

Under a frontpage headline of 'We're ready to do battle', The Sunday Telegraph quoted star striker Harry Kewell as saying the Socceroos were excited about the prospect of playing.

"I'm not fussed about who we are playing. We're just looking forward to it," the Liverpool player told the paper.

"Look what happened at the last World Cup with the top countries like France and Argentina. They were knocked out in the first round.

"Look what Greece did when they won the Euro (European Championship) in 2004. No one gave them a chance."

But a photograph of soccer fans watching the draw live early Saturday morning Sydney time published in The Sun-Herald told a different story -- all pictured had their heads in their hands or looks of anguish on their faces.

"It's not the 'group of death.' But it feels like it," soccer journalist Michael Cockerill wrote in the same paper.

"Brazil, the best team in the world. Croatia, the most motivated team in the world. And Japan, the best resourced," he wrote in describing Australia's companions in Group F.

But while Brazil were certain to win the group, Australia had the benefit of having beaten all three teams previously, and Brazil had gone down 1-0 at the 2001 Confederations Cup in South Korea, he said.

The optimism was backed by Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer who, in an article published in The Sun-Herald, said the Socceroos would go into the World Cup believing they were world-beaters.

"Playing Brazil in the World Cup is going to be massive," he wrote in a column for the paper. "They are justifiably rated No. 1 in the world, but anything is possible in the World Cup.

"Even though people might say we are crazy and have no chance of beating Brazil, I think that if we don't hold that belief and that mentality before we play then there is something wrong."

The Australians, who are ranked 49th in the world, also won some support from an unusual quarter with Brazilian legend Pele telling The Sun-Herald that Australia could pose a threat to the boys from Brazil.

Asked if Australia had a chance of beating Brazil in their group match in Munich, Pele replied: "I think yes. They beat Uruguay, so why not?"

But he added: "I think it will be a little bit different here though."

The Socceroos earned their first spot at the World Cup in 32 years in November when they beat Uruguay in a dramatic 4-2 penalty shoot-out win after extra time.
