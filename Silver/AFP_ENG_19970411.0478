A Spanish businessman charged with illegally exporting US food products to Cuba pleaded not guilty at a hearing here Friday.

The United States has accused Javier Ferreiro -- a resident of Cuba -- of selling US products in Havana via the Dominicna Republic and Panama between March 1994 and January 1996.

Ferreiro has said he bought the US goods directly in the Dominican Republic not the United States, which would free him from the charges.

The charges against Ferreiro, 49, include five counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy and eight counts of "trading with the enemy" under the embargo Washington has had clamped on Cuba since 1963.

Among the goods Ferreiro allegedly exported were disposible diapers (nappies), mustard and ketchup.

He was detained April 1 on a visit here to friends and relatives.
