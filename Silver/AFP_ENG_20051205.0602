US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Monday condemned a suicide bombing in which five Israelis were killed and called on Palestinians to "deal with the terrorist organizations" in their midst.

"This kind of terrorist attack has to be condemned and condemned thoroughly," Rice said aboard the plane bringing her to Berlin, where she began a five-day European tour. "The Palestinian Authority has done so."

"We call upon the Palestinians to fight terror and to begin to deal with the terrorist organisations that are in their midst," she said. "Because clearly they are terrorist organisations who do not intend to be a part of a national consensus, but rather intend to continue to kill innocent people."

She said the blast at a shopping mall in the northern Israeli coastal town of Netanya was the work of "people who wish to arrest the potential progress for peace that Israel and the Palestinians are trying to make."

In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli noted that responsibility for the attack was was claimed by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which has its offices in Syria and has been behind all suicide bombings since armed Palestinian factions signed a truce in March.

"So if anybody needed a reminder, this is it, that the Syrian government should take immediate steps to crack down on this group and to inhibit its activities by shutting down Islamic Jihad offices and expelling its personnel," Ereli said.
