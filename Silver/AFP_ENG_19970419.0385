Fuji Electric Co. Ltd., Kawasaki Steel Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. have jointly developed a universal intermediate semiconductor aimed at helping connect factory automation equipment, a newspaper said Sunday.

The three companies said introduction of the new application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) would lead to a cut in production costs by simplifying connections in factory automation systems, Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.

The new chip incorporates a central processing unit and a memory device to transmit input and output signals and data among factory automation equipment.

The newly developed integrated circuit is designed to enable connections among robots, numerically-controlled machine tools and sensors, the paper said.

The daily said the three Japanese companies would introduce the semiconductor, which could be used to link automated factory equipment regardless of its manufacturer, to their factories.

The firms would also sell the chip to other companies, it said.

Nissan was in charge of providing technology for connecting factory automation equipment and conducted tests, while Kawasaki Steel provided chip technology, with Fuji Electric developing software for the project.

Kawasaki will produce the ASIC with plans to begin a sample shipment in June and supply 1.3 million units annually by 2000.

Fuji will develop and sell ASIC-equipped factory automation equipment.

Nihon Keizai said that use of the semiconductor was likely to standardize factory automation equipment connections and lead to improvement in productivity.
