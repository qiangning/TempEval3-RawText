The United States expressed outrage Monday at the murder of an anti-Syrian newspaper chief in Lebanon and called it an "act of terrorism" aimed at perpetuating Damascus' dominance of its neighbor.

Washington said the car bomb that killed Gibran Tueni highlighted the need to enforce UN demands that Syria stop interfering in Lebanon and cooperate in the probe of February's killing of former Lebanese premier Rafiq Hariri.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement she was "outraged" by the assassination of Tueni, which she called "a vicious act of terror against a Lebanese patriot and a voice of freedom."

"Together we in the international community will confront and defeat those who seek to terrorize and subjugate a proud, independent Lebanon," Rice said.   "Syrian interference in Lebanon continues, and it must end completely," Rice added.

US officials said it was too early to pin the powerful bomb that killed Tueni, a newly elected member of parliament, and three other people in a Beirut suburb directly on Syria.

But they expressed little doubt about the motive.

"I think that his murder is another act of terrorism aimed at trying to subjugate Lebanon to Syrian domination," White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters accompanying President George W. Bush to Philadelphia.

"It's clear this savage attack is clearly intended to intimidate those in Lebanon who would courageously and openly speak their minds," McClellan said. "It's also a violent and direct assault on freedom of press in Lebanon.

"The attack is a reminder that all of us in the international community must continue to insist on enforcing the Security Council resolutions aimed at ending Syria's interference in Lebanon once and for all."

The bombing followed the handover of a report by UN chief investigator Detlev Mehlis to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on his probe into the murder of Hariri, an attack blamed on Syria.

The State Department would not say whether the United States supported a call by the Lebanese government for a similar UN inquiry into the Tueni killing as well as the murders of other Syrian opponents in Lebanon.

"We will certainly look at that idea, work with the people of Lebanon, the government of Lebanon and all those who want to see accountability for this crime and for past crimes," said deputy spokesman Adam Ereli.

He said Rice discussed the Tueni killing Monday by phone with Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy of France, which has helped Washington spearhead the move to end Syrian influence in Lebanon.

"The secretary and Douste-Blazy discussed the importance of accountability for this crime (and) continued support for the Mehlis investigation," Ereli told reporters at the State Department.

"We will continue to work with the French and others, and the Lebanese, in order to make sure that not only do we know what happened to Mr. Tueni, but that we all act effectively to preserve Lebanese sovereignty and independence."

But US officials said they were still discussing whether to expand the scope of the Mehlis probe to include the other killings, perhaps set up a new body or come up with some other solution.

"The modalities of that are going to be a point of discussion with us, with the Lebanese, with the Security Council," Ereli said.
