Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Mahmood Kasuri would pay an official visit to Afghan capital Kabul early next month, Afghanistan's Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta said Tuesday.

"His Excellency Mr. Kasuri is going to visit Kabul from 7th to 9th December," Spanta told newsmen here.

The agenda of his talks with Afghan officials would cover holding the peace Jirga or grand assembly, and boosting bilateral cooperation in all fields including the war on terror, he added.

President Hamid Karzai and his Pakistani counterpart Pervez Musharaf reached an agreement in front of U.S. President Bush to hold a grand assembly of the elders and chieftains of the two neighboring countries in order to find a viable solution to militancy.
