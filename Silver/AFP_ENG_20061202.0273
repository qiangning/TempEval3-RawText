Li Du of China won the women's 10m Air Rifle individual title at the Asian Games with a combined qualification and final tally of 501.4 points here on Saturday

Zhao Yinghui of China came second and team-mate Wu Liuxi was third, but the bronze was awarded to fourth-placed Olga Dovgun of Kazakhstan because Asian Games shooting rules stipulate that only two athletes from one country can win medals in one event.

China won all six gold medals on offer on the opening day of competition at the Lusail ranges.
