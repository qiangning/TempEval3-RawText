The Bulgarian battalion in Iraq will begin its withdrawal right after Iraqi parliamentary elections planned for Dec. 15, the press office of the Bulgarian Defense Ministry has announced.

The office released a piece of news that the country's Defense Minister Vesselin Bliznakov had sent a letter to the allies in " Central-South" Iraq under Polish command thus officially informing them of Sofia's plans for withdrawal.

In the letter Minister Bliznakov also informed the partners that the Bulgarian Parliament has authorized Council of Ministers to negotiate the "appropriate forms" in future participation in the coalition under the UN solutions and EU and US position on Iraq.

The biggest local newspaper "TRUD" revealed earlier that the Bulgarian government is planning to resend to Iraq a team of 300 soldiers for non-military task.

The National Assembly (Parliament) of Bulgaria approved in May a government plan to withdraw the country's 400 troops in Diwaniya, Iraq by the end of the year after a long mandate of more than 2 years. Thirteen Bulgarian soldiers have already died there by now.
