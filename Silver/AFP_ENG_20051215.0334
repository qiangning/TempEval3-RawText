Iraqis polls closed Thursday following a landmark poll to choose a government many hope will restore stability to a nation wracked by violence and sectarian feuding since the fall of Saddam Hussein.

Despite a massive security lockdown, three men died in attacks north of Baghdad while mortar strikes in the capital, including one in the fortified Green Zone claimed by an Al-Qaeda-linked group, wounded four civilians and a US marine.

"The most important thing is for Iraqis to express themselves with ballots, not blasts," Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari said.

Reacting to one blast in Baghdad, Shiite voter Safia Mohammed said: "This is our day of victory, they will not drive us back to our homes, this is the end of terrorism."

Voters went to the polls in large numbers, including Sunni Arabs who had snubbed an election in January.

"Turnout was very strong in all regions, even in Fallujah," a Sunni city in the western Al-Anbar province, senior electoral commission member Hussein al-Hindawi told AFP, without giving details.

Strict security measures brought Iraq to a halt as 15.5 million Iraqis were called to vote for a four-year, 275-member parliament, with top candidates pledging to restore stability and pave the way for an exit of foreign troops.

"It's a national celebration for all Iraqis," declared President Jalal Talabani, the country's first Kurdish head of state.

US President George W. Bush said Iraqi democracy would serve as a "model" for the Middle East, while US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and three US senators symbolically dipped their fingers in ink used to identify Iraqi voters.

The vote, the third this year, marks a new start following the US-led invasion in March 2003 to oust Saddam, two transitional governments and the adoption of a constitution in October.

Iraqis poured into the streets and walked to polling stations because of a vehicle ban aimed at curbing car bomb attacks.

In the capital and in Fallujah, disabled men in wheelchairs and on crutches joined neighbours to cast their ballots, with many demanding stability and the restoration of public services such as electricity and water.

In the holy city of Najaf, as well as the main southern city of Basra, residents did not wait to celebrate victory for the dominant religious Shiite group, the United Iraqi Alliance.

A total of 7,655 candidates and 307 political entities, nearly triple the number that stood in January, competed for office.

A rare glitch was reported in Fallujah, where some polling stations ran out of ballots following a higher-than-expected turnout.

"The participation of the people so far is very good, it was unexpected," city council president Sheikh Kamal Shakur said.

Vice President Adel Abdel Mehdi, tipped by many as the next prime minister, had forecast earlier that "the next parliament will represent all Iraqis."

Ministers praised a security plan designed to thwart suicide attacks that killed almost 40 people during January's election, Iraq's first free vote in half a century.

The leading secular Shiite candidate, former prime minister Iyad Allawi, complained however that his supporters had been attacked and killed during the campaign.

Top British general Nick Houghton told the BBC that the election gave London "growing confidence" that a transition of security powers, allowing foreign troops to leave Iraq, would begin in the first half of 2006.

In Rome, Defense Minister Antonio Martino announced that Italy would withdraw an additional 300 soldiers from Iraq in January.

Around 2,154 US soldiers have been killed since the 2003 invasion, which Bush admitted Wednesday had been based on wrong intelligence. Bush has estimated that 30,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed.

Adjourned for the election, Saddam's trial on charges of crimes against humanity threatened to exacerbate already high ethnic tensions in the country.

Following purported Al-Qaeda threats to "ruin the 'democratic' wedding", virtually all Iraq's 190,000 police and army were mobilized, with US-led troops providing perimeter security for voting stations.

Civilians were banned from carrying weapons and driving to polling stations that opened at 7:00 am (0400 GMT) and closed at 5:00 pm.

Shiites and Kurds who dominated the transitional administration expected a full-term parliament to cement their grip on power after decades of oppression.

The Sunni minority was keen to prevent a government dominated by religious Shiites and a break-up of Iraq into autonomous Kurdish and Shiite zones.

The new parliament's first task will be to appoint a president and two vice presidents. The presidential council will then have 15 days to name a prime minister, who has 30 days to form a cabinet with parliamentary approval.

On Tuesday, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Richard Lugar warned however that an operational government might not be finalised until April.
