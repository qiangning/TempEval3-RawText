Visiting former Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, said on Tuesday world safety has worsened judging by the increasing number of bombings and terrorist cases across the globe.

Mohamad said this in an interview with reporters soon after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe at State House.

"The world is still not safe today, in fact it is getting worse. For example, travelers are no longer safe because of terrorism while in different places such as America, bombings continue to occur."

He condemned the unipolar world now existing in world politics, saying it was an unfortunate phenomenon that other countries in the world could not tackle.

"It's a bad thing that is happening but unfortunately we can not opt for the other side," he said.

Meanwhile he described Zimbabwe as a rich nation with great potential for development.

He also spoke out in support of the government's land reform program that has seen thousands of landless blacks being given land.

"Zimbabwe is now independent and the whites should know that what they had during the colonial period, they cannot have now," he said.

He will leave Zimbabwe on Wednesday after a three-day official visit for Lesotho to attend the Southern African International Dialogue (SAID), a forum established to discuss various issues affecting the region and the way forward.

Mahathir retired as the Malaysian prime minister in October, 2003 after 22 years at the helm and was replaced by Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.

Since retirement, he has spent most of his time traveling and delivering speeches.
