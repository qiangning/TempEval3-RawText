South Africa, India and Brazil have agreed to enhance their cooperation on tax and customs to boost trade and economic development in the countries, South African Revenue Services (SARS) said on Tuesday.

India's revenue secretary, Brazil's federal revenue secretary and SARS Commissioner Pravin Gordhan signed the joint declaration in Pretoria on Tuesday, committing their organizations to closer ties across a wide range of areas on both the revenue and customs fronts, the SAPA news agency reported.

"The move also seeks to thwart smuggling, drug trafficking, fraud and tax avoidance in the three nations," said Logan Wort, a SARS spokesman.

Central to the declaration was an agreement to exchange information between the three revenue authorities to help identify high-risk transactions and speed up the processing of imports and exports. The officials also agreed to share information on tax, the SAPA said.

"Where appropriate, they agreed to perform simultaneous tax audits on common business entities," said Wort.

Another area for further cooperation will be working together to develop common positions for trade facilitation negotiations.

The declaration was part of outcomes of a three-day inaugural meeting of the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Heads of Revenue Administrations.

The meeting was conducted under the auspices of the IBSA Dialogue Forum established between the three countries to further economic cooperation, following the first IBSA heads of government summit in Brazil in September.

The heads of revenue administrations also agreed to establish an IBSA Revenue Administration Working Group to further expedite links between their organizations.

Trade between South Africa, Brazil and India had risen sharply over the past few years and was expected to grow even more significantly once a formal trade agreement was in place between the IBSA partners, said Wort.

Trade between Brazil and South Africa rose to more than 10 billion rand (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) in 2005 from 6.6 billion rand (0.9 billion dollars ) two years earlier.

Between India and South Africa the trade totaled more than 14 billion rand (1.96 billion U.S. dollars) last year, more than doubling that of 2003, Wort said.
