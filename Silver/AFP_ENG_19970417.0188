Thailand's cabinet Thursday approved a draft budget for the next fiscal year to September 1998 worth 1,008 billion baht (38.7 billion dollars), a Budget Bureau official said.

The figure was up nine percent on the current year's budget of 925 billion baht and only 2.4 percent on the original allocation for fiscal 1997, from which the cabinet approved cuts of 59 billion baht last month.

Investment expenditure accounted for 39 percent of the total fiscal 1998 budget, down from 42 percent a year earlier, the official said.

Ministries will have to submit final spending plans to the cabinet for reconsideration on May 21, he said.

Transport and Communications Minister Suwat Lippatapallop said his ministry had been given a 1998 budget of 100 billion baht, up 25 percent from the current fiscal year.

The ministry is responsible for the Highways Department and several telecommunications projects.

Budget Bureau director Seree Sukstaporn said earlier that stable inflation was forecast at around five percent in 1998, while the country's gross domestic product was expected to rise 6.7 to 6.8 percent to around five trillion baht.
