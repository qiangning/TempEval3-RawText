English Championship strugglers Leeds on Saturday admitted they broke Football League regulations by fielding six loan players in last month's defeat at Burnley.

Leeds boss Dennis Wise selected Graham Stack, Matt Heath, Ugo Ehiogu, Tresor Kandol and Geoff Horsfield for the 2-1 defeat at Turf Moor on November 28, while Tony Warner was an unused substitute.

The Football League rulebook says that only five players on loan from other clubs can be named in a team's squad for any match.

A statement on Leeds's website said: "We can confirm that the club broke Football League regulations at Burnley.

"We will co-operate fully with the Football League on this matter and explain the extenuating circumstances."
