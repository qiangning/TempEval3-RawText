Venezuelan Vice President Jose Vecente Rangel said Tuesday that Sunday's congressional elections will go ahead despite boycott from three opposition parties, saying the opposition's withdrawal was "good."

"The opposition says this election isn't clean. It's the cleanest in Venezuela's history, but they have interests opposed to the National Electoral Council," Rangel told local press. "The Democratic Action party has withdrawn... very good! "

Rangal's remarks came after three opposition parties -- the Democratic Action, the Project Venezuela and the Social Christian Party, or Copei, announced their pulling out from the elections.

The opposition said the National Electoral Council favored the ruling party candidates and has failed to correct the errors in the voter registry.

"Imagine what it means for a party like Democratic Action to say that today...under these conditions, we cannot participate in the electoral process, " said Henry Ramos of the Democratic Action, the largest opposition party in the country.

Polling firms said the ruling Fifth Republic Movement of President Hugo Chavez will win a sweeping victory in Sunday's elections. If the ruling party reaches its goal of getting a two-thirds majority, it can begin to make constitutional reforms.

Analysts said one of the possible reforms might be lifting the restriction limiting presidents to two six-year terms. Chavez's term will not expire until 2012 if he is re-elected next year.

Venezuela's opposition parties, including the three parties that boycotted the upcoming elections, now hold a total of 79 seats in the 165-seat National Assembly, while the rest 86 seats are taken by pro-Chavez lawmakers.

Sunday's election will be the first time when both Democratic Action and Copei have no candidates since 1958 -- when Venezuela's last military dictatorship ended. Venezuelans will elect 167 deputies to the National Assembly for five-year terms.
