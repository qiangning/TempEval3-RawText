New Zealand is set to adopt the International Convention Against Doping in Sport as part of its commitment to eliminating the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport, a minister announced on Tuesday.

The convention was tabled in Parliament Wednesday and it is hoped that New Zealand will become a party to the international agreement before the end of the year.

"New Zealand is recognized internationally as a world leader in the fight against the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport and being party to this convention reflects our strong and unwavering commitment in this area," said Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard.

He said the use of doping in sport is a major challenge to the international sporting community, and threatens everything we respect and value in sport - honesty, ethics, fairness, health, respect, and courage.

Parties to the convention commit to implementing measures consistent with the World Anti-Doping Code, which harmonises anti-doping policy and practice and provides standards in areas such as testing programs, sanctions, appeals and laboratory practices.

They must also adopt measures, where appropriate, to restrict the availability of prohibited substances by tackling their production, movement, importation, distribution, sale and trafficking.

It is hoped that the convention will be in force by the time of the February 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. This will require that at least 30 countries join before the end of December 2005.
