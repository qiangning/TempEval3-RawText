Iran has for the first time approved a non-cleric to run for the key body that supervises and selects the supreme leader, although he remains a pillar of the Islamic republic's establishment.

Mohsen Esmaili, a 41-year-old law professor, is a member of the conservative electoral watchdog the Guardians Council that vetted 495 candidates for December 15 poll, disqualifying two-thirds of them.

Esmaili, as well as an unspecified number of candidates, had to take an exam to ascertain whether he was sufficiently qualified in Islamic jurisprudence to be termed "mojtahed" and thus qualify to serve in the Assembly of Experts.

The Iranian constitution does not require candidates to be a "mojtahed", but the body, which has autonomy in tailoring requirements for membership, has made that mandatory.

Esmaili believes the Assembly needs to open its doors to non-clerical experts in politics, the economy, international law and administration to play a more effective role as an advisor to the leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

"Those who enter the Assembly of Experts should be able to understand the complicated issues of modern world and present solutions to the leader and the policy-making bodies," he told a press conference, dressed in a smart three-piece suit.

"The leader has shown he is willing to hear different views," Esmaili said, adding he would seek to boost links between non-clerical consultants and the Assembly members if elected.

"We have more accurate information about people's needs because of our presence in universities," said Esmaili, who has formed a coalition with five other candidates in Tehran, and is working to have 40 other candidates representing 20 provinces join the group.

Several non-clerical figures, most notably President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and parliament speaker Gholam Ali Hadad-Adel, have won key posts in recent years, in a change of the trend that prevailed the late 1980s and 1990s.

However the term non-cleric is not synonymous with reformist and both Ahmadinejad and Hadad-Adel are conservatives seen as close to the supreme leader.

Himself a former student of Khamenei, Esmaili said "of course we see the leader as the best person for navigating Iran through the turbulence of today's world but it does not mean that nobody has the right to comment or criticize."

The 86-member Assembly -- which is only elected once every eight years -- is in charge of supervising, dismissing and electing the Supreme Leader, who is appointed for life.

Esmaili stopped short of commenting on the Assembly's past record as it "has not published an official report, so we cannot judge". The Assembly does not publish details of its discussions, only its opening and closing statements.

He believes the Assembly, which meets twice a year, should be more transparent, providing the public with regular reports of its decisions and activities.

"We will take a step forward. The sessions should be open unless the law prevents making something public to protect national interests".

Esmaili expressed regret that some clerical hopefuls snubbed the Islamic jurisprudence exam in the run-up to the election and consequently were excluded from the race.

"We should submit to the instruments of democracy. When there is a condition we should use it," he said of those who regarded the prerequisite as an insult.

Among those who boycotted the test were leading reformist clerics Majid Ansari, who is an incumbent member of the Assembly, and Hadi Khamenei, brother of the supreme leader.

"We should have members representing different views, but the ones who put national interests before personal leanings," he said.

"It's our duty to prove a theocracy is efficient and capable of responding to modern questions."
