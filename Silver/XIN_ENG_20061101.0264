Bulgaria would inform the European Union of an electricity shortage in the Balkan region due to its nuclear power plant shutdown, the BTA newa agency reported on Wednesday.

Bulgarian Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharovis told the Southeast Europe Economic Forum that Bulgaria was expected to inform the European Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs of the decommissioning of units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.

Bulgaria asked the European Commission (EC) to take actions to guarantee electricity supply in the region, "as we will not be able to do it any more," the minister said.

The Kozloduy plant the biggest plant on the Balkan Peninsula, is used to generate power for the region. However, the EC had showed concerns about the security of the facility, since part of the units in Kozloduy were of the same type of those in Ukraine's Chernobyl plant, which witnessed the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.

As part of the criteria for Bulgaria's bid for entering the European Union, Bulgaria has already shut down units 1 and 2 in Kozloduy in 2003, and is to shut the other two units by the end of the year.

Also due to delayed deliveries of coal for some thermal plants, Bulgaria's electricity exports for the Balkan Peninsula would be ceased to secure the local electricity supply, the minister said, adding that the EC had promised to do its best to plug the power shortfall in the region.

Currently, Bulgaria's National Electricity Company has received requests for electricity supply from Kosovo, a Serbian province which is currently under international administration, Greece and Macedonia, but tenders for electricity exports to Greece and Kosovo in 2007 had been turned down, the minister said.
