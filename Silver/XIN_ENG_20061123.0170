Indonesia and Russia will sign an agreement on military cooperation during Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's visit to Russia on Nov. 29, a spokesman said here Thursday.

"The memorandum of understanding to be signed will cover military cooperation for 2006-2010 and the war on terrorism," presidential spokesman Dino Patti Djalal told the press when announcing the president's planned four-day visit to Russia.

Dino said, on his way to Russia, the president will visit Tokyo on Nov. 26 at the invitation of Japanese Emperor Akihito. The visit to Japan is primarily aimed at stepping up bilateral economic cooperation, including efforts to increase economic cooperation, cooperation to fight bird flu and a discussion on development of the United Nations Security Council.

In Tokyo, Susilo is expected to meet new Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Yudhoyono will be the first head of state to be received by Abe since he assumed the Japanese premiership.

During staying in Moscow, Susilo will hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 1, 2006.
