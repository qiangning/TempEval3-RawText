Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas sparked hope for the stalled Middle East peace process Sunday by meeting for the first time in six months, but observers warned against expecting too much from the encounter.

The two leaders met at Olmert's residence in Jerusalem late Saturday, kissing and warmly shaking hands after a two-hour dinner followed by one-on-one talks.

"The two leaders expressed their will to cooperate, as true partners, in an effort to advance the peace process" and reiterated support for reaching "a solution of two states living side by side in peace and security," Olmert's office said in a statement late Saturday.

The two leaders' long-awaited encounter -- their first since an informal meeting in Jordan in late June -- sparked hope that the peace process could be nudged from the slumber in which it has been for the past six years.

"Our intention is to begin ongoing negotiations in order to advance the peace process that we want so much," Olmert said Sunday at the opening of a weekly cabinet meeting.

In a phone call with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also on Sunday, Olmert said his meeting with Abbas "could mark an opening for a better future," his office said.

"The ice has been broken," Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said. The meeting "again opened the way to negotiations."

But while Israeli officials played up the importance of the encounter, observers on both sides said it lacked in concrete measures and warned against inflated expectations.

"It was a first step, but we won't know if it's important before we see the results on the ground," Ali al-Jarbawi, a political science professor at the Birzeit University in Ramallah, told AFP. "The Palestinian people are looking for results, not meetings."

As part of the measures agreed on during the encounter the Israeli cabinet voted unanimously Sunday to release up to 100 million dollars in customs duties that it has been withholding from the Palestinian Authority since the Islamist Hamas movement formed a cabinet in March.

Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the West, which froze all direct aid to the Palestinian government after it took power.

Observers said that the meeting was meant to strengthen Abbas at a time when he is facing off against Hamas in an intense power struggle, which boiled over into deadly armed clashes last week between rival Palestinian factions after the Palestinian president called for early elections.

Olmert said Sunday that he agreed to release the money "in order to help in humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people who suffer among other things due to the failing conduct of their government which is not part of the international community."

The United Arab Emirates is to transfer 30 million dollars to the Palestinian Authority "to help reduce the suffering of the Palestinian people," the official WAM news agency said.

But Israel did not agree to release prisoners -- an important gesture sought by Abbas.

"Olmert did not give Abu Mazen anything real," said Khani al-Masri, an analyst in Ramallah.

Wrote the Israeli newspaper Maariv: "The biggest achievement of Abu Mazen yesterday at the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem lay in the Palestinian flag that was raised in his honor above the entrance."

"He received a lot of promises and a little money... The only asset that Abu Mazen can broadcast to his people today is a little optimism."

Hamas likewise said the encounter did not amount to anything concrete.

"This meeting was meant to throw sand in our eyes... an exercise in public relations," said Wasfi Kabha, the Hamas minister for prisoner affairs. "Both Abu Mazen and Olmert are facing internal crises and they held this meeting just to say there is hope to resume the negotiations."

And the radical Islamic Jihad group said in a statement that it was a waste of time that "is not helping the Palestinian interests."
