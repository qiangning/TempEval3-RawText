Tati, the distinctly downmarket Paris department store, took an audacious step upwards Wednesday by opening a jewellery shop in the French capital's top gems district.

The chain store, whose distinctive pink and blue logo is synonymous with cheap and cheerful, opened its latest boutique just round the corner from Place Vendome, mecca for diamond and gold trinkets for the super-rich.

Tati's offerings start at a modest 20 francs (3 dollars) for a gold- plated heart, while its top-of-the-range solitaire ring should just about reach into neighbouring shops' price league at 30,000 francs.

"You have to go fishing where the other fishermen are; it's a sign there are fish to be had," said manager Laurent Fargeon, whose company snapped up the swank address when an airline moved out.
