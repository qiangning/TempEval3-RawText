The defection of Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz from the right-wing Likud to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Kadima gave the Israeli premier's new party a further boost in the polls Monday.

The latest survey published by the Yediot Aharonot daily found that Kadima is on course to win 41 of the 120 Knesset seats in the March 28 election, 20 more than its nearest rival, the centre-left Labour party.

Likud, which won 38 seats at the last election, is set to see its representation tumble to just 11, one ahead of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, the survey found.

Kadima's projected number of seats has gone up two since the last such survey on December 9, indicating that Mofaz's defection has had an immediate bounce effect.

In contrast, the seats projection for both Labour and Likud has dropped by two.

Mofaz announced on Sunday that he had decided to pull out of the campaign to succeed Sharon as leader of Likud, which he said was veering towards right-wing extremism, and would instead link up with the premier's new centrist party.

The survey of 500 people was conducted by the Tel Aviv-based Dahaf institute and has a 4.4 percent margin of error.
