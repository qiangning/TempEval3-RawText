Leaders at a Franco-African summit have warned against some developments in world trade that are "too liberal", French President Jacques Chirac told reporters on Sunday at a closing news conference.

"We all warned against certain evolutions that are too liberal, which risk bringing satisfaction to rich countries and emerging countries in trade issues and notably agriculture, to the detriment of the poorest countries," Chirac said.

The 148-strong World Trade Organisation will at a December 13-18 ministerial meeting in Hong Kong, push for an agreement paving the way for a global trade pact to take effect next year.

Four years of talks have largely stalled over the degree to which rich countries offer financial support to their agriculture sectors. France is the biggest recipient of EU farm subsidies.

The French leader, who gathered here with more than 20 African counterparts, plus officials from across the continent, also urged the international community to double public aid for development.

"We must, in general, double and bring to 150 billion (dollars) a year public assistance for development," he told reporters.

But he said this could not be achieved via state budgets alone, and insisted on the importance of innovative financing "to raise this sum thanks to an international tax, of one form or another.

"It's vital."
