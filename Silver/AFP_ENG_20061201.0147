Heavy rain from super-typhoon Durian caused mudslides that smothered dozens of villages in the eastern Philippines Friday, killing 388 according to the Red Cross.

The rain mixed with volcanic ash on the slopes of the Mayon volcano, located some 350 kilometers (217 miles) southeast of Manila, creating a thick brown sludge that swept down the mountainside, local authorities said.

The mudflow struck shortly after midnight, burying everything in its path and reaching the rooftops of the region's bamboo houses.

"We do not have exact figures, but we are looking at about 200 dead ... principally in the vicinity of Mayon volcano," said Glenn Rabonza, the executive officer of the national disaster coordinating council.

He said rescuers were concentrating their efforts on trying to save lives.

The Red Cross later said some 388 were killed and 96 missing following the mudflow.

Emmy Salgado, a local resident, said that a two-month old baby had been found alive on a buried hut's rooftop.

In Daraga town, just outside Legaspi city, over 20 mud-covered bodies were brought to the local basketball court for identification.

The typhoon, which hit the eastern region of Bicol before dawn Thursday, packing maximum winds of 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour, knocked out electrical services, telephone lines and water supply, further hampering rescue and relief efforts.

People could be seen wandering around many of the worst affected areas outside Legaspi, bewildered and confused, as they sifted through the debris looking for personal effects.

Some were seen repairing damaged roofs, ripped off by the typhoon during the night, with iron sheeting.

Relief services were stretched to the limit trying to find survivors and investigating reports of villages swept away.

The typhoon was initially expected to hit Manila but veered south and struck the Bicol region instead, before moving west towards the South China Sea.

Local resident Wally Magkatok said in a radio interview that "the rain was really hard and the volcanic materials mixed in with it" in his village of Tagas.

"It was only three minutes before the water level suddenly rose," he said.

"We had to rescue people in our village, especially those who had climbed onto the roofs, still hanging on to their children," he said.

They were taken by surprise as the area had rarely been hit by flooding before, he added.

Carolyn Wilson, an English examiner with the British Council who was in Legaspi when the storm hit, said it struck with incredible force, tearing off roofs, blowing in windows and uprooting trees.

The Pepperland Hotel where she was staying had roof damage, causing water to cascade in and flood most of the rooms, she said.

She added many of Legaspi's streets were flooded, with people wading through waist-deep water to check on relatives and friends.

Those living around Mayon had been evacuated from their homes only recently, in mid-August, when the volcano began belching ash and oozing lava, raising fears of a major eruption.

The volcano had calmed down by September and the residents were allowed to go home, thinking it was safe.
