The trial of Iraq's former dictator Saddam Hussein resumes on Monday with mounting pressure for the process to accelerate after two earlier adjournments limited court time to just two brief sessions.

Officials close to the court are hoping that this time a full four days of hearings is possible before the court adjourns again in time for Iraq's parliamentary elections on December 15.

Several witnesses are set to appear in the trial of Saddam and seven of his deputies for the massacre of 148 people from the Shiite village of Dujail in 1982, for which all the accused could face the death penalty.

With the trial yet to hit its stride, no witness has yet given testimony in person in the court. Amid fears over their security, tribunal sources say some witnesses could appear masked or hidden to protect their anonymity.

Saddam's lawyers, who now include former US attorney general Ramsey Clark and former Qatari justice minister Najib al-Nuaimi are looking to force further delays in a bid to give the defense more time to prepare its case.

They hope to schedule a court briefing "to discuss key issues in the case like the legality of court, independence of court and the impartiality of judges," said Clark.

The whole process, which is closely watched around the world and was called the "Trial of the Century" by one Iraqi paper, has had a slow beginning with a brief opening session on October 19, followed by a 40 day delay and then a two hour session on November 28, and then a week-long adjournment.

The trial has been plagued by a range of problems since its inception, including minor ones like intermittent sound in the first session and a broken elevator in the second session, to the more serious issues of security.

Between the first two sessions, police announced they discovered a plot to assassinate the court's top investigative judge, while two of the defense lawyers were assassinated.

The latest delay came after Taha Yassin Ramadan, a close associate of Saddam and his former vice president, refused to use the lawyer the court appointed after his advocate was shot dead.

The trial takes place in an unfinished palace once used as the headquarters for Saddam's Baath party inside the Green Zone and amid very heavy security. Attendees receive full body X-rays and are not allowed to bring their own paper and pens.

The previous session was dominated by Saddam Hussein's complaint to the judge that his American guards had taken away his pen and paper. When the judge said he would tell them to return it, Saddam exploded into a nationalist speech.

"Don't tell them, order them. You are an Iraqi, you have sovereignty, they are in your country, they are foreigners, they are invaders," said Saddam.

But the chief judge, Rizkar Mohammed Amin, a Kurd, has largely taken these outbursts in his stride.

Aside from Saddam and Ramadan, the defendants include Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam's half brother and head of intelligence at the time of the massacre, and Awad Ahmed al-Bandar, head judge of the revolutionary court.

There are also four little known Baath officials who worked in Dujail at the time of the massacre, which took place after an assassination attempt against Saddam's convoy. All have pleaded not guilty.

As the defense complains they have not had enough time to prepare for the case, there is growing frustration among Iraqis, especially among Shiites and Kurds who suffered the most under Saddam, at the constant delays.

Both Iraqi and US officials have accused the defence team of playing for time in a bid to derail the landmark trial, but the judges are under strong international pressure to ensure that Saddam enjoys the justice he is accused of denying his compatriots for so long.

In the last session, the court was shown testimony from wheelchair-bound Waddah Ismail al-Sheikh, a former intelligence official, who implicated Barzan in the Dujail massacre. The official died after the recording was made.

Iraqi officials have said they chose to start with the Dujail case because it is relatively straightforward and well documented.

But critics charge the case was chosen because it lacked the potential of the other cases for stirring up political controversy for Washington which backed Saddam's regime through the 1980s.
