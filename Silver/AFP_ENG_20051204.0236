The US lawmaker who unleashed weeks of heated debate with his call for a US troop pullout of Iraq said Sunday that he believed the George W. Bush administration was gradually coming around to his point of view.

"I think this administration is coming around," said Democratic Representative John Murtha, a staunchly pro-military former marine, speaking on ABC television's "This Week" program.

"I see the signals that they're starting to realize that the military has done everything it can do. The military has accomplished its mission," he said.

Murtha lobbed a political bombshell last month by saying time had come for US forces to quit Iraq. Last week, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, further stunned the Washington political establishment by endorsing Murtha's call.

A top administration official told ABC however, that the White House has always been committed to pulling US troops in timely fashion.

"What the president has said from the very beginning is we need to train Iraqi security forces so they can increasingly take responsibility for their own security," national security advisor Stephen Hadley said on the same program.

"As Iraqis step up, the coalition forces can step back and ultimately, come home. That's what the president said from the very beginning."

Hadley said the administration is eyeing "adjustments in the forces ... and ultimately reductions in the number of troops that need to be there."
