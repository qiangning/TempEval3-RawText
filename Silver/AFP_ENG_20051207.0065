The South Korean goverment threatened Wednesday to invoke emergency powers to avert a strike by Korean Air pilots.

The warning came after pilots of the country's largest airline said they would strike from shortly after midnight Wednesday unless they reached a last-minute compromise in pay bargaining with management.

The government issued a statement urging pilots to cancel the strike and resolve the dispute with their management through negotiations.

"Otherwise, we will take stong measures such as our emergency arbitration rights," it said in a statement.

"We have kept the door open for dialogue with management," said an official of the union that represents 1,344 of Korean Air's 1,986 pilots.

They are demanding a 6.5 percent increase in wages and a 50 percent rise in bonuses. Of the 1,126 pilots who voted, 897 supported the strike, the union said.

The pilots earlier rejected a proposal by the government's arbitration body for a 2.5 percent increase in wages and a 50 percent rise in bonuses.

Korean Air officials said the pilots had been given enough incentives this year, including special allowances amounting to 11.4 percent of their annual pay.

Due to mounting fuel costs, Korean Air suffered a net loss of 42.5 billion won (40 million dollars) in the second quarter to June but in the third quarter, net profit jumped 59 percent from a year earlier to 154.2 billion won, helped by growth in passenger demand and lower costs.

In August pilots at Korean Air called off threatened strike action after a compromise over improved working conditions was reached with management.

At rival Asiana Airlines, the government invoked rarely-used emergency powers and mobilized riot police to end a 25-day stoppage by pilots in August.

"Korean Air's stoppage will seriously hurt our exports and credibility abroad," Construction and Transportation Minister Choo Byung-Jik said.

The goverment estimates that a strike by Korean Air pilots could cause 18.7 billion won (18.1 million dollars) in losses to the airline and 50 billion won to the country.

Korean Air accounts for 40.6 percent of international passenger services and 48.1 percent of international cargo services out of South Korea.
