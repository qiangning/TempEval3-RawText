Israeli military preparations for the summer war in Lebanon and the way troops were used on operations were deficient, a probe into the conduct of staff headquarters found, state radio reported on Friday.

In its conclusions, the inquiry apportions no blame to individual staff officers for these deficiencies, it added.

The probe was handed in mid-October to reserve general Dan Shomron, 69, a former chief of staff between 1987 and 1991, by the man who currently holds the post, General Dan Halutz.

Friday's delivery of Shomron's conclusions marks the end of the internal inquiry into the heart of the Israeli military.

From next week Halutz and his senior staff officers will examine the lessons to be learnt from Israeli failures in the 34-day summer war with the Shiite Lebanese militia Hezbollah, state radio said.

Since the war ended in a UN-brokered ceasefire on August 14, there have been calls by many protesters, including army reservists who took part in the conflict, for a state commission of inquiry into the war's failures.

There have also been demands for Halutz, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defence Minister Amir Peretz to resign.

The Olmert government finally opted under domestic pressure on September 17 to establish a five-member government commission headed by retired judge Eliyahu Winograd.

Olmert said at the time the government commission would have the same powers as a state commission -- Israel's most powerful type of public inquiry which many government critics had wanted.

The difference between the two bodies hangs on their composition: the supreme court, as the highest legal authority, names members of a state commission of inquiry, while those politicians in power name the members of a government commission.

Failures of the July 12-August 14 Lebanon war have been the subject of two other probes -- one headed by the state comptroller and the other by the foreign affairs and defence committees in parliament.

The Olmert government came under intense criticism over the Lebanon war, which saw more than 160 Israelis killed but which failed to achieve its main objectives -- to stop Hezbollah from being able to fire nearly 4,000 rockets into Israel and to secure the release of two soldiers seized by militants in the July 12 cross-border raid that sparked the conflict.

Israel was also slammed abroad for the devastating use of its firepower in Lebanon, where more than 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- were killed, and thousands of homes and infrastructure targets were bombed.
