Economic growth and the creation of jobs are to be included in the final declaration of the 4th Summit of the Americas to be held in Argentina on Nov. 4 and 5.

Coordinators of the summit said the declaration, to be signed by heads of state and government at the end of the summit, is almost ready. Leaders of the Western Hemisphere or their representatives, except Cuba, are to take part, organizers said.

Preparatory meetings for the summit were held earlier this week. The president of the meetings, Argentine Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana, said the creation of jobs and strengthening of democratic governance are major topics of the summit initiated by Argentina.

According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean based in Santiago, Chile, poverty affects nearly 40 percent of the 500 million people in the region.

Secretary General of the Organization of American States Jose Miguel Insulza, who will participate in the summit, said, "There are too many poor in Latin America in spite of economic growth in the region."

It is necessary for governments and business circles in Latin America to step up efforts to increase economic growth and improve the situation of the poor, he said.

Coordinators of the summit did not say whether there will be any mention of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in the final declaration.

US President George W. Bush claimed that continental free trade through the FTAA will reduce poverty in Latin America and drive growth and employment.

However, Brazil and Argentina, both major food exporters in Latin America, said they were reluctant to join the FTAA as long as the United States does not eliminate agricultural subsidies.

They complained that Washington's agricultural subsidies would eliminate the competitiveness of farm products from other American countries and increase poverty in Latin America.

Venezuela opposes the FTAA due to its political differences with Washington.
