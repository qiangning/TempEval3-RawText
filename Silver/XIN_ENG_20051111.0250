Chinese President Hu Jintao said here on Friday that China is willing to work together with the new German government to push forward the bilateral relations.

During his meeting with designated chancellor Angela Merkel, Hu congratulated her on becoming the first woman chancellor in the German history, and spoke highly of her long-term contributions to the development of Sino-German relations.

Developing Sino-German relations conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples, he said, adding that China will keep high-level exchanges and contacts with Germany and make joint efforts with the new German government to expand bilateral cooperation in all fields.

Merkel said that the new German government will stick to the policy toward China, which has been upheld since former chancellor Helmut Kohl took power.

The new government will strengthen political dialogues with China and explore new areas for bilateral cooperation, she added.

Hu arrived here Thursday after a state visit to Britain. Germany is the second leg of his four-nation European-Asian tour, which will also take him to Spain and South Korea. He is also scheduled to attend the 13th APEC Economic Leaders Meeting in Busan, South Korea, on Nov. 18-19.
