Presidents of five Portuguese- speaking countries have held discussions in the Angolan capital on the simmering political tensions in Guinea-Bissau.

The meeting took place Thursday night on the sidelines of celebrations marking the 30th anniversary of Angola's independence from Portugal on Friday.

According to reports quoting diplomatic sources, the unscheduled gathering lasting more than one hour focused on issues related to the consolidation of democracy and economic development in Guinea-Bissau.

Besides Guinea-Bissau's newly elected president, Joao Bernardo "Nino'' Vieira, other participants were Presidents Jorge Sampaio of Portugal, Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, Pedro Pires of Cape Verde and Fradique de Menezes of Sao Tome and Principe.

Representatives of the Brazilian, Mozambican and East Timorese presidents, who are not attending the Angolan festivities, also took part in the talks that ended without any public statement.

The eight nations make up the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries that is headquartered in Lisbon.

Meanwhile in Bissau, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) which Vieira dismissed from government on October 28 reiterated its charges that the country's new government was "illegal" and "unconstitutional."

The PAIGC party is loyal to former prime minister Carlos Gomes Junior, whom Vieira sacked also on October 28.

According to sources from Bissau, the PAIGC would continue to challenge the legitimacy of the new government of Prime Minister Aristides Gomes, a PAIGC dissident who was suspended from party functions last May for backing Vieira's successful presidential election bid, before the Supreme Court and in parliament.
