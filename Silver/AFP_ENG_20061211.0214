A second weightlifter from Myanmar has tested positive for drugs and has been stripped of her medal and disqualified from the Asian Games, the Olympic Council of Asia announced Monday.

She was named as Oo Mya Sanda, 29, who won the silver medal in the 75kg category.

Oo tested positive for a metabolite of an anabolic agent that helps athletes build muscle bulk and also hastens the recovery period after training. She waived her right to have her "B" sample tested.

It means that South Korea's Kim Soon now gets the silver and Indonesia's Sinta Darmariani is promoted from fourth to third. China's Cao Lei won gold.

Fellow Myanmar competitor Kyi Kyi Than, who failed to win a medal in the women's 48kg category, was disqualified on Saturday for failing a drugs test.

Uzbek weightlifters Elmira Ramileva and Alexander Urinov, in the women's 69kg and men's 105kg categories respectively, were tossed out of the Games on Sunday for doping offences.

Despite drugs again blighting a major sporting event, Olympic Council of Asia director general Husain al-Musallem said given there had been more than 800 drugs tests here so far, four positives was not a bad percentage.

"We have conducted more than 800 tests and the percentage of positives is not high compared to other big events like this," he said.

"People complain about weightlifting, but weightlifting is a good sport. There are just some individual cheaters, or they have been given the wrong advice.

"We are fighting the cheaters. Hopefully in the future we can eliminate all cheaters."

Despite the positive drugs tests, Musallem said the Games were "in a good state".

"Before, the positive cases were high and the testing levels low," he said.

"In Busan four years ago, we had under 1,000 tests and around 10 positive tests, while the number of sports was less and there was no pre-competition testing.

"In these Games, we will carry out 1,200 urine tests and around 50 blood tests. We also carried out 86 pre-competition tests."

Musallem said the OCA had initiated a drugs awareness programme in 2004 in the run-up to the Games.

"Asia is divided into five regions, and we organised two-day briefings for NOC officials (in the respective regions) about the doping programme," including information on banned drugs and how to access that information.

Musallem added that the OCA's own website would shortly launch a multilingual guide to the list of banned substances currently only available in English, in a bid to avoid any confusion.
