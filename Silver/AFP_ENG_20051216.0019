Police in the Indonesian district of Solo said Friday they had ordered churches in the area to dig holes into which suspected bombs could be tossed, amid fears of Christmas attacks.

The police chief in Central Java's Solo told church officials to dig holes one metre (yard) cubed outside their buildings, local policeman Supran Yoga said.

"This is in anticipation of bombings," he told AFP.

The Koran Tempo newspaper also said police would scour all 61 churches in Solo, located about 500 kilometres (300 miles) southeast of the capital Jakarta, looking for bombs before services on Christmas Eve.

Raids were carried out on several houses in Solo after the triple suicide bombings on the resort island of Bali on October 1, which killed 20 bystanders.

Malaysian bomb-maker Azahari Husin, who was tracked down and killed by police in November, as well as his on-the-run compatriot Noordin Mohammad Top, were both linked to the bombings and are believed to have spent time in Solo.

Indonesia's intelligence agency warned last week that information indicated extremists may be planning attacks over the Christmas-New Year period in large cities across the sprawling archipelago.

Jakarta police have said they will deploy 18,000 officers across the capital during that time.

Nineteen people were killed when Islamic extremists launched a coordinated nationwide bombing campaign targeting churches and priests on Christmas Eve in 2000.

The attacks were blamed on the Al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network, which has also been blamed for a string of deadly attacks in Indonesia since then, including the 2002 Bali bombing, which left 202 people dead.

Azahari and Top were believed to be JI members but experts say the pair may have split off to form an even more hardline group.
