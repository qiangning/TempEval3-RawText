French international defender Willy Sagnol has urged Bayern Munich to get the cheque book out in the winter break and sign AC Milan's Brazilian international playmaker Kaka.

"Having a player like Kaka - who I know wants to leave AC Milan - at Bayern would be a dream," Sagnol said in an interview with the Munchner AZ. "Of course he would not be cheap but it would be a great idea for us to sign a playmaker in the winter break."

AC Milan are in the bottom half of the Serie A table but would be reluctant to part with midfield maestro Kaka particulary after losing Ukraine international Andrei Shevchenko to Chelsea in the summer.

Bayern watched German international captain Michael Ballack join Chelsea on a free transfer in the summer themselves and have struggled without him, lying third in the league heading into the six-week winter hiatus.

The 29-year-old Sagnol, who signed from Monaco in 2000, plans to end his career at Bayern and dreams of repeating the 2001 Champions League win.

"I am here until 2010 and I hope to win the Champions League again," added Sagnol.

Bayern have reached the last 16 of this season's Champions League where they will face Real Madrid.
