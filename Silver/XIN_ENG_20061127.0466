Thailand's Pichet Krungget Monday shattered American Matt Parry's world record of 14.78 seconds in the men's 100-meters wheelchair event at the 9th Far East & South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in Kuala Lumpur.

The 2004 Athens Paralympic gold medallist's record of 14.76 seconds erased the old mark the American set at the 1998 Paralympic Games in Atlanta.

The silver medal went to China's Yu Shiran, while the bronze was won by Hong Suk-man of South Korea.

The 31-year-old Pichet is the second Thai to brake a record at the FESPIC Games following Prawat Wahorum's mark of 10'40"48 for the men's 5,000-meters wheelchair event on Sunday.

The wheelchair-bound Pichet now must honor his promise to organize an open-air movie show.

"Before I came here I made a wish that I will host an outdoor movie show for one night. I guess I have to keep my promise when I get back home, but I still have more events to complete," said Pichet, who will also contest four more events -- the men's 200m, 400m, 4x100m and 4x400m.

"I tried to go out there pressure free. Breaking the world record is an extra," said the 2005 Asean Para Games champion.

Earlier in the event, Thailand's Peth Rungsri won two more gold medals from athletics and broke two Games records. He won the men' s wheelchair 200m in 33.52 seconds, bettering Japan's Yasunari Yaezawa's record of 36.88, and also clocked 19.25 seconds in the 100m wheelchair event to break the old mark of 19.62 seconds set by Yasunari.

Thailand won three more gold medals through Suphachai Koysab in the men's wheelchair 100m event, Jirawat Meesuk in the men's 200m wheelchair and Jakkit Punthong in the men's long jump.

Thailand collected another five gold medals from the swimming event and one gold medal each in the weightlifting, judo and tennis.
