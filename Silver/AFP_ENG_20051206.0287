The 55 member states of the OSCE failed Tuesday to agree a joint declaration at a ministerial meeting here, instead issuing a statement by the current holder of its rotating presidency, Slovenia.

The statement was issued by the conference chairman, Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel.

The move followed Russia's refusal to acknowledge a 1999 commitment to withdraw troops from Georgia and Moldova.
