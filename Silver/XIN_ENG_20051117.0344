The Spanish government will give two million euros (around 2.3 million US dollars) to the organizers of the Americas Cup, the sailing event hosted by the Spanish city of Valencia in 2007, local media said on Thursday.

The plan was approved on Thursday in a ceremony attended by Jordi Sevilla, Spain's minister of public affairs, and Ricard Perez Casado, Americas Cup president.

The money will be used to launch an international publicity campaign promoting Valencia and the Americas Cup. Casado and Sevilla approved the marketing plan drawn up by the Americas Cup coordination committee at the same time as approving the deal.
