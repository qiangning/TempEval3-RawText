The European Union (EU) on Thursday welcomed new commitments from the English Premier League regarding the sale of its match broadcast rights.

The EU's executive body, the European Commission, said it has received "improved commitments" from the Premier League which makes it possible to finally resolve the three-year-long dispute by spring next year.

The league pledges that from 2007 onwards live TV broadcast rights of its matches will "be sold in six balanced packages with no one bidder being allowed to buy all six packages," the commission said in a statement.

Packages will be sold to the highest stand-alone bidder for each package, and bids other than simple stand-alone bids will be disregarded, it said.

The deal will break BSkyB's exclusive ownership of live TV rights for England's top class football games, which the company has enjoyed for 13 years.

The commission will select a trustee to monitor the auction, who will then report to the commission whether all rules have been followed.

The commission will now prepare a draft decision making the Premier League's revised commitments legally binding. This will be sent to the competition authorities of the EU member states for consultation before the commission issues a final decision by the first quarter of 2006.

"I am pleased to bring this long running case closer to a satisfactory outcome," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"The commitments offered by the Premier League should ensure that the media rights are sold in a fair and transparent manner and give British football fans greater choice and better value," she said.
