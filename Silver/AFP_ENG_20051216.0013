Hollywood star Cate Blanchett led a group of Australian celebrities in a Sydney beach ceremony Friday to appeal for calm after race riots this week.

The Oscar-winning Australian actress turned out at upmarket Coogee Beach with other actors and musicians to urge racial tolerance after mobs of whites attacked Arab-Australians on a beach last Sunday.

"It's actually very clear and simple," said Blanchett, dressed casually in a sun-hat, jacket and designer jeans in front of a banner calling for a "wave of tolerance" to sweep Australia.

"Violence and racism are bad. Whenever they occur they are to be condemned (and) we should not turn a blind eye to them.

"It's about respect. Respect for others, respect for the rights of others and respect of the rights of everyone to go about their lives in a peaceful way."

The group with Blanchett, who won best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in the 2004 film The Aviator with Leonardo DiCaprio, included former Midnight Oil rock star turned politician Peter Garrett.

Garrett, now a member of parliament for the opposition Labor Party, said the group was delivering a message about "the unacceptability of violence (and) the necessity for us to embrace respect and tolerance".

The appeal was sparked by fears that new clashes could erupt on Sydney beaches this weekend.

Dozens of people were injured and arrested in the violence, in which white mobs set out to "reclaim the beach" from groups of Lebanese-Australians accused of intimidating other beachgoers with boorish behaviour at weekends.

Groups of mainly ethnic-Lebanese men then launched a wave of revenge attacks, and thousands of police will patrol trouble spots this weekend in an attempt to prevent a repeat performance.
