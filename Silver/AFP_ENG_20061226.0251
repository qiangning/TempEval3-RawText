Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on Tuesday said more than 1,000 people have been killed in fighting between his troops backing Somali government forces against Somalia's Islamist movement.

"We got reports of more than 3,000 wounded in a Mogadishu hospital. Those who died are well over 1,000," Meles told a press conference in Addis Ababa, two days after Ethiopia acknowledged military intervention in the neighbouring and lawless Horn of Africa nation.

The Islamists acknowledged that they had been forced to withdraw from many front-line positions but vowed to dig in for a long war with Ethiopia, which has denied intentions of taking the Islamist stronghold Mogadishu.

"Our forces and that of the (transitional federal government) have broken the back of the international terrorist forces around Baidoa and they are in full retreat now," Meles said in the wake of air strikes on Islamist targets and artillery battles on several fronts.

Earlier, the International Committee of the Red Cross said more than 800 wounded were reported at hospitals the agency was in contact with. Thousands have fled their homes, the agency's spokeswoman Antonella Notari said in Geneva.

The weak transitional government holds only one major town, Baidoa, in the southern central region, while the Islamic Court Union forces in June seized the capital Mogadishu from warlords and then extended their control over south and central Somalia.

Government fighters began to advance on the powerful Islamist movement after Ethiopian warplanes bombed Mogadishu airport and other airfields held by the Islamists to cut supply lines.

"We are only 100 kilometres (60 miles) away from Mogadishu and are heading to it," Somalia's ambassador to Ethiopia, Abdelkarin Farah, told journalists in Addis Ababa.

Meles, who said he had deployed between 3,000 to 4,000 troops, denied the Ethiopian forces planned to take Mogadishu or any other town. UN reports had said Addis Ababa deployed 8,000 troops, while its regional foe Eritrea sent 2,000 to back the Islamists.

"Liberating towns is not our agenda. Our troops have not entered any town," the prime minister added. Mainly Christian Ethiopia justified its intervention on the grounds that the Islamists represent a direct threat to its own security and sovereignty, and has aligned with Washington in linking their radical leaders with the Al-Qaeda network.

Islamist fighters withdrew from two front lines near Baidoa, the government seat northwest of the capital, and in central Somalia, witnesses and officials said.

"There is a lot of pressure from every front line," an Islamist commander told AFP on condition of anonymity, explaining that Islamist forces had pulled back from several posts including Burhakaba and Dinsoor.

"We have decided to change our tactics," Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the head of the Islamist executive committee, told a press conference in Mogadishu. "We are ready to start long-lasting war with Ethiopia."

Heavy fighting began last week after the Islamists demanded the departure of Ethiopian troops backing the internationally recognised but largely powerless government in a country of 10 million people wracked by conflict since the 1991 ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.

Ethiopia's government said its forces had inflicted "heavy human and material losses" on the Islamists, while the air force would "intensify pounding selected targets."

Meles said the enemy included "many Eritrean troops, international jihadists and Shebab (youth militias)" while the information ministry said two Ethiopian separatist groups were also involved.

"We ask all the foreign fighters to pull out of the country and allow Somalis to seek ways of reconciling and establishing peace," Somali government spokesman Abdirahman Dinari told AFP in Baidoa. "We strongly appeal to the Islamic courts to put down arms because the government has made a decision to give them complete amnesty."

The Islamists have steadily gained ground, often imposing strict Sharia law on territory in their hands, since they in June routed a US-backed alliance in Mogadishu of the warlords who support the interim adminstration.
