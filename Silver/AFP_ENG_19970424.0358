The findings of official studies by the Roman Catholic Church on the Turin shroud, a strip of cloth traditionally held to have wrapped the body of Christ after his crucifixion, are not definitive, the archbishop of Turin announced here Thursday.

An official commission appointed by the Vatican in 1988 carbon-dated "with a 95-percent reliability rate" the cloth to between 1260 and 1390.

During a press conference about two exhibitions on the shroud which will take place in 1998 and 2000, Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini, the Vatican's official guardian of the shroud, said fresh scientific studies could be carried out.

However, he added, such studies "are not planned for the moment."

The exhibitions will be for exclusively religious ends, the cardinal said, and do not imply the Church had taken a "position on the scientific discussions on the authenticity of this historic, unique and prestigious artifact evoking the death of Christ on the cross."

The 4.4-metre (14.5-foot) by 1.1-metre (3.3-foot) shroud was saved at the last minute on April 12 when a blaze ravaged the chapel in Turin cathedral where it is normally housed. It had been transferred to another part of the cathedral earlier while restoration work was underway in the chapel.

Three sections of one centimetre (0.4 inch) by seven centimetres (2.8 inches) each had been cut from the cloth for the carbon-testing by British, Swiss and US laboratories.

According to another Vatican study of the Shroud by specialist Giulio Ricci, the man who was held in the cloth measured 1.62 metres (five foot four inches).

It is currently being held in a secret location.

The last time the Shroud was shown, in 1978, more than three million pilgrims made the trip to Turin to view it.

A negative imprint on the cloth suggesting a face and body bearing wounds was worshipped to be that of Christ.

First reports of the Shroud go back to the seventh century in Jerusalem. It was transferred to Constantinople where it was put on show every Friday until the 12th century.

The relic disappeared during the fourth Crusades between 1202 and 1204, carried off, according to legend, by crusading knight Geoffroy de Charny, after the fall of Constantinople.

It is believed the current Shroud is not the one that disappeared from Constantinople.

Without taking a stand, the Church nevertheless holds the cloth is valuable for the feeling it produces among the faithful.

"This unique and unsettling image continues to call to all people as a gift made by God to the conscience of all those who want to reflect on the mysteries of God's love," Saldarini said.

He added that while it was "completely understandable to want to know if this shroud really held Jesus after his death, it is necessary to note that the Shroud is not in any way Jesus, but only a sign which speaks to us of what he did for us."
