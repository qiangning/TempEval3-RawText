Shanghai will not build a landmark architecture for the 2010 World Expo but will bequeath a huge spiritual legacy to later generations, said Zhou Hanmin, deputy director of the expo's coordination committee.

He said the expo will perform three major functions of reshaping of cities and countries, displaying of world cultural diversity and innovation in science and technology, and the enlightenment of future generations.

Zhou made the remarks on Saturday at an international symposium held by the Japanese Research Center of Shanghai-based Fudan University.

He emphasized that the city will not construct any buildings with the intention of creating a landmark for the expo, sharing the same opinion with Fukui Shohei, the chief designer of Expo 2005 Aichi Japan.

"In departure from previous expos, the coming expo will highlight man's attitudes towards the nature, society and the future," said the deputy director.

With the theme of "Better City, Better Life," the expo will be held from May 1 to October 31, 2010, in east China's Shanghai Municipality. It will be located on the banks of the Huangpu River, the "Mother River of Shanghai," between the Lupu Bridge and the Nanpu Bridge.

The predicted number of participant countries and international organizations is 200 and more than 70 million visitors are expected.
