Kenya's three-month annualised inflation rose to 35.6 percent in March from 14.7 percent in February as a result of food shortages caused by widespread drought earlier this year, the Central Bank said Wednesday.

The overall month-on-month inflation also rose to 15.6 percent in March from 11.9 percent in February, with the average annual inflation increasing to 10.7 from 9.9 percent during the same period.

"The surge in the overall inflation during the first quarter of the year was traced to the severe decline in agricultural output following the drought", the bank's monthly economic review for April says.

The food price index increased by 43 percent during the year to March 1997, compared to the earlier increase of 17 percent during the same period last year.

The Kenyan shilling gained against major currencies in March when it was trading at 54.90 to the dollar compared with 54.93 in February.

The overall balance of payments in the year up to February 1997 was a surplus of 504 million dollars compared with a deficit of 102 million dollars in the year to February 1996.
