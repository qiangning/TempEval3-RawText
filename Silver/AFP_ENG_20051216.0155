Deutsche Boerse, operator of the German stock exchange, did not make an "informal" tie-up offer to rival group Euronext, which operates the Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon exchanges, a supervisory board member told AFP on Friday on condition of anonymity.

"There was nothing like that. If there had been, the supervisory board would have been informed," the source said.

Indeed, Deutsche Boerse's newly installed management team would likely wait before embarking on any tie-up projects, it said.

"At present, management's top priority is to remunerate shareholders."

On Friday, Deutsche Boerse announced that it expected to reach its goal of paying out 800 million euros (960 million dollars) to shareholders, most of them investment funds, by way of share buy-backs and dividends. And the group plans to dish out a total 1.5 billion euros to shareholders by 2007.

The French daily Le Figaro had reported in its Friday edition that the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange had made an overture to Euronext last weekend with a view to a possible tie-up.

For its part, Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.

"I can't make a statement on that specific article," a Deutsche Boerse spokesman said.

"We've already said that we're open to cooperation on condition it is in the interest of Deutsche Boerse," he added, noting that talks were held regularly in the sector.

The German group has tried on several occasions to tie the knot with the London Stock Exchange. But its latest tie-up attempt ended in spectacular failure earlier this year with the ouster of the chief executive Werner Seifert.
