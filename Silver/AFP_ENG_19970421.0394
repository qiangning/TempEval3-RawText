A leading businessman arranged to pay 1.3 million punts (two million dollars) to former Irish prime minister Charles Haughey while he was still head of government, a corruption inquiry was told Monday.

The tribunal was set up in February to trace who received 3.5 million punts of a total 5.63 million punts (nine million dollars) paid out by millionaire supermarket boss Ben Dunne.

The payments controversy first came to light last November when the then transport minister, Michael Lowry, resigned after it emerged that Dunne had paid for an extension worth 400,000 punts (650,000 dollars) to his home.

The tribunal heard Monday that Dunne himself would later tell the court of the 1.3 million punt payment to Haughey, who resigned as premier and leader of the Fianna Fail party in 1992.

The court heard there would be evidence that the money had been requested to "overcome business problems relating to Mr. Haughey."

Speculation over Haughey's involvement has been intense, although until Monday the name of the man referred to as a "very prominent former member of parliament" had never been officially disclosed.

Like the "sleaze" scandal which has dogged the Conservative party during the British general election campaign, the allegations and the inquiry threaten to overshadow Fianna Fail's bid to win power from the ruling coalition in general elections that could be held as early as next month.

But unlike in Britain, the sums involved are much larger, the accusations go right to the top of the party and the inquiry could run in tandem with the election campaign as any decision to suspend it is for the judiciary alone.
