Italian troops will not be sent to southern Albania because of anti- Italian feeling in the port of Vlore, after an Albanian refugee boat sank in a collision with an Italian warship leaving 79 people missing, a military source said here Tuesday.

The Italian authorities were "dismayed" by reports from the Albanian authorities on the mood in the south of the country, notably in Vlore from where many of the victims of Friday's accident hailed from, added the source.

At least four people died in the collision and 34 others were rescued. Howver, 79 are still unaccounted for.

However, Italy had not yet taken a final decision on where it would deploy the 2,000 troops it has earmarked for the UN-sanction operation to protect relief supplies to Albania, the source added.

A 5,000-strong multinational force led by Italy , could be deployed within 10 days, Italy's Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta announced Tuesday.

Vlore is one of the two ports of which the force will control.
