Malaysia and the United States are to sign an "open skies" agreement liberalising bilateral aviation traffic in June, Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Wednesday.

The national news agency Bernama quoted Ling as saying that the cabinet approved the signing of the pact at its weekly meeting Wednesday.

Ling said the signing would take place after he attended the meeting of transport ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum from June 22-24 in Victoria, Canada.

Malaysia would be the second Asian country after Singapore to sign such an aviation agreement with the United States, which is pushing for an end to protected aviation markets.
