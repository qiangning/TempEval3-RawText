Dozens of war veterans disabled by chemical weapon attacks during the 1980-1988 war against Iraq staged a sit-in Thursday in front of the German embassy here to protest alleged chemical aid to Baghdad by German firms.

They began their protest on Wednesday along with thousands of other people, and some 200 people stayed camped outside the mission overnight.

The veterans, who included patients who left hospital for the protest, set up a canvas awning on the pavement in front of the embassy compound to shelter them from rain.

They are also protesting a German court ruling accusing the Iranian government in the 1992 murder of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin. The veterans have vowed to stay there until Bonn appologizes to Tehran for the "insult."

A giant poster of a young man with his face badly deformed by a chemical attack has been set up along the front gate of the compound as a proof of "German crimes" against Iran.

The veterans came forward after the Iranian authorities accused 24 German companies of providing Iraq with chemical weapons technology in the 1980s, saying they were preparing to sue them.

Bonn says several German pharmaceutical companies helped Iraq to build agricultural plants, but that the factories were later modified to produce chemical weapons.

The state Foundation for the War Disabled has brought a number of disabled veterans from hospitals and dropped them off in front of the mission, which is tightly protected by Iranian security forces.

A make-shift hospital has been set up in the area to care for the patients while they continue with their protest, Iran's official IRNA news agency said.

Several rallies have already been held in front of the German embassy in Tehran and in other Iranian cities since the Berlin court verdict was announced a week ago.
