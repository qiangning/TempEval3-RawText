A political prisoner convicted to two years in jail for "public insult" to Belarus's iron-fisted leader Alexander Lukashenko was denied a requested one-day leave to attend his father's funeral, his family said.

Valery Levonevsky, leader of the entrepreneurs' strike committee, was only allowed to phone home to voice his condolences, his son Vladimir told AFP late Thursday, saying the jail administration justified their decision by "repeated violations of regime" by Levonevsky.

"I understand that my father is in jail for political reasons, but this is inhuman -- not to let him attend his father's funeral," Vladimir said.

According to lawyer Garry Pogonyailo, it is up to the jail's administrators to grant a leave in case of exceptional circumstances, "and as practice shows, normally those criminals that are not dangerous are allowed to go to funerals."

"But since Levonevsky is a political prisoner, the attitude is very different," he added.

Levonevsky was convicted last September on charge of insult to Lukashenko, which the court saw in a leaflet calling on Belarusians to "come and say if you are against somebody vacationing in Austria, skiing and living as he pleases on your money."

Lukashenko has earned stinging criticism from the West for suppressing liberties and cracking down on his political opponents during ten years at the helm of the former Soviet republic.
