China and the United States on Wednesday held their third round of strategic dialogue in Beijing, discussing bilateral ties and other issues of common concern.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and the U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns co-chaired the strategic dialogue.

"The United States and China have very important relationship," Burns said in the opening address.

"The relationship focuses on bilateral issues that motivate us from day to day, and we also have other issues. (Because) together we have responsibility for global peace and global security," Burns said.

The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on bilateral ties and international and regional issues of common concern, according to a statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

The dialogue also touched upon the Korean Peninsular nuclear issue. Burns said in a meeting with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo that "we will see what we can do with" the North Korea's nuclear issue.

Later Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing also met with Burns.

Burns arrived in Beijing Tuesday evening. This was his first time to lead the U.S. side in strategic dialogue with China.

Two rounds of China-U.S. strategic dialogues had been held in August and December last year.
