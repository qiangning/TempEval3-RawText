The Philippine state weather bureau PAGASA Tuesday said typhoon Pepeng has entered the Philippine area and is threatening to bring rains over Surigao del Norte in Mindanao.

At 2:00 a.m. local time Tuesday, the typhoon was located by surface and satellite data at 330 kilometers east and northeast of Surigao City in Surigao del Norte province with maximum sustained winds of 55 kilometers per hour near the center. It is forecast to move north at 15 kilometers per hour.

Pepeng is the 16th typhoon to hit the country this year. Typhoons gather strength from warm sea water and tend to dissipate after making landfall.

PAGASA said the central and southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao regions will experience cloudy skies with scattered showers and thunderstorms becoming widespread over the eastern part of the country. The rest of Luzon will have mostly cloudy skies with showers and thunderstorms.

Meanwhile, moderate to occasionally strong winds blowing from the northeast will prevail over northern and eastern Luzon and eastern Visayas. Coastal waters of these areas will be moderate to occasionally rough and becoming light to moderate over the rest of the country.
