The United Nations Climate Change Conference wrapped up in Nairobi late Friday with the adoption of a wide range of decisions which are seen as a boost to the adaptation of developing countries to the effects of global warming.

"The conference has delivered on its promise to support the needs of developing countries," said Conference President Kivutha Kibwana, who is also the Kenyan Minister for Natural Resources and Environment. "The positive spirit of the conference has prevailed, " he added.

A statement issued at the press conference after the meeting said the "spirit of Nairobi" prevails as the climate change conference held first time in sub-Sahara Africa successfully concluded.

The success is manifested in several agreements. At the meeting, activities for the next few years under the "Nairobi Work Program on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation" were agreed. These activities will help enhance decision-making on adaptation action and improved assessment of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change.

Another important outcome, according to the statement, is the agreement on the management of the Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol, which will be helpful to support concrete adaptation activities in developing countries.

Delegates also welcome the "Nairobi Framework" announced by the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which will provide additional support to developing countries to successfully develop projects for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

The CDM permits industrialized countries, which have emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol, to invest in sustainable development projects in developing countries that reduce greenhouse gas emission, and thereby generate tradable emission credits.

Officials said rules were finalized for the Special Climate Change Fund, which is another concrete progress at the conference. The fund is designed to finance projects in developing countries relating to adaptation, technology transfer, climate change mitigation and economic diversification for countries highly dependent on income from fossil fuels.

"The spirit of Nairobi has been truly remarkable," Kibwana said.

"Let us now use the momentum of this conference to carry this spirit forward and jointly undertake the kind of concerted action we need for humankind to have a future on this planet," he added.

The next round of negotiations under the Kyoto Protocol and talks under the United Nations Climate Change Convention will be held in Bonn, Germany in May 2007.
