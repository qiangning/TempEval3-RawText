Ecuador's Rafael Correa has won Sunday's presidential run-off with 57.04 percent of the votes against his rival Alvaro Noboa with 42.96 percent, after 97.29 percent of votes were counted, Ecuador's Supreme Electoral Tribunal said on Tuesday.

Following is the profile of the presidential-elect:

Correa was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador's second largest city, on April 6, 1963. He earned a doctorate from the University of Illinois from 1999 to 2001. His master's degree was earned in Belgium's Catholic University of Lovaina, where he also met his wife Anne Malherbe.

From 1992 to 1993 he was director of administration and finance for educational projects at the Inter-American Development Bank. He was economy minister from April to August 2005.

An economics professor before serving as the economy minister, he was opposed to neo-liberalism, and has promised not to sign a free trade agreement with the United States, to set an upper limit on external debt payments, and to join a Latin American integrationist movement. Despite being a strong public critic of the policy, he has also pledged to maintain dollarization.

In terms of domestic politics, he promises to restructure Ecuador's political institutions using a popular assembly, drawn from the general citizen pool rather than parties.

He speaks French, English and some Quechua, a major indigenous language in Ecuador.

Correa founded the Moviento Patria Altiva "i" Soberana (PAiS) after being sacked from the post of economy minister after 106 days.

Correa pushed for a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution, which he says is needed to bypass a corrupt congress and curb political party influence in independent institutions such as the courts.

Correa also vowed to help farmers, private entrepreneurs and businessmen benefit from economic development and draw out a new strategy on social development, attach great importance to the development of education and health programs, and make his efforts to reduce a high unemployment rate, to stabilize foreign debt and to establish social development funds.

Diplomatically, he opposed external interference and pledged to guarantee national energy and cultural sovereignty on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit and cooperation.
