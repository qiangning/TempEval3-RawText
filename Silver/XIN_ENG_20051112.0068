A senior Palestinian official said on Saturday that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) will not reach any agreement with Israel before release of all Palestinian prisoners.

Minister of Prisoners' Affairs Sufian Abu Zayda told the Voice of Palestine that the PNA insists on releasing all the Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails without any discrimination.

Abu Zayda made the remarks after visiting ill Palestinian prisoners in Al-Ramla and Beer Sheva detentions, where some of them received medical treatment.

"The prisoners' health condition needs an immediate interference of international human rights institutions and medical teams," he said.

He accused the Israeli prison authorities of negligence toward ill prisoners.

There are reportedly more than 8,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

Israel claims that it will never release those "with blood on their hands," referring to Palestinians who were involved in attacks on Israeli targets.
