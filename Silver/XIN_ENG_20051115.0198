Spain's largest airline Iberia netted 372.6 million euros (436 million US dollars) in the third quarter profits, a multi-fold increase over the same period of last year, according to the national carrier's report released Tuesday.

The eye-catching surge against 87.9 million euros (103 million dollars) a year earlier was largely linked to extraordinary gains from the sale of its stake in travel reservations company Amadeus.

The report put Iberia's revenue for the third quarter at 1.98 billion euros (2.32 billion dollar), up from 1.29 billion euros (1.51 billion dollars).

The company's key occupation rate hit a record high in October, when its passenger load factor reached 80.2 percent, representing a rise of 3 percentage points from the same month of last year.

The rise was backed by solid increases in passenger occupation rates at Iberia's intercontinental flights, the report said.
