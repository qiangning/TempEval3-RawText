China's rural women worry about their children's education the most, followed by their livelihood and health, according to a national survey.

The All-China Women's Federation carried out the survey on the status of rural women's rights protection with 6,596 questionnaires distributed in 416 villages in eight provinces as well as 53 migrant worker residences in four major cities.

The survey showed 35.8 percent of respondents worried about their children's education, 34.5 percent about making a living and 14 percent about their health.

The survey also showed rural women wanted women's federations to help in better safeguarding women's rights, advice on improving their living standard and poverty relief assistance.

Mo Wenxiu, vice chairwoman of the federation and vice director of the survey group, said, "We found rural women's legal awareness enhanced, as 81.1 percent respondents knew the Law on Women's Rights Protection."

The survey showed 77 percent rural women and 68.7 percent of female migrant workers said they knew of or had accepted legal aid or judicial assistance.
