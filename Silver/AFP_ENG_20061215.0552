Wall Street's main stock indexes pushed to new highs Friday for a second straight day after a tame report on consumer inflation boosted hopes for lower interest rates in 2007.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 28.76 points (0.23 percent) to 12,444.52, its second consecutive all-time record close, after hitting an intraday high of 12,486.30.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index advanced 3.35 points (0.14 percent) to 2,457.20 a day after closing at its highest level since February 2001.

The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index edged up 1.60 points (0.11 percent) to 1,427.09, a fresh six-year high.

Markets opened stronger and pared their gains late in the session as investors locked in gains at the conclusion of a strong week.

Ahead of the opening, the Labor Department reported that its consumer price index (CPI) was flat in November, including the "core" index that excludes food and energy, despite expectations of a 0.2 percent increase in both figures.

Analysts said this eases pressure on the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates and could mean a lowering of rates in the coming months.

"Today's data certainly reinforce our view that the next move from the Fed will be to ease, and we are sticking with our timeframe for a cut at the tail end of the first quarter of 2007," said Marc Levesque, chief economics strategist at TD Securities.

"The economy has slowed, and it now looks as inflation pressures are cooling down -- a trend that is also starting to materialize in the data on wages and unit labor costs."

A separate report showed US industrial production rising a better-than-expected 0.2 percent.

The latest reports were part of a string of positive economic surprises, suggesting inflation is easing but growth is holding up.

"The economy is doing very well, much better than anybody thought. The consumer is still strong and inflation is moving in the right direction," said Marc Pado at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Pado said the market was also helped by "window dressing" in which portfolio managers buy top-performing stocks before the end of the quarter to show they are holding them at the close.

"People needed to buy," he said.

Also helping sentiment was a rise in other global markets, especially in Asia, after the Tankan survey of Japanese business sentiment rose to a two-year high.

Among the gainers on Wall Street, Adobe Systems leapt 2.00 dollars, or 4.9 percent, to 42.81 dollars after the software group reported a 16 percent increase in net profits.

General Electric, the conglomerate often seen as a bellwether of the economy, advanced 1.15 dollars to 37.36.

Home Depot fell eight cents to 39.89 after the home improvement retailer announced a share buyback program.

Elsewhere, computer maker Dell lost 34 cents to 26.53 after announcing a further delay of its third-quarter results due to a regulatory inquiry.

Bonds fell, giving back early gains. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.597 percent from 4.595 percent Thursday, while that on the 30-year bond increased to 4.718 percent against 4.716 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
