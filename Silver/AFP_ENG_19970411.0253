A top aide to President Mobutu Sese Seko hit out Friday at US suggestions that the embattled Zairean leader's rule was all but over.

Honore Ngbanda Nzambo blasted Washington for trying to apply pressure on the crumbling Kinshasa regime and singled out for particular criticism comments by top US envoy George Moose which suggested that Mobutu's regime "was a thing of the past."

"What right has Mr Moose got to speak out in this way," Ngbanda told AFP by telephone from Johannesburg, where he is leading a Mobutu delegation in fledgling peace talks with rebel negotiators.

"This is no method respecting democracy which America is advocating," he said, accusing Washington of "recommending democracy and then using anti-democratic methods to get rid of someone."

"It's not up to foreign capitals to make decisions in place of Zaireans," Ngbanda said.

The United States has led calls for the ailing Mobutu to give way to democratic rule after decades of dictatorship and six months of civil war which has seen rebel forces seize almost half of the vast central African country.
