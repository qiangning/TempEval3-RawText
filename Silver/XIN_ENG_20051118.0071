Chechen Prime Minister Sergei Abramov has been admitted to a hospital in Moscow after being injured seriously in a car accident here, NTV television reported Friday.

"He is in the emergency care unit at the moment. His condition is stable," the Russian NTV television said.

Abramov's hospitalization came just days before a regional election in Chechnya, where he is the second most senior official of the restive southern Russian republic.

The accident occurred Thursday evening when the car, in which Abramov was riding on his way to the airport for a flight to Chechnya, collided with a KAMAZ truck, NTV reported.

A spokesman for the Chechen administration in Moscow, Ziyad Sabsabi, ruled out the possibility of an assassination attempt on Abramov, the Interfax news agency reported.

Abramov, who was appointed prime minister of the Russian republic in March 2004, survived a roadside bomb in July 2004, but one of his bodyguards was killed during the attack.
