Britain considered abandoning its nuclear deterrent as it cast around for ways to raise money during a humiliating economic crisis 30 years ago, newly declassified papers revealed Friday.

In 1976, the value of the pound sterling against the dollar began a slide which led ministers to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan in September.

A 3.9-billion-dollar (2.9-billion-euro) package was eventually agreed, but the image of Britain going "cap in hand" to the IMF did lasting damage to the kingdom's image around the world.

Officials and politicians considered several courses of action to ease the economic pressure, according to papers released by the National Archives in London, under rules which allow them to be made public after 30 years.

In a note marked "top secret", Sir John Hunt, who as cabinet secretary was a highly influential civil servant at the heart of government, mooted defence cuts as one possible solution if negotiations with the IMF broke down.

He wrote that he was against losing British troops stationed in West Germany to protect western Europe from the Soviet Union.

"It would be preferable, rather than cutting BAOR (the British Army of the Rhine), to look again at our eastern Atlantic contribution which involves no treaty commitment and/or the deterrent," he said in the December 1976 note.

"The Americans would strongly resist the former.

"But abandoning the deterrent, or at least scrapping its improvement, would cause much less concern to our allies."

Hunt warned that any such move "would be seen as proof of Britain's definitive disappearance as a major military power".

In September that year, Callaghan had raised the possibility that Britain would face pressure to withdraw troops from West Germany in a telephone conversation with Gerald Ford, then president of the United States.

According to a transcript, Callaghan told Ford he was "deeply concerned" about what was happening to the pound.

"If our sterling balances go and there is no protection, I can only say to you, Gerry, that we would be faced with political decisions that would change our whole attitude as a Western partner," Callaghan said.

He added that Britain was spending 600 million pounds a year in West Germany and that some might question why this should continue, given the domestic situation.

"We are putting great things at risk if this pressure on sterling continues," he added.

Britain had around 56,000 Army, 10,000 Royal Air Force and 28,000 civilian personnel committed to European mutual defence at the time.

Callaghan also sought support from the then West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt in a telephone conversation in November 1976.

Schmidt compared the economic position to "a Churchillian situation in 1940".

According to a transcript, the British premier responded: "In 1940, we got hope because the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour and it enabled us to see that in the end we would be triumphant.

"Now we've got to have the same sort of hope."

The first document gives historical perspective to the debate currently raging in Britain over the new generation of the Trident nuclear deterrent.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans for new nuclear submarines at a cost of up to 20 billion pounds (39.5 billion dollars) and a parliamentary vote on the plans is due in March 2007.
