British police were expected Monday to stage a reconstruction of the last known movements of a serial killer's victims, as they seek a breakthrough over the murders of five young prostitutes.

Detectives are also offering an amnesty for drug dealers in the quiet English town of Ipswich, in a bid to persuade them to provide information that could help in the unprecedented manhunt.

Their bodies were all found naked in countryside on the outskirts of Ipswich, 80 miles (130 kilometres) north-east of London, more than 10 days ago, sparking fears that a serial killer is on the loose.

None showed signs of having been subjected to significant trauma or serious sexual assault, fueling speculation that the killer might have been a drug dealer who doped them.

All five women were drug users and police have now offered the amnesty to local dealers in the hope that they will come forward with new information, the Times newspaper quoted the officer leading the probe as saying.

"Dealing class A drugs is a serious offence. However, our priority remains finding the person responsible for these murders ... I'm not interested in any other offences at this time," it cited police chief Stewart Gull as saying.

Officers spoke to members of the public at local rail stations Sunday night where the last known movements of one of the victims, 24-year-old Anneli Alderton, were captured on closed circuit television (CCTV).

The pictures show Alderton, who was three months pregnant, a week before the discovery of her strangled body on December 10.

Her boyfriend, Sam Jefford, 21, told the Sun newspaper that the murderer "has taken away the two most precious things in my life.

"If we were in the same room and I had a gun, I'd shoot him. It's all that he deserves."

Police also seem to compiling a database of local prostitutes' distinguishing features, including tattoos and jewellery, the Guardian reported.

An inquest into the death of one of the victims, Gemma Adams, 25, has already been opened and those of the four others -- Alderton, Tania Nicol, 19, Paula Clennell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29 -- were slated to get under way Monday.

But these were cancelled at the last minute by Suffolk Police, prompting media speculation that the investigating team needed to carry out more tests.

Nearly 10,000 calls from members of the public have been received by the investigating team, who are also trawling through 10,000 hours of CCTV footage in the hope of piecing together the final movements of all the women.

They have released footage of Nicol, as well as Alderton, and police are confident that they knew what the women were wearing when they disappeared, which would help determine where they were last seen alive.

Almost 500 officers are working in one of Britain's biggest-ever manhunts, with 350 being drafted in from 31 police forces around the country, including Northern Ireland, to help Suffolk police.

There have been no arrests and officers say that there are no suspects in the case as yet.

The case has triggered comparisons with the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, convicted of the deaths of 13 women between 1975 and 1980, and Jack the Ripper, who murdered five east London prostitutes in 1888.

Many people, especially women, in the usually quiet market town of Ipswich are terrified to go out alone at night.

The streets of the town are virtually deserted after dark, despite the Christmas party season being in full swing elsewhere in Britain.
