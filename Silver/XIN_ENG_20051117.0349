FIFA, the world soccer ruling body, will hold a seminar next week to educate South America's officials of the sport about how to use funds and facilities properly, local press said on Thursday.

Harold Mayne Nichols, the official representative of FIFA's president, will run the seminar in Venezuelan tourist resort Margarita from Tuesday to Wednesday during which officials from across South America will be taught how to make the best use of the funds provided for financial aid, sports facilities and high yielding centers across the continent.

Last month, FIFA officials inspected Margarita Island's High Yield Center; a training facility for the Venezuelan team, which received a donation from FIFA's Goal Project funding.

FIFA is paying the all the expenses of the 35 attendees to Margarita Island, so it can show off the High Yield Center, because it is a good example of what can be achieved if officials use funds properly, Mayne said.
