A taxi-driver robbed an elderly British woman of her jewelry when he took her to visit a "descendant" of Pharaoh Tutankhamun in Luxor, southern Egypt, Al-Akhbar newspaper reported Tuesday.

Morsi Bastawissi, 35, convinced the 84-year-old tourist that one of his friends was a descendant of the boy king who governed Egypt from 1354 to 1345 B.C.

He talked her into going to the descendant's home to see "the daily life of the pharaohs," but grabbed her jewelry when they arrived. The woman contacted the police, who arrested Bastawissi two hours later.
