Four US Marines are to face murder charges in connection with the killing of 24 Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha last year, the military said Thursday.

The four soldiers are among eight Marines who are to be prosecuted for their role in the killings on November last year, the most serious war crimes case involving US soldiers since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

The charges were announced at a press conference at the Marines' Camp Pendleton base outside San Diego, in southern California,

Prosecutors allege Marines went on a killing spree on November 19, 2005, shooting unarmed men, women and children after a comrade, Miguel Terrazaz, was killed by a roadside bomb while on patrol in Haditha.

Defence lawyers have said the Marines followed established war-time rules of engagement and the deaths occurred after the soldiers became embroiled in a furious firefight with insurgents.

Among those accused of murder are Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich, who led the troops from Kilo Company 3rd Battalion 1st Marine Regiment on the patrol.

Wuterich is charged with 13 counts of murder -- 12 individual counts and a separate charge relating to the death of six people.

Others accused of murder are Sergeant Sanick Dela Cruz, who faces five counts of murder, Lance Corporal Justin Sharratt, who faces three murder charges and Lance Corporal Stephen Tatum, who is charged with two murders and four counts of unlawful killing.

Four other Marines are accused of failing to properly report or investigate the killings.

Lawyers for Wuterich have said their client was following established procedure. "What Sergeant Wuterich is guilty of is serving this nation honorably and reasonably acting as he felt he was trained to do," said attorney Mark Zaid.

Initial reports of the incident from the Marines said 15 people had died in a roadside bombing. But an investigation published by Time magazine in March contradicted the official version of events.

Colonel Stewart Navarre told a press conference Thursday that the Marines' initial release was false.

"We now know with certainty the press release was incorrect, and that none of the civilians were killed by the IED explosion," Navarre said.

Witnesses and relatives accused Marines of killing Iraqis indiscriminately, accusations which led to two separate military investigations.

The first investigation focused on the events in Haditha itself while a second looked at whether military commanders attempted a cover-up.

The probe into events on the ground has found that 10 of the victims were women and children who died after being shot at close range.

The investigations also discovered that five unarmed men travelling in a taxi were shot dead as they approached the scene.

The Haditha investigation is unrelated to a separate case involving seven Marines and a Navy medic accused of kidnapping and executing an Iraqi civilian in Hamdania, west of Baghdad on April 26.

Four soldiers in the case have pleaded guilty to lesser charges while the remaining defendants are expected to face trial next year.

The Haditha and Hamdania investigations are part of a string of incidents involving the deaths of Iraqi civilians that have tarnished the reputation of US forces since the beginning of the war.
