Britain's Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 71st birthday with a quiet day at Windsor Castle Monday.

Never one to make a fuss, the queen spent the day in private with members of the royal family.

At noon in London's Hyde Park, the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun salute. An hour later, a 62-gun salute was fired by the Honourable Artillery Company at the Tower of London.

Ceremonies for the sovereign's birthday will take place this year on Saturday June 14.
