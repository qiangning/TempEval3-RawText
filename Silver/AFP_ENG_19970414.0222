A surprise fall in factory gate prices here in the month of March may mask inflationary pressures in Britain's dominant service sector, economists said on Monday.

British output prices, or the price of goods at the factory gate, showed their sharpest fall since September 1986 in March, when they fell by 0.1 percent from the figure for February. Output prices rose by 1.0 percent on a 12-month comparison, official figures showed.

These figures were slightly lower than analysts had expected. The market median forecast was for output prices to rise by 0.2 percent over the month and to rise by 1.3 percent on a 12-month comparison.

Economist at the HSBC James Capel trading house, Adam Cole, said that the data -- which is only applicable to the manufacturing sector -- covers just 20 percent of the British economy.

"The weakness of the manufacturing sector has been well documented, while it is the strength of the service sector which is giving cause for concern with regard to the build up of inflationary pressures," Cole said.

British inflation figures will be published on Thursday. Economists said that they would also pay close attention to average earnings and unemployment data which was due to be published on Wednesday.

Input prices, or the cost of raw materials for industry, showed their sharpest fall since December 1986 and fell by 0.5 percent in March from the figure for February. On a 12-month comparison, input prices fell by 7.7 percent .

The fall in prices was higher than analysts had forecast. The market median forecast was for input prices to rise by 0.3 percent over the month and to fall by 6.5 percent on a 12-month comparison.

In February, factory-gate prices had risen by 1.3 percent on a 12-month comparison. Input prices fell by 6.5 percent.
