India's new coalition government is likely to review a block on foreign airlines investing in domestic carriers, experts predicted Tuesday.

They also called for largescale investment in the industry, saying the policies carried out under the last government were out of date and anti-competition.

India's United Front coalition government was voted out of power Friday after the Congress (I) party withdrew parliamentary support.

The two former partners, however, are trying to form a new administration following the resignation of outgoing prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda as Front leader.

Prabir Das, an aviation expert for the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), blamed Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim for the block on overseas expertise and investment.

"Ibrahim's decisions were not a policy ... They were just event-based statements which would have to have a re-look.

"They never went through legislation in parliament and hence they are not law."

He added there should be a review "if India is serious in upgrading its aviation industry through resource mobilisation and foreign participation."

Ibrahim banned foreign airlines from holding equity in local carriers on April 4, five days after the coalition government lost its parliamentary majority.

He gave foreign airlines six months to withdraw investments from local carriers but allowed overseas investors outside the aviation sector to hold up to 40 percent in domestic airlines.

The guidelines, approved by Deve Gowda's cabinet, killed off a 708 -million-dollar plan by Singapore Airlines and India's Tata group to set up a new airline after more than two years of wrangling.

India's former civil aviation secretary, S.S. Sidhu, said: "The new government, in whichever form it comes, will take a look at the decisions."

An executive from the Foundation for Aviation and Sustainable Tourism said: "Instead of fishing in troubled waters, a new government should think of pragmatic policies to turn the industry into a vibrant sector."

Ibrahim has argued that investment by foreign airlines would lead to the destruction of the state-run India Airlines domestic carrier and Air India, the country's flagship airline. He allowed, however, 100 percent foreign equity in domestic airports.
