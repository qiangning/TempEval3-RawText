Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko used his troops Wednesday to stop a demonstration backing Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, even arresting him briefly, and then replaced him with an army general.

Security forces under the command of Mobutu's son, Major Mobutu Kongolo, detained Tshisekedi around midday (1000 GMT) Wednesday as he attempted to enter the prime minister's office building to begin running his new government.

A few hours later in flashes on state radio and television the government announced that Mobutu had named the defense minister in the outgoing government, General Likulia Bolongo, to be prime minister.

Mobutu declared a state of emergency Tuesday and is now running the government by decree, thus short-circuiting the constitutional debate which had pitted him in a power struggle with Tshisekedi since he appointed the long-term opposition leader premier a week ago.

Zairean journalist Michel Ladi Luya told AFP Wednesday that Mobutu was clearly trying to assert his authority in Kinshasa, and the rest of Zaire he controls, as he is on the defensive against rebels who have seized the wealthy eastern third of the central African state.

"He is trying to save his skin, by showing the the regime has not yet lost," Ladi Luya said. "He feared an uprising of the people if he did not" put on this show of force.

US officials were saying in Washington this week that Mobutu is finished and should quit but UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said rebels led by Laurent Kabila will not be able to capture the rest of Zaire.

In any case, Mobutu needs to show some strength if he is to hope win something in talks that have already started between his regime and the rebels.

Officials from Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progess (UNDP) party told AFP Wednesday that they would continue to demonstrate but did not say what their strategy would be. They said they saw themselves as allies, albeit non-violent, of Kabila.

In Wednesday's demonstration, troops sealed off access to the parliament office building, and Tshisekedi's car was stopped at a crossroads about one kilometre (half a mile) away, with thousands of people gathered around it.

He got out of the light brown Peugeot 405 and was walking towards the office building when he was arrested. At first he was surrounded by some 30 armed civil guard troops who were protecting him. Behind him stretched the huge crowd.

But troops from the elite Special Presidential Divison (DSP) plowed into the crowd in armored cars, hitting Tshisekedi's car, and troops behind them fired tear gas. The crowd began to disperse and the civil guards who were with Tshisekedi fled.

Tshisekedi, making the V victory sign with his fingers, still advanced however and a line of troops guarding the prime minister's offices shot in the air as he approached.

He kept coming, along with some 50 supporters, and troops finally grabbed him, threw him into a four-wheel drive jeep and took him away.

Earlier, soldiers charged and tear-gassed a crowd of around 1,000 people who had gathered outside the prime minister's house to accompany him to his offices in a planned mass march.

Tshisekedi has angered both opposition parties and pro-Mobutu groups by declaring Mobutu's regime illegitimate.

Mobutu Kongolo brought Tshisekedi, after he had been detained home to his residence, an official said.
