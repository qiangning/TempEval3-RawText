The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Nepali government began conducting census of the approximately 106,000 Bhutanese refugees in eastern Nepal on Wednesday.

According to the UN refugee agency, the joint government-UN census started earlier Wednesday at 10:00 local time (0415 GMT) from the Beldagi-1 camp in Illam district.

The census will be collecting all relevant details from refugees living in the seven camps in Jhapa and Morang districts.

According to a statement from the UNHCR, the census team was made up of UNHCR-trained persons who will conduct the interviews in close co-operation and collaboration with the officials of the Nepali government to both count and update basic bio-data and profile of the refugees.

The refugee agency's newly developed progress software will be used to log an accurate record of the number of refugees and to collect other related information.

Previously, UNHCR representative in Nepal, Abraham Abraham, said that a reliable census data would help the Nepal government and UNHCR to provide better protection, security and support to the refugees on the basis of improved documentation on "who is who " and "who is where" to be able to respond to individual needs.

Some 106,000 Bhutanese refugees have been living in seven camps in eastern Nepal for the last 16 years.

As many as 15 rounds of bilateral talks held between the two governments have failed to yield any results so far.
