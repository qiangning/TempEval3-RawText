Turkey will be seeking its first win in history against world champion Italy at a friendly in Bergamo Wednesday night, Turkish Daily News reported.

The game will be played in honor of Giacinto Facchetti, former skipper of the Italian national team, who died in September.

In the past 12 matches against the Azzurri, three of them with B teams, Turkey has lost nine and drawn three, scoring seven goals and conceding 22.

Their last clash was a friendly in Pescara four years ago, where midfielder Emre Belozoglu and striker Christian Vieri scored one each in a 1-1 draw.

Turkey coach Fatih Terim knows all about Italian soccer, having spent time in charge of Serie A clubs AC Milan and Fiorentina.

Terim has called up veteran striker Hakan Sukur to the squad, despite speculation after his last appearance that he would retire.

Newcastle United's Belozoglu, who still has one official match ban to serve, is also expected to play. Schalke 04 midfielder Hamit Altintop suffered a minor injury in his team's 4-0 win over Mainz on Sunday and whether he can play will be known today.

Ankaragucu goalkeeper Serkan Kirintili received his first call-up to the national squad.

Turkey has not conceded a single goal in its last four matches against opponents incomparable with Italy. Wednesday's match will be a tough test for Terim and his players ahead of the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Greece and Norway in March 2007.
