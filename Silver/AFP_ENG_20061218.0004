Aides of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and officials of his governing Labour Party are under investigation for obstructing the "cash-for-honours" probe, The Times reported in its Monday edition.

The report comes after Blair last Thursday became the first serving prime minister to have been questioned as part of a criminal inquiry in what critics said was an embarrassment to the British leader.

According to the newspaper, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has told police that they should look into the fact that some e-mails and documents have not yet been handed over, while others have apparently disappeared.

"There is more than a suspicion that evidence has not been handed over, people have colluded and the police are not being helped," an unidentified prosecution source told the newspaper.

"What these people should remember is that they are not dealing with a parliamentary inquiry; this is a criminal investigation and anyone failing to co-operate is participating in a criminal offence," the source said.

According to The Times, the possibility of charges of perverting the course of justice was discussed by CPS lawyers after they met with the police. The charge carries a maximum life sentence.

Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported that Lord Michael Levy -- Blair's Middle East envoy and Labour's main fundraiser, dubbed "Lord Cashpoint" -- was understood to be the focus of the police investigation into the issue.

The business daily reported that detectives may soon interview Levy for a third time.

Police are investigating claims that seats in the House of Lords, the unelected upper house of parliament, were offered in return for financial help to political parties, including Labour since it became the party of government in 1997, in breach of the 1925 Honours (Prevention of Abuse) Act.

They are also considering whether there was any breach of the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 which requires donations and non-commercial loans to parties to be publicly declared.

Critics of the government also pointed out, according to The Guardian, that it seemed to be contradicting previous statements in its response to the investigation -- Blair said earlier that he nominated four Labour Party donors for "expressly party peerages, given for party service".

Their citation documents, however, which were printed in the Independent on Sunday, make no mention of their links to the party, and instead speak of their business and other experience.

John Yates, the Metropolitan Police officer leading the investigation into allegations of "cash for honours", said last month that detectives had conducted 90 interviews.

Of these, 35 were linked to the governing Labour Party, 29 to the main opposition Conservatives and four to the Liberal Democrats, Britain's third biggest party.

A further 22 were non-party interviews.
