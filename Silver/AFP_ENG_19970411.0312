A Malaysian opposition leader Friday called for the resignation of a high-ranking Malaysian politician charged with attempting to take undeclared currency out of Australia.

Muhammad bin Muhammad Taib, chief minister of Malaysia's central state of Selangor, was earlier Friday ordered by an Australian court to attend a three-day committal hearing beginning August 19.

Muhammad, 51, who was not required to attend the court hearing Friday, was charged with failing to declare the equivalent of 2.4 million ringgit (981,000 US) in December 1996.

Under Australian law it is an offence to carry more than 5,000 dollars in cash into or out of the country without declaring it.

Parliamentary opposition Lim Kit Siang called on Muhammad to "resign or take immediate long leave until the outcome of the court proceedings in August."

"If Muhammad loves Malaysia, he should resign as Selangor chief minister to end the enormous embarassment he is causing the nation with endless international reports about his vast wealth," Lim said in a statement.

"Malaysia must not be put through another four month's agony and international embarrassment over his 2.4-million-ringgit cash caper in Brisbane and frequent reports about his Australian properties," he said.

"The reports not only embarass Malaysia but reinforces international perceptions that the anti-corruption agency (ACA) is impotent when faced with corruption in high political places," he added.

Muhammad had said the undeclared money was entrusted to him by his three brothers to buy property in Brisbane's Gold Coast but Australian newspaper alleged he owned multi-million-dollar properties in the country.

ACA officials on Tuesday flew to Brisbane to probe allegations of Muhammad's property investments in Australia including a two-million- ringgit (800,000-dollar) house and various properties.

Muhammad was about to board a flight to New Zealand on December 23 last year when a customs official opened his suitcase and allegedly discovered the cash in Malaysian, Singaporean and New Zealand currency.

Muhammad, who is also the vice-president of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ruling UMNO party, came into the limelight six years ago when he incurred the wrath of the Selangor sultan by secretly marrying his second daughter, Princess Zahariah Sallahuddin.
