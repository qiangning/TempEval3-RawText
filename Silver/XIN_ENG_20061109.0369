Defending champions Al-Ahly's coach is facing huge pressure before a decisive game with Sfaxien of Tunisia on Saturday in the second and decisive leg of the Champions League final.

Ahly's Portuguese coach Manuel Jose has thrown all his cards into the fray and is waiting for a royal flush, local English newspaper The Daily Star reported on Thursday.

Earlier this week, the Egyptian Football Association agreed to postpone Ahly's game with Giza-based Enppi in order to give the "Red Devil" players enough rest before their away game with Sfaxien.

Ahly, however, were held to a 1-1 draw with Sfaxien on Oct. 29 in the first leg of the African Champions League final.

Owing to the draw, Ahly's home advantage was wasted and its hopes to win a second successive African Champions League title received a big blow.

Despite the urging of local experts that the game would have been a good way to prepare and get in form for the Nov. 11 game with Sfaxien, Jose pushed to get his way and will likely be held accountable should the Egyptians come home empty-handed.

But there is another aspect to consider -- Ahly, Egypt's best soccer club based in Cairo, needs a serious morale booster.

Moreover both Zamalek and Ismailia, Ahly's main competitors in the Egyptian league, failed to win their games this week. Had Ahly played and won this week, the team would have jumped up to second place in the league standings, only one point behind Ismailia and ahead of Zamalek.

With three postponed games still in hand for Ahly, such a scenario could have certainly boosted the team's morale before their Saturday game.

The 1-1 draw with Sfaxien on Oct. 29 was deemed unforgivable by Ahly club senior members and by the 85,000 fans that attended the game.

The Portuguese coach also suspended midfielder Hassan Mostafa before game one and Ahly's midfield has clearly been hurt on both the offensive and defensive fronts.

The embattled coach is clearly firing all guns.

He announced after the poor showing in the first leg of the final that he is the person responsible for Ahly's achievements in the past few years.

In spite of all this, the Egyptian press and Ahly's management sound relatively supportive of the coach and the players. This will certainly not be the case if the cards fail Jose on Nov. 11.

Ahly, considered by some as the best club in Africa, won the African Champions League four times, in 1982, 1987, 2001 and 2005, respectively.

Sfaxien handed Ahly their first continental defeat in two years on July 15 when they beat them 1-0 in Sfax in the opening game of their quarter-finals Group A matches.

But Ahly returned the favor by winning the second match at home 2-1.
