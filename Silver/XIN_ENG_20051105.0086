A last-gasp header by defender Du Wei earned China a 2-1 victory over Japan Saturday in the men's soccer semifinals at the East Asian Games.

China will face the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Sunday's final. The DPR Koreans downed South Korea 2-0 in the other semifinal.

Just as the match looked set for a 1-1 draw in regulation time, Du rose unmarked in the penalty box to head home a free-kick from midfielder Sun Xiang one minute into injury time.

China opened the scoring in the 41st minute with a header by striker Gao Lin, but the Japanese grabbed the equalizer through Shingo Akamine's header 15 minutes after halftime.

Earlier in the group stage, DPR Korea defeated China 3-1.
