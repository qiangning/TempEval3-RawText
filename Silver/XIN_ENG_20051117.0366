A Hungarian film won the grand prix of the 27th Noordeljik Film Festival in the Netherlands, local media reported Thursday.

"Porcelain Doll," directed by Peter Gardos, is based on three short stories, focusing on death, resurrection and vulnerability in the history of the 20th century.

Adapted from Star Farm, a book of short stories by Hungarian writer Ervin Lazar, the three distinct fairy tales of "Porcelain Doll" concern the supernatural occurrences that arise when a community of Hungarian farmers is visited by the forces of state power.

The film had its world premiere at the Moscow Film Festival in June, and was given the Russian film critics' award. It has also received the Gene Moskowitz Award of foreign critics.
