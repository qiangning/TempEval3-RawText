The Turkish contingent of the multinational force in Albania will provide security for Tirana airport, the foreign ministry said here Tuesday.

"It has been decided at the Albania force meetings in Rome that the Turkish contingent will be deployed in Tirana and be responsible for the security of the airport and the city's northwestern sector," the ministry said in a statement.

The Turkish contingent of nearly 800 troops, is due to reach Albania by April 24 and become operational the following day, ministry officials said.

The United Nations last month approved the creation of an Italian-led multinational force of 6,000 troops to be deployed in rebellion-hit Albania, to provide security for humanitarian aid efforts.
