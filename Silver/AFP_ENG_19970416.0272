Delighted Indian industry chiefs Wednesday predicted the newly- announced cut in interest rates and relaxation of lending rules would spark growth as businesses revived expansion plans.

A.S. Kasliwal, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, was responding after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Tuesday announced a one-percent interest rate cut to 11 percent in its monetary policy for the six months to September.

It also relaxed rules on bank lending to companies.

"The policy will give the banking sector freedom and flexibility to meet credit requirements of the productive sector," he said.

Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president Shekhar Dutta also welcomed the RBI's new policy, saying it would "broaden and deepen the financial and capital market reforms.

"The policy reflects the continuation and direction of economic reforms and the measures announced will propel the pace and momentum of growth.

"The reduction of lending rate by one percent will reduce the cost of borrowing and help reduce project costs," the CII chief added.

The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry said the RBI policy "will give a boost to the capital market."

All-India Association of Industries president Vijay Kalantri added: "Freedom to banks to assess potential borrowers ... will benefit the commercial sector."

The RBI allowed banks more independence in giving credit and permitted them to extend loans to firms against their shares.

Commercial banks are expected to match the RBI's rate cut by reducing their prime lending and term deposit rates.

A national forum of banking executives, however, went againsts the trend by warning Wednesday the relaxed rules could lead to more bad loans being made.

All India Bank Officers Confederation secretary R.C. Agarwal added the RBI had restricted freedom of domestic banks following a multi- billion-dollar securities scandal in 1992.

Nine Indian and foreign banks were held responsible for artifically jacking up share prices with borrowed funds.

The RBI said Tuesday the aim of its policy was to "maintain a monetary expansion of 15 to 15.5 percent with the expectation of bringing down the interest rate to a reasonable level."
