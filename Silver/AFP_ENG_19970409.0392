The Haitian Chamber of Deputies has authorized some units of the national police to carry light weapons in addition to their sidearms, parliamentary sources said Wednesday.

The move is a reaction to rising violence, especially in Haiti's urban areas. Eight policemen have been gunned down in recent weeks.

The parliamentary list of authorized weapons includes submachine guns and assault rifles. Until now, police have carried only Smith and Wesson .38-caliber handguns.
