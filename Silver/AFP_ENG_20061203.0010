The presidential candidate of France's Socialist Party, Segolene Royal, arrived in Israel Sunday, three days after kicking off a Middle East tour in neighboring Lebanon.

Royal, who is aiming to become France's first woman head of state, will be going "to make the necessary contacts," party spokesman Julien Dray had told French radio station Europe 1 last week.

Her trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories was to show her support for "dialogue," Dray said.

"She wants to show that her presidency will be effective and useful for our fellow citizens and for peace in the world," he said.

The spokesman added, however, that a visit to Syria during the trip "was not on the agenda".

A top Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity has said that Royal was expected in Israel for a 48-hour stay.

She was due to meet with Palestinian youths at the French cultural center in Gaza City Sunday morning and hold talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.

In the late afternoon Royal was expected to meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni.

A meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz was scheduled for Monday.

Royal, 53, is currently leading in polls in France ahead of the presidential elections to be held in April.

French President Jacques Chirac, who turned 74 on Wednesday, is considered unlikely to seek a third term in office.
