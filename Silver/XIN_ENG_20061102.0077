More than 60,000 Afghans in Pakistan have so far been registered since the largest ever registration has been started on Oct. 15, the UN refugee agency said on Thursday.

Pakistan had launched the registration process in collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the process would be completed by the end of this year, Pakistan news agency NNI reported.

Senior Regional Public Information Officer of UNHCR Vivian Tan said that UNHCR is trying to give identification to Afghan refugees and their registration process would be completed by the end of year.

She said it is a wrong perception that process of registration of Afghan refugees will be used for expelling Afghan refugee from Pakistan.

She said that the basic purpose of the registration process is to protect Afghan refugees from harassment as after the registration Afghan refugees could legally stay for three years in Pakistan and they could obtain passports and identity cards to prove their identification.

She said that it is true that Afghan refugees are afraid of the registration process and they do not want to do so but the UNHCR is trying to convince them for registration.

She said that it is true that the UNHCR is lacking fund for completion of the registration process but the donors have pledged to provide more funds.

She said that 1 million Afghan refugees have been staying in 74 camps in Pakistan, mostly in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and southwestern Balochistan province.

She said that they would ask Pakistan government to set up more registration centers outside Islamabad, adding that the meeting is scheduled to be held in December to review the registration process.

She said, "We are giving them 12 U.S. dollars per person going back to Afghanistan with a traveling allowance of four to 37 dollars according to their distance."

It is true that most of the Afghan refugees are coming back to Pakistan but there is no way to document the record of these people, said Van.

"We have always stressed the need of development in Afghanistan so that these people could stay in their country," she added.
