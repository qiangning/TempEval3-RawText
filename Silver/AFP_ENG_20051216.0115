DaimlerChrysler, the German-US auto giant, plans to axe several thousand more jobs on top of the recent job cuts announced at its prestigious Mercedes brand, the regional daily Stuttgarter Zeitung reported on Friday.

DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board was scheduled to examine a working paper drawn up by the management board that entailed big job cuts between 2006 and 2008, the newspaper said, without revealing its sources.

However, a formal decision was not expected to be announced after the meeting, it added.

DaimlerChrysler was not immediately available to comment on the report.

But the car maker recently embarked on a restructuring at its Mercedes division that would entail the loss of 8,500 jobs in Germany over the next 12 months.

Stuttgarter Zeitung said the new job cuts would affect the heavy trucks divsion, which has hitherto been spared any blood-letting.
