Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on Monday urged Israel to respond to the international peace efforts to make the Middle East a peaceful, secure and stable region.

Israel's withdrawal from Gaza is a right step forward, Ben Ali said in a letter to the United Nations on the occasion of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.

He hoped that Israel's pullout from Gaza would be the beginning of its withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories so that Middle East peoples can live in peace with one another.

The president called on all relevant parties, especially the mediating Quartet to implement the roadmap peace plan in earnest and push forward the Middle East peace process in accordance with relevant UN resolutions.

Ben Ali also reiterated support for the Palestinian people's efforts to restore their national dignity and establish an independent state of their own.

A UN resolution adopted in 1977 designated Nov. 29 as the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.
