There are up to 2.1 million problem drug users in the European Union (EU) today, of whom over 1 million are likely to be drug injectors, said Europe's drugs monitoring center on Thursday.

Around 9 million Europeans, or three percent of all adults, have used cocaine at some stage in their lives. Some 2.6 million adults in the EU have used ecstasy recently, said the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drugs Addiction in its 2005 report.

Over 62 million Europeans, or over 20 percent of all adults, have ever tried cannabis and around 20 million -- six percent of all adults -- have used it in the last 12 months, said the report.
