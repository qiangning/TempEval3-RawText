China launched an information security certification center in Beijing on Friday.

"A national standard on security products will take effect following the establishment of the center and some products will be subject to compulsory certification," said Qu Weizhi, deputy director of the Information Office under the State Council.

Information security has become a serious problem in China with the rapid growth of the information industry. Crimes through the Internet, computer viruses and junk mail has threatened security.

"Some departments have set up systems on evaluation, licensing or purchase of security products but a unified national system is required to avoid repetition," said Qu.

Apart from certification of security products, the center would also conduct talents training and technology research and development on information security.

China boasts the world second largest population of netizens behind the United States, exceeding 123 million last July.
