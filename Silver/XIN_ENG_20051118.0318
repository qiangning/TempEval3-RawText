LONDON, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) - Newcastle United manager Graeme Souness has warned his players that Chelsea would recover from the previous loss in the English premier league to become a "dangerous animal".

Chelsea are still leading the Premier League table despite their 1-0 loss to Manchester United following a Champions League defeat by Real Betis.

"Chelsea lost the last game they played and for me when this happens to any team it makes them a dangerous animal," Souness told reporters on Friday.

"We are playing against a team that is successful and used to winning, a team that has had a bit of criticism of late and all those things make them dangerous,"added the manager, whose side will visit Chelsea on Saturday.

Newcastle will be without skipper Alan Shearer following a hernia operation, leaving striker Michael Owen to spearhead the Newcastle attack.

"What we are hoping for is that they have a hangover of some sort and we are resilient and one of our special players can do something on the day," said Souness.

Following a poor start in the season, Newcastle stand 10th on the league table, 13 points behind Chelsea.
