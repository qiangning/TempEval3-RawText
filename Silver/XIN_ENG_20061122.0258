Serbian President Boris Tadic went home from a hospital on Wednesday following a gall bladder operation, his office said.

Tadic, 48-year-old, was feeling well after undergoing surgery at Belgrade's Military Academy Hospital on Monday, said the office, adding that Tadic would remain at home for several days.

Elected as president in 2004, Tadic will face a crucial test as he is leading the pro-Western Democratic Party to contest the parliamentary elections scheduled for Jan. 21 next year.

In 2004, Tadic was hospitalized for more than two weeks with a lung infection.
