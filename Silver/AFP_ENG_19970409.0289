A 24-strong advance party of the multinational force for Albania has arrived in the capital Tirana to scout installations where the force could be billetted, officials said Wednesday.

The mission includes 13 Italians, despite political uncertainty in Rome over whether Italy's leadership of the force will get the required backing of parliament in a vote which was to be held later Wednesday.

The advance team arrived in Tirana late Tuesday.

The experts Wednesday began assessing the suitability of barracks and other centres which are to be used to house the 6,000-strong multinational force.

The Albanian authorities are proposing that the force headquarters be in a military school in Tirana, one of the military experts said.

Intensive renovation work has been carried out in recent weeks in government-controlled towns to restore military installations ransacked during riots sparked by the collapse of phoney investment schemes.

The force will have to cope with widespread lawlessness, with large areas of the country, particularly in the south, controlled by armed gangs.

Apart from the Italians, the advance contingent is made up of three French, three Greeks, two Danes, two Spaniards and a Romanian.

Eight European countries have pledged troops for the force, the first contingents of which are due to land in the port of Durres within days.

One hundred and twenty men of the French contingent left Toulon on the Mediterranean coast overnight on the troop transport vessel Champlain, the French military press service SIRPA said Wednesday.

Another 350 men will embark Thursday and 600 others on Tuesday.

The troops are expected to arrive in Durres two or three days later.

The French contingent has been tasked with making Durres port and the Durres-Tirana road safe.

In a related development, Albanian Defense Minister Shaqir Vukaj said the multinational force would not face a civil-war situation in Albania.

"The only existing threat comes from criminal armed gangs which under the prevailing conditions unfortunately organize rapidly, while the Albanian people, from north to south, will welcome the multinational force," said Vukaj after talks with his Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos in Athens.

Vukaj said that Greek would help in rebuilding the Albanian armed forces.
