The iconic photograph of China's most prestigious charity program - Project Hope - was the most expensive picture sold at China's first photography auction held in Beijing on Thursday.

The 1991 photograph, popularly known as Big Eyes, captures the innocent eyes of a girl and is credited with persuading millions of Chinese to donate to Project Hope which helps school drop-outs in rural areas to return to class.

Bidding on the 51 cm by 34.8 cm photograph by Xie Hailong opened at 240,000 yuan (30,000 U.S. dollars). It finally sold for 308,000 yuan (38,500 U.S. dollars), the highest price paid at the Beijing auction, where more than 130 photographs were sold.

Xie said he would donate the proceeds to help pay for the construction of a Project Hope primary school in Tibet.

Many of the other photographs sold for 10 times more than their reserve prices.

"Photographs worth collecting should be of special significance and be a record of history," said Xu Jianing, an official with the auction house -- Huachen Auctions.
