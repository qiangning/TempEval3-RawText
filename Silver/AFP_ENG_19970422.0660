President Alberto Fujimori took a victory lap of the grounds of the Japanese embassy residence Tuesday, embracing security forces after they ended a protracted hostage standoff.

Under an hour after about 100 camouflage-clad troops stormed the building where Marxist rebels holed up for more than four months with 72 prominent hostages, Fujimori, wearing a bullet-proof vest and white shirtsleeves, was in a distinctly celebratory mood.

After the gunshots, explosions and fire, military marches were blaring, special forces cheered and shouted "We have won!" and "Long Live Peru" as Fujimori pressed military flesh and enjoyed a round of hugs, before entering the residence.

His own brother Pedro Fujimori was among the hostages, who were thought to have been freed safely. Peruvian media said all hostages were freed safely but that report had yet to be confirmed.

The number of rebel casualties was not immediately known and several troops were injured and taken to hospital.
