US President Bill Clinton walked a delicate line Friday as he met Hong Kong's Democratic party chief amid warnings from the territory's future China-appointed leader about meddling in the upcoming handover.

The White House downgraded the talks with Martin Lee to a casual drop- in by Clinton in order to avoid angering China, which views Lee's visit as an attempt to win Washington's sympathies to his protests over the July 1 takeover of Hong Kong.

But Hong Kong's chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa said he was "disappointed" with Lee Friday and warned him "to please bear in mind that whatever he says it will be carefully read and interpreted.

"The worst thing is, at this juncture, to give people in the United States a wrong impression. So far I have to tell you I am disappointed," he said.

Lee said at the UN headquarters in New York Tuesday that he plans to press Clinton to consider the transition of Hong Kong as an "international" affair rather than the domestic matter China insists it is.

In a specially choreographed arrangement, Vice President Al Gore held an official meeting with Lee which Clinton visited while it was "in progress," the White House said.

But China's kid glove treatment by the White House also comes with a warning.

Thursday, spokesman Michael McCurry said that the US administration will watch the handover anxiously and be ready to pounce on any sign that democratic freedoms are being yanked.

He evoked the 1984 Joint Declaration agreement between Britain and China which calls for the continuation of civil rights in the former British colony and said: "We will assert an interest in preserving that formula into the future."

The United States has already protested China's plans to dissolve the elected legislature and its proposals to clamp down on freedoms of expression and assembly.

As part of the US vigilance, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will attend the ceremony for the transition of Hong Kong, where there are 40,000 American citizens and some 13 billion dollars in investments.

Clinton agreed to the Lee meeting after pressure from the Republican- led Congress, which is highly supportive of the Hong Kong Democratic leader and often charges the president's handling of China is weak- kneed.

The "drop-by" formula is one often used by the White House in delicate diplomatic situations.

If the Dalai Lama comes to the White House as expected, McCurry said he will likely be greeted here as he was last year.

"In the past, it's been similar to the procedure for Lee today," he said.

Tung said Wednesday that he had scrapped plans to visit the United States.

Media reports in Hong Kong said it was to avoid possible embarrassment should he be refused a White House visit.

McCurry declined to comment on whether the president would meet with Tung, saying that as there were no plans for his visit such meeting would be hypothetical.
