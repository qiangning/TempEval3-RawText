Current world No. 1 Lin Dan of China was ousted from the men's singles competition at the China Open badminton here on Friday.

Lin Dan lost to his teammate Chen Hong, another china top player, in straight sets 15-5, 15-8.

Both of them were not amazed to see the result, "Today Lin Dan is out of order," Chen said, "That's why I won the game."

"We know each other very much, and his style is not secret to me, which is another reason I beat him,"Chen said.

Although losing the match surprised the spectators, Lin seemed still relaxed after the match.

"Actually winning or losing is not very important for me, now I focus on adapting to new 21-point rule settled by International Badminton which will change the traditional 15-point set."

Chen Hong next will clash with sixth-seeded Peter Gade of Denmark in the semifinals, and China's 19-year-old young player Chen Jin will face his teammate, third-seeded Bao Chunlai.
