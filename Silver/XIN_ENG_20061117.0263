Russia is open for cooperation with the APEC members in energy security, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a written interview published on the presidential official website on Friday.

"As one of the leading providers of energy to global markets, Russia is open for cooperation in this sphere. We deem it important in this respect to establish mutually beneficial conditions for partnership," Putin said ahead of the 14th APEC ( Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit meeting in Hanoi.

"They should be based on mutual responsibility of producers and users of energy resources, fair distribution of risks between them, the exchange of assets in the energy sector," he added.

According to Putin, a plan of action adopted at the Group of Eight summit in St. Petersburg this July "envisages measures for increasing transparency, predictability and stability of energy markets, and improving the investment climate as a whole."

Besides, "it is important to develop energy-saving technology and diversify types of energy and routes of its transportation." Substantial steps are also "needed in such directions as ensuring energy infrastructure security, overcoming energy poverty and solving ecological problems."

All these issues are especially important "considering the growing need for creating in the Asia Pacific Region a new, more reliable energy configuration. Russia is ready to actively participate in the implementation of this large-scale initiative," Putin said.

"Moreover, we are going to propose and implement several concrete infrastructure projects. The talk is about the construction of oil and gas pipelines for delivery of carbohydrates to the Asia Pacific Region from the eastern part of our country," Putin said.

Founded in 1989, APEC is a major regional forum acting as the primary regional vehicle for promoting open trade and practical economic and technical cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

It represents the most economically dynamic region in the world, with its 21 member economies accounting for more than one third of the world's population, approximately 60 percent of world GDP, and about 47 percent of world trade.
