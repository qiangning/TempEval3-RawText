Australia won the toss and elected to bat in the first Test against South Africa at the Western Australian Cricket Association Ground here Friday.

For South Africa, star allrounder Jacques Kallis was left out of the side after failing a last-minute fitness test on his injured left elbow. It is the first time in two years that Kallis has missed a Test match.

"Though Jacques made significant progress, it was not enough to make him eligible for selection in the Test match," team physiotherapist Shane Jabbar said.

Captain Graeme Smith said the team was upbeat, despite Kallis' loss.

"The team is pretty confident, it hasn't unsettled us much," he said.

Jacques Rudolph was brought in as the number three batsman with captain Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers to open the batting for the Proteas.

Australia have named seamer Nathan Bracken in their bowling attack.

Light drizzle was falling at the ground but was forecast to clear later in the day.

The wicket, known for its pace, had a light cover of grass and the overcast conditions were expected to be good for bowling.

Teams:

South Africa: Graeme Smith (c), AB de Villiers, Jacques Rudolph, Herschelle Gibbs, Ashwell Prince, Justin Kemp, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Charl Langeveldt, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel, Garnett Kruger (12th man).

Australia: Ricky Ponting (c), Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Brad Hodge, Mike Hussey, Andrew Symonds, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Brett Lee, Nathan Bracken, Glenn McGrath, Stuart Clark (12th man).
