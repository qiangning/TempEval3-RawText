More than 500,000 Dutch tulips will deck out a park next to Beijing's Tiananmen Square from April 12, China's official Xinhua news agency reported Thursday.

The tulips, provided by the Dutch Euro-Asia Flower Group, will be arranged in ten large floral mozaics in Zhongshan park and are aimed at giving Beijingers a taste of the Netherlands in Spring.

The one-month display will also feature 6,000 blooming peonies, azaleas, and orchids.
