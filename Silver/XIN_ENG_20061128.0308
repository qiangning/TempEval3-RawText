The Chinese government has approved price rises by the State Post Bureau for mail and postcard deliveries.

The State Development and Reform Commission (SDRC) and the State Post Bureau announced the price hikes from Nov. 15.

China's law on pricing requires government departments to hold hearings on price hikes for any public services, but the postal prices would not be subject to a hearing, said an SDRC official.

The cost of posting a postcard rose from 0.6 yuan (0.08 U.S. dollars) to 0.8 yuan, while the local rate for a letter rose from 0.6 yuan to 0.8 yuan per 20 grams for the first 100 grams and 1.2 yuan for each additional 100 grams.

For ordinary domestic letters, the price rose from 0.8 yuan to 1.2 yuan per 20 grams for the first 100 grams. Charges for each additional 100 grams remain two yuan.

Figures provided by the SDRC show the per capita cost of the increase is 0.33 yuan per year, so a hearing would have been unreasonable, the official said.

The increase is aimed at alleviating the service's financial problems and paving the way for its transformation into a state-owned enterprise, an SDRC spokesperson had said earlier.

Postal charges were last raised in 1998.
