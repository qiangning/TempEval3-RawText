Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib held talks on Saturday with visiting Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Sultanov, stressing the importance of supporting efforts to settle the Palestinian issue, the official Petra news agency reported.

Al-Khatib urged the International Quartet on the Middle East, which groups the United Nations, the United States, Russia and the European Union, to make more efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region.

He expressed his appreciation for the expected visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Jordan next February.

During the meeting, Sultanov talked about Putin's initiative to hold an international conference to settle the Palestinian issue.

Al-Khatib said Jordan had a positive view on the initiative and an initiative announced by France, Spain and Italy.

"Such initiatives reflect the world's interest in the situation in the region and the willingness of the international community to contribute to finding a just and comprehensive solution for the Palestinian cause," said al-Khatib.
