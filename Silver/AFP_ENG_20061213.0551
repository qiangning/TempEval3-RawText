The United States and Britain are considering the imposition of a no-fly zone over Sudan's war-torn Darfur region if the Khartoum government does not allow a UN-led peacekeeping force into the area, the State Department said Wednesday.

Blair raised the no-fly zone option during a meeting here last week with US President George W. Bush amid growing frustration with Sudan's refusal to comply with agreements on the peacekeepers, department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
