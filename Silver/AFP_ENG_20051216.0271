Britain was to present new proposals Friday aimed at breaking the EU's budget deadlock, a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said, reporting "progress" in talks at a crunch Brussels summit.

"At some stage this afternoon we will put down a negotiating box," said spokesman Tom Kelly, using EU-speak for a package of complex proposals seeking to resolve differences over the 2007-13 budget.

"There has been progress this morning," he said, with Blair reporting back to a lunchtime session of all 25 EU leaders on the progress made in a series of bilateral talks during the morning.

More bilateral talks were likely after the round-table session, he added, after which the new proposals -- the third in two weeks -- will be put to the member states.

Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn also sounded an upbeat note. "I feel, everyone feels in the building that the English ... are taking steps in the right direction, but they need to be concrete," he said.

The budget, worth nearly 850 billion euros (1.01 trillion dollars), is vital to releasing much-needed funds to the relatively poorer ex-communist states from central and eastern Europe which joined the bloc last year.

Holding up a deal, however, are two issues: Britain's refusal to part with its budget rebate, secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, and French resistance to reforming farm subsidies which eat up 42 percent of EU spending.

Blair, chairing the final summit of Britain's turn at the EU presidency, huddled with several fellow leaders earlier Friday, following up on a working dinner the night before where blunt talking was on the menu.

His final meeting before lunch Friday saw him with French President Jacques Chirac, who wants the rebate to go, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose nation is the biggest contributor to EU coffers.

"The important thing this morning was that serious efforts are being made all around to try and find a way forward," the prime minister's spokesman told reporters.

"That doesn't guarantee success, but it underlines that people are serious about trying to get a deal at this summit."
