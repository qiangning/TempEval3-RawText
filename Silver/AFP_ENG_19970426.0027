Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has issued a directive calling on all levels of government to tighten vigilance against revealing state secrets, reports said Saturday.

According to the April 24 directive, portions of which were published in all daily Vietnamese-language newspapers, "the situation of revealing state secrets in a number of offices and localities is still serious," the Communist party's official mouthpiece Nhan Dan said.

The paper quoted the government as saying that since 1991 when the ordinance on Protection of State Secrets was issued much progress had been made, but there were "cases of abusing regulations on state secret protection."

Vietnam has nebulous laws on state security and press freedom that give the government a free hand in restricting the media. The laws allow for criminal prosecution and harsh prison terms for those who reveal state secrets or damage national interests.

The directive did not provide any list or description of what was included under state secrets.

Instead it called on "ministries, offices of ministerial level, government offices and People's Committees of provinces and cities under central authority to submit lists of state secrets to be approved by the prime minister before the third quarter of 1997," the paper said.

The directive also said the Ministry of Culture and Information needed to regulate news reporting in the press in order "to ensure both the spread of information to the public and the correct implementation of regulations on preserving state secrets."

The government has closed several newspapers in the past to punish them for their reporting. Though there are more than 500 journals and periodicals, the Vietnamese media is state-owned and subject to severe limitations on freedom of speech.

Last month the ministry of culture and information and the State Bank issued a circular aimed at curbing and controlling local media coverage of the banking industry, which included a list of information considered as state secrets in that industry.

Information is tightly controlled in Vietnam, and statistics jealously guarded. Economic data considered routine in other countries, such as the size of the government budget deficit, are not publicly known.

Last year several local journalists were investigated for revealing "national secrets in violation of Article 97 of the criminal code," after reporting possible mishandling of aircraft purchases by Vietnam Airlines.
