Mario Scaramella, an Italian contact of dead former Russian ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, was admitted to hospital on Friday after tests detected radioactive polonium 210 in his body, a University College Hospital spokesman said.

"Tests have detected polonium 210 in Mr Scaramella's body but at a considerably lower level than Mr Litvinenko," the spokesman added.

"He is currently well and shows no symptoms of radiation poisoning. He is receiving further tests over the weekend."
