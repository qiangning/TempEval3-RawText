The non-performing loan volume in China's banking industry could rebound despite its recent decline, says a senior official with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).

Jiang Dingzhi, vice-chairman of the China's banking industry watchdog, told the 10th Annual CEO Forum sponsored by Business Weekly that reforms of commercial banks should be deepened to establish a mature corporate governing structure.

The volume of non-performing loans was still large and under greater pressure of rebounding, said Jiang.

According to CBRC statistics, by the end of September, non-performing loans in major commercial banks were 1.2 trillion yuan (150 billion U.S. dollars), 46.9 billion yuan less than the beginning of this year.

The non-performing loan ratio had dropped by 1.3 percentage points from the beginning of this year to 7.6 percent.

Jiang said that although there was surplus of capital fluidity as a whole, financing demand in some industries still exceeded supply.

He suggested that financing innovation in China's banking industry should be accelerated.

The CBRC would approve commercial banks with good pricing and risk controls to manage new credit products, he said.
