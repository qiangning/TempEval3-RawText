Natural and man-made catastrophes caused global economic losses of about 40 billion dollars (30 billion euros) in 2006, but less than a third was covered by insurance, the reinsurance company Swiss Re said on Wednesday

Thirty thousand people worldwide were estimated to have lost their lives in catastrophes over the year, the company said in a statement on preliminary estimates of losses for the year.

Typhoons and earthquakes hit mainly at newly industrialising countries in 2006, where insured values are relatively low, and so the impact on the industry was "quite mild" the company said.

Only 15 billion dollars' worth of the 40 billion dollars in losses were covered by insurance, it added.

"After years of record losses, property insurers appear to be getting off lightly in 2006," Swiss Re said.

"Catastrophe losses of only 15 billion dollars will allow them to replenish their risk capital, depleted by record payments for hurricane damage in 2005 and 2004," it added.

Reinsurers were hit with costs in excess of 75 billion dollars last year, according to Swiss Re's German peer, Munich Re.

Hurricane Katrina, which pummelled the southern United States and caused widespread flooding in New Orleans, accounted for around 45 billion dollars alone, according to estimates released by Munich Re at the end of 2005.

In 2006, three events racked up losses for insurance companies over one billion dollars; two tornados in the United States and one typhoon in Japan, according to Swiss Re.

Over the last 20 years, this makes 2006 the third-lowest year for insurance losses after 1997 and 1988, it added.

The United States had a quiet hurricane season, Europe suffered no expensive catastrophes, and nor was any major industrialised region hit by earthquakes.   Very expensive man-made disasters such as major air crashes or large-scale fires were also conspicuous by their absence, the company noted.
