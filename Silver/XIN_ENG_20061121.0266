The Sudanese government has pulled the plug on the Danish minister of development co-operation 's week-long visit to the Darfur province, said reports reaching here from Copenhagen on Tuesday.

In an apparent tit-for-tat measure after comments made by Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen last week, the Sudanese government has abruptly withdrawn its permission to allow a Danish fact-finding mission to war-torn Darfur province, the Copenhagen Post reported.

The minister of development co-operation, Ulla Toenaes, was scheduled to depart at the end of this week. She said she was blindsided by the last minute announcement.

"I'm surprised about this turnaround so soon before departure," she said. "We haven't received any reason for the cancellation."

Toenaes had expected to meet with government leaders about the escalating humanitarian crisis in Darfur and visit a camp for internally displaced persons. Some 200,000 people have been killed in the Darfur province in recent years.

Some observers suggested that Sudanese officials were angered by Rasmussen's comments last week that military intervention in Darfur might be necessary in order to bring the conflict under control.

Rasmussen told parliament that he felt it was a "disgrace" that the international community had done little to prevent violence in the region.
