Palestinian sources said on Monday that Fatah primaries in central Gaza Strip were postponed following riots occurred at ballot centers.

All ballot centers in Deer Al-Balah district and some of centers in al-Bureig and al-Maghazi districts were shut down due to the riots.

Witnesses said a number of gunmen stormed one of ballot stations in Deer al-Balah and ordered all voters and people inside to go away, and the militants claimed that their names are not listed in voting lists and they can not vote.

One Fatah official said such an act proves that holding primaries in central Gaza Strip districts is meaningless.

The primaries started in main Gaza Strip areas Monday morning. The poll in the southern city of Rafah will be held on Wednesday.
