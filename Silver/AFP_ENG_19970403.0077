India's Congress (I) party said Thursday it would not back down after withdrawing support from the beleaguered ruling coalition but would do its best to avoid fresh elections.

"There is no question of any compromise," Congress spokesman Vithal Gadgil told AFP. "We have withdrawn our support to the government, and there is no question of withdrawing the withdrawal.

"Our stand is there should be a Congress-led coalition."

The 10-month government of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda was reduced to a minority after the Congress withdrew its parliamentary backing on March 30 and then staked its own claim to form a government.

It wants the United Front, which faces a vote of confidence in parliament on April 11, to step aside and back a Congress government.

Gadgil, however, said the faction-ridden Congress was opposed to fresh elections.

"We don't want elections," he said. "We will try our best to see that elections don't take place. That is why we have told the United Front if you want to prove your credentials, back a Congress-led coalition."

Gadgil's comments followed reports that Congress president Sitaram Kesri was under pressure to compromise after failing to split the ruling coalition and woo some of its partners to its side.
