Chinese President Hu Jintao said here Sunday that it is in the common interest of both China and the United State to oppose and contain "Taiwan Independence", and to safeguard stability across the Taiwan Straits.

"The Chinese government and people have been committed to safeguarding peace across the Taiwan Straits, and will make the utmost efforts with the utmost sincerity to achieve the country's peaceful reunification, but we will never tolerate 'Taiwan Independence'," Hu told the press after his talks with visiting US President George W. Bush.
