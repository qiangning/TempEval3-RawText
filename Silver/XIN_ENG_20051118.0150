The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a circular requiring local departments to enhance quarantine and supervision of the poultry trade.

Millions of chickens, ducks, geese and other poultry have been culled after bird flu outbreaks were reported in Xinjiang uygur autonomous region, Liaoning, Hubei, Anhui and Hunan provinces.

The circular requires veterinary and quarantine departments at all levels to improve their quick-response mechanisms and enhance supervision over feeding, slaughtering and stockpiling of poultry.

Unqualified and unlicensed poultry processors are to be closed immediately. The processing, sale, transport and consumption of sick fowl are forbidden, the circular said.

The ministry emphasized the blockade, culling, inoculation and disposal work in epidemic zones, saying the trade of poultry from non-affected zones should not be hampered so as to safeguard normal market order.

The blockade areas should not be expanded without warrant, and special effort should be made to prevent the entry of infected birds from overseas, it said.

The ministry demanded firm action be taken against illegal activities such as falsifying quarantine certificates, arbitrary fee and fine collection by quarantine officials.

The circular asked all relevant departments to enhance information exchange and coordination, so as to ensure the prevention and control of the highly pathogenic bird flu.
