Israel's Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the legality of targeted strikes against suspected Palestinian militants should be determined on a case-by-case, army radio reported.

"We cannot determine in advance that all targetted killings are contrary to international law. At the same time, it is not possible that all such liquidations are in line with international law," the radio quoted the ruling as saying.

The legality of all targeted killings must be examined on a case by case basis," it said.
