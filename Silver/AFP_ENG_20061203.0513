Sochaux and Lille joined Lens in second place on Sunday as the battle for the 'other two' Champions League places hots up in France.

Sochaux beat ailing giants Marseille 1-0 while Lille won 3-1 at Nancy.

With champions Lyon running away with the league again this season, the real race is for second and third place and a spot in next season's money-spinning Champions League competition.

Rabiu Afolabi scored the winner for Sochaux with 13 minutes left to play against the increasingly troubled Marseille, who now have only two wins in their last 10 league matches.

But despite their lofty position, Sochaux coach Alain Perrin, formerly of Portsmouth, is not getting carried away.

"If we start to let things happen, or start thinking we can rely on team-mates and each person can relax a little, all those are things that can pull the rug from under the feet of a successful team," said Perrin.

"Our work is psychological now to keep the pressure on this team to continue to perform."

Nancy took the lead early in the second half at home to Lille through Benjamin Gavanon.

But just past the hour mark Mathieu Bodmer restored parity and minutes later Mathieu Debuchy gave the visitors the lead before Souleymane Youla's injury time clincher.

On Saturday, Lyon broke another French record after a 1-0 win at Le Mans gave them their 14th win from the first 16 matches this season.

That win bettered the mark of 13 wins from the opening 16 contests set by Paris St Germain in the 1985/86 season. And incredibly it was Lyon's coach Gerard Houllier who was in charge of that team as well.

The victory moved Lyon on to 43 points but was due more to industry than flair as former Arsenal forward Sylvain Wiltord headed home a free-kick from Brazil midfielder Juninho just before the hour mark.

Houllier was not interested in his team's record-breaking feat, preferring to concentrate on improving another record they broke last season.

That was when Lyon won a record fifth title in a row and they now look almost certain to add a sixth to that run with their nearest challengers already 14 points off the pace.

"We have taken a giant step towards the title," said a beaming Houllier when interviewed by Canal Plus.

"What pleased me was that we cleared the ball when we had to, when you're under the cosh, you're under the cosh. Today we controlled the game. This was a victory for hard work. Solidarity and control paid off."

Houllier may have been letting himself get carried away by a narrow victory at one of the league's minnows, but Le Mans coach Frederic Hantz had a more sobre assessment of the situation.

"Football is a game played by 11 players and at the end, Lyon win," Hantz said.

Lyon's next league game is away to PSG whose Sunday match against Toulouse had to be postponed for security concerns.

In it's place, around 1,200 fans marched in protest at the killing of a fan by an off-duty police officer the previous month after a UEFA Cup tie.

The fan was among a mob attacking a French-Israeli fan and chanting antisemitist and racist slogans.

Lens won 3-0 at home to last seasons runners-up Bordeaux. Vitorino Hilton opened the scoring on 40 minutes and Daniel Cousin made the points safe on 57 minutes before Issam Jemaa's late cherry on the cake.

Struggling Monaco gave their beleaguered fans something to cheer about with a 3-0 coasting against Valenciennes.

St Etienne are fifth after a 2-0 win over Lorient, in which both sets of fans demonstrated their support for PSG's ultras.
