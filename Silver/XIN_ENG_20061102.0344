Portugal beat Uruguay 5-4 on Thursday in the Group C opener of the second World Cup for beach soccer, which runs until Nov. 12 on Copacabana Beach, in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro.

"The Uruguay team played a typically South American game and knows how to neutralize our moves efficiently. But my men showed their patience and waited for the best moments to launch decisive attacks," Ze Miguel, Portugal's manager told media after the game.

Portugal had to fight hard for the three championship points: opening scoring with an Alan goal in the second minute, only to see their advantage evaporate as Uruguay's Ortiz struck back.

Alan scored again, but Matais and Oli scored one each to put Uruguay ahead. Madjer equalized for Portugal just before the first half whistle, but Uruguay opened the second half with Saranasi Sobral's scorpion kick to goal.

Hernani and Madjer fought back with a goal each to secure a 5-4 victory for the Portuguese.

The next Group C games are Portugal versus Cameroon and Uruguay versus the Solomon Islands, both on Saturday.

Portugal finished second at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, and the last European Cup.
