The route, inaugurated recently, will enable Myanmar export goods to be shipped directly to Indonesia without requiring to transit through intervening ports.

Having a cargo handling capacity of over 8,000 tons, the vessel arrived in Yangon from Chennai Port in India and would proceed to Vietnam after picking up Myanmar goods, a vessel official said, adding that the new route would also facilitate export of Myanmar goods to Malaysia, Singapore, China and India.

There are 24 international shipping lines which stop at four ports of Yangon -- Thilawa, Bo Aung Kyaw, Asia World and Myanmar Industrial Port, of which the Thilawa stands the largest to accommodate the 176-meter-long MV Forkus.

Meanwhile, the two countries' business organizations are also seeking direct trade link between Bandung and Yangon, business circle said.
