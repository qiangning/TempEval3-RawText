The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has warned of increasing violence in northeastern Uganda, noting the violence could have a lasting impact on the civilians, especially children.

The UNICEF said in a statement issued here on Wednesday that the violence in areas of northern Kotido district linked to the ongoing disarmament exercise of armed warriors by the Ugandan military could pose both short and long term effects on the children due to sustained exposure to violence.

"Violence can keep children out of school and rob them of the chance to fulfill their potential. Multiplied many times over, violence robs the community of its potential for development," said Martin Mogwanja, the UNICEF representative in Uganda.

The UN's agency again called for restraint of all arms carriers in the region to avoid further escalation of insecurity and to minimize the impact of innocent civilians, especially on the lives of children and families.

Of late the Ugandan military has been carrying out lethal offensives against armed warriors following several attacks by the warriors on the military and civilians.

The latest reports from UN staff in the area confirm that 13 women and nine children have died in connection with the ongoing disarmament operations in the past month.

Following the increasing mayhem in the region, UNICEF, through CARITAS and the Church of Uganda and in coordination with district authorities, has provided emergency humanitarian support in the form of non-food items and first-aid kits to displaced persons in Kotido District.

The UNICEF also supported OXFAM to provide emergency water and sanitation services to provide relief to approximately 1,500 people.

"There must be a redoubling of efforts to enable all children and women in Uganda to have unhindered access to protection, as well as health, education, safe water, shelter and other essential services," said Mogwanja.

The Ugandan military embarked on the disarmament exercise in the region in 2001, following the continued cattle rustling by the warriors.

Since the exercise was launched the military has so far collected over 10,000 guns out of the estimated amount of 40,000 illegal weapons scattered in northeastern Uganda.
