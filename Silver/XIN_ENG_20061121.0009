Mt. Merapi in Indonesia's Java island calmed down Tuesday morning after spewing hot clouds up to three kilometers down from its peak Monday night.

The local government in Sleman district had called on people living on the volcano's slope to increase their awareness for possible more hot clouds and floods of cold lava.

"Merapi is still in the status of alert, and we are still monitoring its development," Sleman district head Ibnu Subiyanto was quoted by the national Antara news agency as saying.

In April, thousands of people living in the slopes of the mountain, located in the border area between Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, were evacuated as it spewed volcanic materials and hot clouds up to six kilometers away from its peak.

Two were killed in the last eruption.

Indonesia sits astride the "Ring of Fire," a series of volcanoes and fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and Southeast Asia to New Zealand.

It has more active volcanoes than any other nation.

The eruption of Mt. Merapi in 1994, killed 60 people. About 1, 300 people were killed when it erupted in 1930.
