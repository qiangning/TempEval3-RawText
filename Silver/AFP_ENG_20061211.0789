US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on Russia Monday to cooperate fully with investigations into the mysterious radioactive poisoning of a former spy and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"We've been very clear with the Russia government that all of these issues need to be investigated and investigated thoroughly," Rice told AFP in an exclusive interview.

"We think total cooperation on this is necessary," she said.

The former spy, Alexander Litvinenko, died last month in London after being contaminated with the radioactive substance polonium-210.

Investigations have since found traces of the substance in locations around London that were visited by Litvinenko after he met with two Russian contacts.

German police subsequently found traces of the polonium in Hamburg, where one of the contacts, Dmitry Kovtun, stopped on his way from Moscow to London for the meeting.

Hamburg prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against Kovtun for apparently bringing the radioactive substance into the country from Russia and said they considered him "more a perpetrator than a victim."

Litvinenko's widow said at the weekend she was convinced he was killed by a Russian "hit squad" because of his criticism of Putin and Russia's handling of the war in Chechnya.

Russia has strongly denied any role in Litvinenko's murder.

"Everybody ought to try to get to the bottom of it, because it has dimensions which are quite troubling given there are traces of (polonium) showing up in lots of different places," Rice said.

Rice, who first entered government as a policy expert on the Soviet Union in the 1980s, has in the past voiced concern about anti-democratic developments in Putin's Russia, including a string of politically motivated murders and the growing power of the Kremlin and its allies over the media and economy.
