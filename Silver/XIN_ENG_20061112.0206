Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir reiterated on Sunday his country's refusal of deploying an international peacekeeping force to be sent by the United Nations in the western Sudanese region of Darfur.

The Sudanese president reiterated the position during a meeting with French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, who arrived in Khartoum on the same day on a two-day official visit in Sudan.

Sudanese Minister of State for Foreign Affairs al-Wasila al- Samani told reporters following the meeting that al-Bashir urged the world society to help reinforce the 7800-strong African Union troops which are undertaking the peacekeeping mission in Darfur.

The Sudanese president also stressed his country's full respect for the security and sovereignty of Chad and the Central African, denying the accusation that Khartoum was baking rebels of the two countries to launch cross-border attacks from Sudan, al-Samani said.

Al-Samani disclosed that the French foreign minister expressed his "complete understanding" for Sudan's position of refusing the deployment of international peacekeeper in Darfur, and his keenness to mediate between Sudan and Chad and the Central Africa.

"Sudan and France agree that the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) must be completed by bringing in those refusing to accept the agreement until now, and President al-Bashir thanked France for its efforts to help look for a comprehensive settlement for the conflict in Darfur," al-Samani added.

The Sudanese government signed the DPA with a main rebel faction in the Nigerian capital Abuja on May 5. But some other rebel movements have refused to sign the agreement, claiming that it did not meet all their demands.
