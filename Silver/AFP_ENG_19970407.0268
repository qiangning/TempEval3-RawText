Indian border guards shot dead four Moslem guerrillas here Monday following a failed grenade attack on a police officer, officials said.

Two other militants were arrested after the shootout with the Border Security Force (BSF). A BSF spokesman had earlier said three men had been detained.

The initial attack occured in a busy street in a residential area near Islamia College, the spokesman said.

A group of militants threw a grenade and opened fire at the car of deputy superintendent of police Mohammed Shafi Pattro. He escaped unhurt.

Dozens of BSF personnel, who are deployed on Srinagar's streets, rushed to the site and cordoned off several houses from where the militants were firing.

A prolonged gunbattle followed in which four militants died. A BSF officer said: "Our men recovered four AK-47 rifles and a universal machine gun (from the place)."

It was the bloodiest gunbattle in downtown Srinagar since a pro-India Moslem party took office in Kashmir in October, ending almost seven years of federal rule in the Himalayan state.

Moslem militants are fighting for Kashmnir's independence from India. Around 20,000 people have died in the campaign since 1989.
