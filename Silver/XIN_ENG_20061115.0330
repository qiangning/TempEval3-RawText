Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Wednesday that any cabinet meeting was " unconstitutional" after the resignation of all Shiite ministers last week.

"Any (cabinet) session held now is unconstitutional because it would be in breach of Lebanon's national pact," Berri said in an interview with Dubai-based satellite channel Al-Arabiya.

The pro-Syrian speaker was referring to Monday's extraordinary cabinet session which approved a UN draft for the establishment of an international tribunal to try Lebanese former Premier Rafik Hariri's assassination.

Berri noted that the Lebanese constitution guarantees a representation for the country's different religious communities in the government.

On Nov. 11, five Shiite ministers, including two representing Hezbollah, resigned from the 24-member cabinet headed by Prime Minister Foaud Siniora.

Two days later, Lebanese Environment Minister Yaacoub Sarraf, a Christian but an ally of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, also quit from the cabinet.

Their resignations came after the country's top leaders failed to reach agreement on the formation of a national unity government.
