China and the United States should promote bilateral cooperation between their law enforcement organs, a senior Communist Party of China (CPC) official said here Friday.

"The Chinese government hopes the two sides will make substantial progress in their cooperation of arresting and repatriating criminal suspects, anti-terrorism, and drug prohibition in a bid to promote constructive and cooperative relationship in the 21st century," said Luo Gan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, during a meeting with Alberto Gonzales, attorney general of the US department of Justice.

China and the U.S. have enjoyed effective cooperation and coordination with a frequent exchange of high-level contacts, he said. US President George W. Bush will start his visit to China on Nov. 19th.

Bilateral cooperation between the two nations on anti-terrorism, law enforcement, non-proliferation, trade and economics, as well as on the Korean nuclear issue, conforms to the interests of both nations, and is conducive to safeguarding world peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region and world at large, he said.

Calling the law enforcement cooperation as an important component part of Sino-US relations, Luo said the Chinese government will continue to give support to such cooperation.

Gonzales said the U.S. attaches great importance to its relations with China, and that the Department of Justice would like to work with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security to push forward their cooperation in their law enforcement effort.
