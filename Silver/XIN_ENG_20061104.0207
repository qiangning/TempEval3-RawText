Manchester United moved atop of the English Premiership with three points clear on Saturday after they beat Portsmouth 3-0 at the Old Trafford.

Chelsea, however, can pull level on points with them at the top of the table provided that they beat Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday.

Thanks to a brace from inspired Dirk Kuyt, the resurgent Liverpool chalked up their fourth successive win after comfortably overcoming Reading 2-0 at Anfield, while Darren Bent scored his seventh goal of the season to give Charlton a 1-0 home win over Manchester City.

Watford secured their first win of the season as they capitalised on some woeful defensive lapse from Middlesbrough to score a 2-0 home win.

Louis Saha opened the scoring from the penalty spot after only three minutes to set the tone of the thrashing which celebrated Sir Alex Ferguson's 20 years as manager in style.

Cristiano Ronaldo then scored a superb free-kick, while David James denied Gary Neville three times in the match.

Niko Kranjcar missed a great chance for Pompey before Nemanja Vidic headed his first goal at Old Trafford.

Ferguson celebrates two decades at the helm on Monday - and must be extremely satisfied with the calibre and form of his current crop of players.

Wigan scored their third consecutive win on when they beat hosts Bolton 1-0 thanks to Lee McCulloch's goal.

A dour first half saw few chances and little entertainment, but the second period was much more worthy of a derby.

And with 11 minutes left, McCulloch fired home with his right foot from 18 yards after a clever Wigan build-up.

Claus Jensen's deflected second-half strike awarded Fulham a 1-0 victory over visiting Everton.

The sole goal of the Premiership game came in the 65th minute when Jensen's angled shot from 20 yards flew off Tim Cahill and beyond Everton keeper Tim Howard.

It completed the transformation of a game Everton had completely dominated for the first half.

In a later game, Danny Webber scored Sheffield United's first Premiership away goal of the season as the Blades leapfrogged Newcastle and out of the bottom three.

The precious goal arrived in the 68th minute as Webber stooped to head home Nick Montgomery's cross to inflict the Magpies' third home League defeat.
