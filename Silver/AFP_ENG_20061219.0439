The BBC on Tuesday defended their decision to broadcast an interview with a man suspected of murdering five British prostitutes.

Media lawyers said the broadcast could prejudice a jury trial if the man was charged and went to court, but the deputy director of BBC News, Adrian Van Klaveren, said it was "in the public interest" to play the tapes.

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murdering the prostitutes from the eastern English port town of Ipswich in a case which has gripped the nation since the first naked corpse was found in the countryside earlier this month.

The police have not named the suspects but the first one nabbed has been widely reported in national media as supermarket worker Tom Stephens, who spoke to the Sunday Mirror newspaper and the BBC before his arrest Monday.

The BBC recorded the interview for background but once Stephens was arrested, the corporation decided to broadcast the footage.

The BBC considered whether the transmission "could be prejudicing any potential legal action" but decided that this was "not the case", explained Van Klaveren.

"We then had to think about the ethical issues around actually deciding to release a conversation which had been done on a different basis.

"We felt in these very extraordinary and very rare circumstances there was actually a justification for doing that."

Lawyer Christopher Sallon branded the decision to broadcast "absolutely wrong" on the grounds that it was "contrary to the Contempt of Court Act" and "contrary to the spirit" of that legislation.

"It can only encourage speculation and in my view, having seen the interview, prejudice the trial," he told BBC television.

Defence lawyer Julian Young added: "The ultimate public interest must be a fair trial."

The Daily Telegraph newspaper's legal editor Joshua Rozenberg said juries were always told to forget anything they read in the press about the case and most take up to a year to reach the courts.

"But if there has been a huge amount of publicity, cumulative publicity, and something unusual like an interview, or lots of photographs, then it might be quite difficult for the jury to ignore that and the impression it creates," he told BBC radio.
