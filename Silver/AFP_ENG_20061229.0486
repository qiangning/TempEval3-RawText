US-based rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) Saturday condemned the hanging of deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, saying history would judge his trial and execution "harshly".

"Saddam Hussein was responsible for horrific, widespread human rights violations, but those acts, however brutal, cannot justify his execution, a cruel and inhuman punishment," said HRW International Justice Programme director Richard Dicker.

"The test of a government's commitment to human rights is measured by the way it treats its worst offenders. History will judge the deeply flawed Dujail trial and this execution harshly," Dicker said in a statement.
