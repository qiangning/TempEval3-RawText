About 170,000 hospitality tickets from an original contingent of 346,950 are available, the International Sports and Entertainment AG (iSe) announced on Thursday.

The prices of the tickets for the games next year in Germany are between 633 and 15,000 euros.

"We are confident to be sold out at the World Cup," iSe Managing Director George Tayler told a press conference in the southern German city of Munich.

The company expects huge demand for tickets once the World Cup draw has taken place in Leipzig on December 9, Tayler was quoted by the German news agency DPA.

Regular tickets cost between 35 for the cheapest group and 600 euros for the most expensive final game. However, hospitality tickets start at 633.

Those who want to see the final in Berlin must buy a package including games in other cities.

"Our price is below that of France in 1998," Tayler said.

The iSe paid the world soccer body FIFA 180 million euros for the hospitality tickets license and may gain an estimated 700 million euros if all the tickets were sold out.
