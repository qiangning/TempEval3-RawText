Four Iraqis, including a police commando, were killed and seven others wounded in two roadside bomb attacks in Baghdad on Monday, a police source said.

"A roadside bomb struck a police commando patrol at about 8:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) in Saidiyah district in southern Baghdad, killing a commando member and wounding three others," Ahmed Abdullah from Baghdad police told Xinhua.

"Another roadside bomb exploded at about 9:00 a.m. (0600 GMT) in the Camp Sarah area in southeastern Baghdad shortly after an Iraqi army convoy passed by," Abdullah said.

The blast destroyed a civilian car, killing three people and wounding four others, he added.

Insurgents frequently target the fledgling Iraqi security troops, accusing them of collaborating with the US occupation forces.
