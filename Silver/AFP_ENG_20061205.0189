Automobile sales in Germany rose sharply in November, reinforcing expectations for full-year growth, the VDA auto industry federation said on Tuesday.

The number of new car registrations -- a key yardstick of domestic demand in the sector -- jumped by 18 percent to 326,000 vehicles last month, VDA said in a statement.

And that put the industry on target for a three-percent rise in sales to 3.4 million vehicles for the whole of 2006, the VDA said.
