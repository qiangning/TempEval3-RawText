Opposition Labor Party leader Shimon Peres called Sunday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign because of continuing suspicions over his role in the "Bibigate" scandal.

"The prime minister must draw the necessary conclusions and hand in his resignation," Peres told Israel radio.

Peres's statement came after attorney general Eliakim Rubinstein said corruption charges would not be pressed against Netanyahu because of lack of evidence.

The opposition leader demanded early elections and announced a national petition campaign.

Yossi Sarid and several other left-wing opposition MPs announced that they will file an appeal to the supreme court to force the attorney general's office to review its decision to close the file on Netanyahu.

Although the prime minister was not charged, Rubinstein said: "The very fact that these allegations have been sounded creates a cloud of suspicion and an unhealthy atmosphere, but one that does not amount to grounds for filing an indictment."

"There are certain grounds for bewilderment," he said, referring to Netanyahu's actions.

Rubinstein said that Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, who also faced police recommendations that he be charged over alleged influence- peddling in the appointment of an attorney general, would not be indicted.

The prime minister's chief of staff Avigdor Lieberman however, will face further investigation, the attorney general added.
