Iranian Supreme Leader Seyed Ali Khamenei said here on Tuesday that there was no limit for Iran on the development of cooperation with Iraq, the official IRNA news agency reported.

"Iran is proud of Iraq's progress, security, independence and national strength and there is no limit on the development of cooperation with Iraq," Khamenei was quoted as saying at a meeting with visiting Iraqi President Jalal Talabani.

Khamenei said Iran and Iraq enjoyed long-standing religious, cultural and historical affinity, stressing that Iran was pleased with the political process for the establishment of a democratic government in Iraq.

Khamenei called on the Iraqi nation to "leave behind the current ordeal" and foster national solidarity in order to pave the way for setting a timetable for the withdrawal of occupation forces.

"Iraqi people will be exposed to the US pressure if the government and Iraqi people fail to strengthen their unity," Khamenei said.

For his part, Talabani expressed pleasure with his visit to Iran, terming the bilateral relations as strategic, according to IRNA.

Earlier in the day, Talabani also met Chairman of the Expediency Council Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

Leading a ranking delegation, Talabani arrived in the Iranian capital Tehran on Monday afternoon for a three-day official visit. The Iraqi president held close-door official talks with his Iranian counterpart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad soon after arrival.

Iran and Iraq fought a lengthy war from 1980 to 1988, during which altogether more than 500,000 people were killed.

The downfall of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein paved the way to the normalization of relations between the two once hostile neighbors.

Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari paid a landmark official visit to Iran in mid-July, opening a new chapter in bilateral relations.
