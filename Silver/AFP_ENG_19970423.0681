North Korea on Thursday said it wanted to take part in four party- peace talks, but that three-party talks between South and North Korea and the United States should continue until confidence has been built.

"It is our stand to hold 'four-way talks' for peace and security of the Korean peninsula. We, therefore, put forward a way of realising the talks," the North's Vice Minister of foreign affairs, Kim Kye-Gwan told the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

"In order to make the talks more effective and productive, we proposed to have more rounds of negotiations among the DPRK (North Korea), the United States and South Korea before beginning the 'four-way talks'," Kim said.

Arguing his case, he said "The confidence needed for 'four-way talks' has not yet been built between the DPRK and the United States and, still worse, our equal footing at the talks has not been guaranteed."

"We are ready to have further contacts to this end," added Kim who is also the head of the North Korean delegation to last week's failed talks in New York designed to induce Pyongyang to accept the four- party formula.

The four-party talks would involve South and North Korea as direct interlocutors, with the United States and China in a support role.

In New York, a North Korean official said Wednesday that China should join the talks only after Washington recognizes the North.

South Korea's Yonhap News Agency quoted Han Sung-Ryol, head of the North Korean UN mission, as repeating Kim's insistence that such steps were needed to put the North on an "equal footing" before the four- party talks take place.

The North put forth the "three-plus-one" formula during the last round of meetings with South Korean and US officials in New York on Sunday, Han said.

He noted that while the United States and China recognize South Korea, Washington has no diplomatic ties with Pyongyang. On top of it, the United States still maintains a trade embargo on the North, he said.

The four-party talks could open only after Washington establish ties with Pyongyang and recognizes its socialist system, and only after peaceful co-existence takes root and the North is assured that it would not be absorbed by the South, he said.

Han also told Yonhap in a telephone interview that massive food aid to the hungry North must be realized to build up mutual trust before all countries concerned move toward the four-way talks.

Food aid should not be used as a leverage to force the North to accept talks, he said.

The New York meeting broke up aftr North Korea failed to give a widely-anticipated answer to the US-South Korea talks proposal aimed at replacing the 1953 Korean War armistice with a formal peace treaty.

Although no date has been set for a next meeting, Han said the North was willing to resume contact at any level.

Han noted that North Korean and US officials would sit down for talks on the repatriation of remains of US troops killed during the Korean War of 1950-53 and on restricting North Korean missile exports in New York in May.
