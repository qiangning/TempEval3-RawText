Political leaders in Iraq and abroad focused Saturday on a government for the war-torn nation while a high-profile secular candidate charged that an electoral commission had failed in its mission.

The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq cautioned that ballots from Thursday's legislative poll were still being counted and official results would not be available before the end of the year.

Unofficial estimates, however, suggested polarized results similar to those from elections in January, and Adnan al-Dulaimi of the Iraqi National Concord Front, a list strongly supported by Sunni Arabs, said he was ready to join a coalition.

But former planning minister Mehdi al-Hafez told media in Baghdad: "The results that have been announced are incorrect and are meant to influence public opinion."

He spoke after reports of a sweeping victory for the main religious Shiite coalition, the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA), in nine southern provinces.

"There were many violations in several provinces and there is widespread concern among the electorate, who feel state bodies and the electoral commission failed in their task," Hafez said.

Hafez who ran for office alongside former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shiite, pressed for an official investigation to remove all doubts about the poll's credibility.

Dulaimi in contrast appeared to accept the commission's work, and said: "We will work towards finding a strong coalition in the national assembly that can protect the rights of Iraqis."

The current government, an alliance of Kurds and religious Shiites, took months to form and has been accused of sidelining the country's disaffected Sunni Arab minority.

Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari has said that if the UIA lost, which is unlikely, he would work with whoever won "even if they are not qualified."

Jaafari met Saturday with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraq's Shiites, in all likelihood to discuss the political future of the country.

The religious Shiite UIA, according to estimates from commission sources and party officials, appeared to have swept the largely Shiite south, while a Kurdish alliance had a purportedly commanding lead in the north.

An international mission said Friday that the Iraqi election has generally met international standards, and hailed the organisers for meeting a "difficult challenge."

Iraqi Shiites and Sunni Arabs staged rallies throughout Iraq on Saturday to champion their legislative candidates as the country emerged from a three-day security lockdown.

Facing anemic poll numbers at home over his Iraq policy, US President George W. Bush has trumpeted the election as a victory for the Iraqi people and US policy in Iraq and is hoping a strong government will quickly coalesce.

The new 275-member parliament is to appoint a president and two vice presidents. The presidential council will then have 15 days to name a prime minister, who has 30 days to form a cabinet with parliamentary approval.

A spokesman for Bush said he has contacted the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates and asked them to help Iraq establish a new government.

US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, and General George Casey, the commander of coalition forces in Iraq, said in a statement: "The newly elected leaders should come together quickly and build bridges for national unity."

The UN Security Council also called for "the rapid formation of a representative government" and stressed "the importance of inclusiveness, dialogue and national unity as Iraq's political development moves forward."

While few deaths occurred during the vote, ongoing instability in Iraq was underlined by a mortar attack Friday that killed four children playing football and an Iraqi soldier near the western town of Haditha.

Dulaimi told reporters Saturday that insurgents had agreed not to attack polling stations and thanked them for holding to their promise.

In an interview Friday, Bush admitted that the elections would not solve the problem of the insurgency in Iraq, and that violence would likely continue.

Meanwhile, the Iraqi Central Investigating Court issued an arrest warrant for Mullah Halgurd al-Khabir, accused of masterminding the August 23 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed 22 people, among other attacks.
