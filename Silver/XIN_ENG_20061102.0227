A vehicle of a Japanese nongovernmental organization was fired by shots in northern Afghanistan on Wednesday, Kyodo News reported Thursday.

According to the Japanese Embassy, the vehicle, belonging to Peace Winds Japan, was shot by three bullets from at least four men riding on two motorbikes when it was driving in Sar-i-Pul Province, but two local staffs in the vehicle were fortunately unhurt.

Embassy officials said Taliban remnants or al-Qaida fighters were behind the incident and called for caution.
