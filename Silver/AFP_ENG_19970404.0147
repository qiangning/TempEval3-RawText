South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-Ha will visit Japan for talks with Japanese leaders, a foreign ministry official said Friday.

"Japan is arranging his visit, but the schedule is yet to be fixed," the ministry spokeswoman said.

Japan's Foreign Minister Yukuhiko Ikeda offered the invitation in February when the two met in Singapore, she said. Ikeda visited South Korea in January.

Jiji Press said the South Korean minister would visit Japan for three days from April 14 to meet with Ikeda and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.

Yoo will exchange views with Japanese politicians on food aid to North Korea, a new fishery pact between Tokyo and Seoul and other topics, the news agency quoted a foreign ministry source as saying.

Kyodo News, meanwhile, quoted a South Korean foreign ministry source as saying the two countries had "almost reached an agreement for April 17-19."

Kyodo said topics would include a Japanese fund's compensation payment to Asian women who had been forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II.
