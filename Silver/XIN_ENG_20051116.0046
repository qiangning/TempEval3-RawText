The Chinese mainland said Wednesday it has kept up and will go on with its information exchange and communication with Taiwan on bird flu pandemic.

"So far this year, the mainland-based Cross-Strait Agricultural Exchange Association has briefed relevant groups in Taiwan on the situation of bird flu epidemic 15 times," said Li Weiyi, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, at a routine press conference.

Meanwhile, the relevant parties of the mainland side have worked in coordination with the Secretariat of the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite two experts from Taiwan to an international conference on bird flu held by the WHO in Geneva on Oct. 7, said Li.

The relevant parties in the Chinese mainland and Taiwan will continue with such exchanges and cooperation, Li said.
