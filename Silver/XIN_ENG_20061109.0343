The European Commission on Thursday condemned the attack on a camp for displaced persons in Sri Lanka.

"We are deeply shocked by the attack yesterday (Wednesday) on displaced civilians taking refuge in a school in eastern Sri Lanka. We strongly condemn attacks which lead to loss of innocent civilian life," said European Union (EU) external relations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner and humanitarian aid commissioner Louis Michel in a joint statement.

"This is totally unacceptable and cannot be justified under any circumstances. We are deeply concerned by latest events and call on the government of Sri Lanka to take immediate and appropriate precautions to protect civilian life and guarantee the security of SLMM (Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission)."

The European Commission calls on the government and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) to end violations of fundamental principles of humanitarian law and human rights and guarantee conditions in which humanitarian assistance can be delivered, they said.

They also urged Sri Lankan government and the LTTE to cease hostilities immediately and return to negotiations for a settlement.

"There is no military solution to the conflict," they said.
