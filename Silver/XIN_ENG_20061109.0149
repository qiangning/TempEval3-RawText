Thousands of Kenyans are fleeing their homes in a fourth day of slum gang violence that has left at least eight people dead, witnesses and police said on Thursday.

The fighting between the proscribed Mungiki sect and the local vigilante group "Taliban" began Sunday as they competed for control of the illegal liquor market.

Police spokesman Gideon Kibunja said the death toll rose to eight late Wednesday when a gang member was beaten to death. However, Kibunja said riot police had taken control of most of the slum and were urging people to return home.

Kibunja said four people were hacked to death in skirmishes in Mathare slum between the outlawed Mungiki and Taliban groups while police then shot two people as they attempted to contain the battles that erupted over protection money the gangs levied on brewers of an illegal drink.

"We have arrested some members of the sect and this would continue until calm would be restored," Kibunja said by telephone.

Hundreds of people were expected to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed in parts of the slum where fighting between the two rival gangs and Kenyan police had taken place.

"At the moment the situation is under control. The police have normalized the situation and calm seemed to have returned last night," Kibunja said.

Moses Odhiambo, a slum dweller, said he was forced to relocate his family after his house was torched, saying he was afraid to return home due to insecurity.

"I cannot return home if what I saw last night is anything to go about. The gang struck at night because they fear daylight due to police patrol, but in the night the police are nowhere to be seen giving the gangs advantage to roam around," Odhiambo said.

Police has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the slum but many residents camped outside Nairobi's military air base overnight and many people continue to leave the area.
