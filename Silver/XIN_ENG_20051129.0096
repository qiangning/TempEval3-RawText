A countrywide dawn-to-dusk hartal for Thursday was called in Bangladesh to protest against Tuesday's court bombings simultaneously in southeastern Chittagong and northeastern Gazipur by Islamic militant outfit, killing at least seven and injuring scores.

According to private news agency UNB, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), led by its President Mahbubey Alam, announced the hartal after holding an emergency general meeting at the Supreme Court Tuesday noon.

They sought support of all classes of people, including political parties and civil society, to Thursday's hartal.

A suicide bomber of Islamist outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) led the bomb attack near a police check-post at Chittagong court building at about 9:05 a.m. (3:05 GMT) Tuesday, killing the bomber and two policemen, and injuring 16 others.

In another explosion thereafter at about 9:45 a.m. (GMT 3:45) at bar library on the Gazipur district court premises, four people were killed on the spot and 50 injured.

One of the four dead might be the suicide bomber, whose body was wrapped up with wire of bombs.

Agitated lawyers of different district bars boycotted courts in an instant protest against the bomb attacks in Chittagong and Gazipur.

Lawyers in Dhaka, Chittagong, Gazipur, Sylhet and other districts staged wildcat strike through boycott of courts and brought out protest march in the court compounds.

On Nov. 14, a JMB suicide squad bombed a court microbus in southern Jhalakati district, killing two senior assistant judges.

Earlier, the activists of the banned JMB staged serial bombings simultaneously at court and government establishments in 63 district headquarters on Aug. 17, leaving two people dead and hundreds wounded.

On Oct. 3, court bombings carried out by the militants in three districts left two people dead.

For last few days, the JMB, calling for establishment of Islamic rule replacing the man-made law, has been issuing warnings to judges and officials along with death threats if they failed to execute Islamic law in Bangladesh.
