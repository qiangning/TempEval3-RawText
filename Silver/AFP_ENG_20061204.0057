The Israeli army has been ordered to avoid "unneccessary friction" with the Palestinians while operating in the occupied West Bank, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Monday.

"Instructions have been issued to avoid unnecessary frictions and to abstain from actions that could serve as a pretext" for Palestinian militants to break a tentative week-old truce between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Sneh told army radio.

Sneh said "the army has not always paid enough attention to avoid such frictions" in the past.

The statement came after 15 Palestinians were arrested overnight in the West Bank by the army on suspicion of belonging to armed groups.

Five people, including a 15-year-old boy throwing stones at Israeli tanks, have been killed in the West Bank since a fragile truce took effect between armed groups and Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip on November 26.

Sneh said the overnight arrests were aimed at preventing attacks and said the army would continue to operate in the West Bank "to prevent suicide attacks."

Palestinians want the truce to be extended to the occupied West Bank and on Sunday, the al-Aqsa Brigades, a group loosely affiliated with president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, gave Israel two weeks to enact such a measure or risk renewed rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip.

Under the terms of the truce, Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza and militants were supposed to stop firing rockets into the Jewish state from the coastal strip.

Although a handful of such rockets have been fired since in violation, without causing damage or casualties, the truce has held.

On Sunday Israel's security cabinet decided to continue a policy of restraint in the face of the violations, although Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned that the policy could be scrapped if rocket fire continued.
