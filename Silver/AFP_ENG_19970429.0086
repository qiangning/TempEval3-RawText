India's new ruling coalition was left reeling Tuesday by plans to prosecute the leader of its largest government partner for corruption amid doubts over its future stability, alliance leaders said.

Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's nine-day-old fledgling government has been rocked by the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) plans to prosecute Bihar state Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav.

"This has come as a bolt from the blue to us," Jaipal Reddy, spokesman of the 13-party United Front administration, told AFP.

Reddy said the Front, which assumed office April 21 after the coalition replaced former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda with Gujral, was assessing the fallout of the CBI's decision.

"We are still trying to come to grips with things," he said as leftist partners of the centre-left coalition and the media mounted pressure on Yadav to quit his political posts and face prosecution.

Another senior Front leader asking to remain anonymous said the possible prosecution of Yadav, who also heads the centrist Janata Dal (People's Party), could effect the new government's stability.

"Yadav is an important man in the Front and this will have an impact on the government's image and stability," he said, but ruled out a split in the Janata Dal, which accounts for 46 of the Front's 180 members of parliament.

The Congress (I) party, which has given its parliamentary support to keep the coalition in office, however, said the crisis could herald the disintegration of the United Front.

"There never was any unity in the Front and now it will fall apart," Congress leader Rajesh Pilot told AFP.

Yadav, a wily politician, Monday refused to step down after the CBI on Sunday implicated him and 55 other politicians and bureaucrats in the 271-million-dollar financial corruption scandal.

Reports Tuesday said the Indian home ministry will rush federal troops to the crime-prone eastern state because of fears of a backlash.

Yadav has also warned he would "govern Bihar from prison" if he is arrested.

India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party or BJP) and other political rivals of Yadav have called a general shutdown in Bihar on May 3 to demand his ouster.

National dailies Tuesday said Yadav must step down and warned Gujral to face his first crisis as premier with wisdom.

"Yadav must resign," The Pioneer said.

"To cling on limpet-like to the seat of power smacks of autocratic disregard for established norms," it said.

But The Pioneer warned: "The other half of the story in the decline of Yadav is the impact it will have on the United Front.

"The knives in the United Front will soon be out, and the crisis may well prove impossible to contain," it said.

The Times of India said Yadav's prosecution would lead to political in-fighting.

Several of the 55 charged by the CBI are already in jail in connection with the scandal, which surfaced January 27, 1996.

The CBI has claimed that a coterie of politicians, bureaucrats and firms in Bihar had been siphoning huge sums since 1977 from a state government fund set aside to buy cattle feed.
