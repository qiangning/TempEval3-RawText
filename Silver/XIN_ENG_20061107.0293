The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer said here Tuesday that he felt regretful about America's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while praising China for its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission.

"I think it's a great pity that America decided not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol," said de Boer, who is currently attending the UNFCCC in Nairobi, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.

The United States, the world's largest emitter of green house gases, said Monday that there would be no change in its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming until at least the end of American President George W. Bush's second term, due to be in January, 2009.

Bush has incurred the wrath of environmentalists and ecological experts by abandoning the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce the emission of climate change-causing greenhouse gases, saying it would hurt the U.S. economy.

"I do not have any expectations that the U.S. will return or ratify the Kyoto Protocol," said de Boer, who was appointed to the current post by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Aug. 10, 2006. He said America's greenhouse gas emissions are so high that it would be virtually impossible for it to meet the targets under the Kyoto Protocol.

De Boer at the same time applauded China for its environment policy, saying that China is already doing quite a lot in addressing the question of climate change.

"China has very ambitious strategy and also has plans to reduce emission from electricity sector," he said.

The UN conference on climate change kicked off on Monday, with participating parties exploring an international framework to deal with the issue of global warming after 2012, the last year covered by the current gas emission rules under the Kyoto Protocol.

"The discussion on that has just begun," said de Boer, "there was a decision at the meeting in Montreal last year to start two dialogues in the future. One is an ad hoc working group which talks about future industrial country targets, and the other is a broad dialogue on the future."

"All the countries have been saying that we urgently need to develop environment policy beyond 2012. In fact today there were presentations from the EU, from Japan, from Norway, all indicating that they are ready to take on far more stringent emission reductions," he said.

The 1997 Kyoto Protocol requires 35 industrialized countries to reduce their emissions by at least 5.2 percent from 1990 levels by 2012.

A UN report last week indicated that many countries were struggling to meet their targets.
