Leaders of Iraq's bitterly divided political parties unveiled a series of reform ideas Sunday after two days of peace talks aimed at ending the bloodshed engulfing the country.

But a conference spokesman told AFP that delegates had managed to make only one practical suggestion amid various declarations of good intent, an apparent sign that the much-hyped event had ended in disappointment.

"The only important practical measure recommended by the conference is paying sizeable pensions to former soldiers," Naseer al-Ani told AFP.

On Saturday, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki invited some Saddam Hussein-era servicemen to join his armed forces and offered pensions to the others in an olive branch to a community that has filled the ranks of the insurgency.

"Other than that, participants reiterated slogans about national unity and expressed good intentions for reforms that will have to be approved (by government and parliament)," said Ani.

The four committees that compiled the string of recommendations, after two days of talks that Maliki had hoped would isolate insurgents, will now work on implementing their suggestions with government and parliament.

One recommendation would see Iraq reinstate compulsory military service, another suggests independent deputy ministers to be appointed alongside political appointees, and a third wants the Iraqi constitution reviewed.

Yet participants still reaffirmed the principle of articles in the constitution that bans the Baath Party as a political entity.

Tens of thousands of Baathists and Saddam-era military officers were purged from the public service in the aftermath of the March 2003 US-led invasion, with many going on to swell the ranks of groups fighting the new Shiite-led government.

There is now a growing consensus that more junior party members not proven to have supported Saddam-era atrocities or the post-invasion rebellion should be allowed into the political process as a gesture of reconciliation.

The conference marked the first attempt by the coalition government to draw former members of Saddam's army and Baath party into the political process.

But while a small number of former Baathists attended, delegates were disappointed that few representatives of insurgent groups turned up.

Iraq is in the grip of a dirty war between rival Sunni and Shiite factions battling for turf and political power in the chaos that has descended on the country as the government and US military battle Sunni insurgents.
