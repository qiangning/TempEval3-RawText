Kyrgyzstan's Prime Minister Felix Kulov and the entire government of the Central Asian republic tendered their resignation Tuesday in line with a new constitution that requires formation of a fresh cabinet.

"Today, I tendered my resignation to the president," Kulov said in a national radio interview. "In that way we want to set the conditions for the full-blooded work of the new constitution."

The constitution was signed November 9, significantly reducing the powers of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Under the new basic law, parliament, not the president will appoint the next premier and government.

Kyrgyzstan, an impoverished but strategically located republic that hosts both Russian and US air bases, has been struggling to stabilise since longtime president Askar Akayev was overthrown in a street revolt in March 2005.

The country has been plagued by political unrest, contract killings and organised crime.

In November, opposition demonstrators spent a week camped out in the main square of Bishkek demanding constitutional reform.

After an outbreak of violence, Bakiyev finally gave in, signing the new constitution in what he said was "one more step towards democracy."

The new constitution limits the president's powers to dissolve parliament and also gives the legislature the right to appoint the government.

Kulov has been prime minister since the revolution, but his reappointment is not guaranteed in the deeply divided parliament.

In May 2006, Kulov's government tendered its resignation, but this was not accepted by Bakiyev.
