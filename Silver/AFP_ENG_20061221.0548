The dollar held steady against the euro and other currencies on foreign exchange markets Thursday despite a slight downward revision to third quarter US economic growth.

At 22:00 GMT, the euro was changing hands at 1.3173 dollars, showing scarcely any change from 1.3175 dollars late Wednesday.

The US currency lost some ground to the Japanese yen, however, as it declined to 118.32 yen compared with 118.45 yen on Wednesday.

Although the government revised down third quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) to a 2.0 percent growth rate from a prior estimate of 2.2 percent, traders said the markets are looking forward to the economic prospects for 2007.

And while the world's largest economy has slowed considerably this year, they said the market is hopeful that the US economy will glide to a so-called soft-landing in the months ahead rather than pitching into a deeper slowdown.

"US GDP data played little role as headline growth rates slowed slightly but price measures edged up," said Jamie Coleman at IFR Markets.

At the same time, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE, remained unrevised at the high rate of 2.2 percent.

An index of future US economic activity released Thursday suggested the expansion will continue, but at a sluggish pace, giving some support to the dollar, traders said.

The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in November, the same increase as in October. The report was in line with Wall Street forecasts.

The leading index now stands at 138.2 from a 1996 base of 100.

"The slower economy of the second half of 2006 might continue into the first half of 2007. But it may not get any slower," said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.

Traders appeared to largely brush off an unexpected decline in the Philadelphia Fed Index, an industrial activity gauge, which dropped 4.3 percent in December against a gain of 5.1 percent in the prior month.

Some of the report's components were stronger than the headline reading suggested, however, as the index's new orders, shipments and employment readings improved.

The Swiss franc was quoted at 1.2165 dollars, compared with 1.2177 dollars late Wednesday.

The British pound meanwhile was priced at 1.9612 dollars, against 1.9647 a day earlier.
