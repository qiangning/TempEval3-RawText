The visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher on Tuesday said the United States did not have any involvement in the attack on a religious school in Pakistan's tribal region.

"The Pakistani government has said they carried out initiative to deal with serious threats from fighters who were in that location," Boucher told reporters at U.S. embassy.

"The Pakistani government says it has carried out this action. And it was necessary because militants, terrorists created a training center," he said.

He supported Pakistan's policy to engage tribal elders to establish peace in the tribal region.

"Certainly our hope is that these areas can be more peaceful through combination of political steps, economic steps, political influence of people in the areas, the tribal leaders and others," Boucher said.

"But we also recognize there are militants and fighters in these areas. They need to be dealt with by other means," he said.

Boucher ruled out any change in American policy after the mid- term polls.

"We want a long-term partnership with Pakistan," he said.

Boucher met President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz on Tuesday and discussed with them bilateral and regional matters.

He also met Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri, Foreign Secretary and other senior officials from the foreign ministry as well as people from business community.

He said the United States is working together with the government of Pakistan for economic opportunities for the people who are living in the border areas.

Asked if Pakistan is doing enough in the war on terror as media in the United States is critical to Pakistan's role, he said it does not reflects facts.

"Pakistan is a key ally in war on terror. The extremism, the violence, we are fighting against is the same violence threatening the people and the government of Pakistan as well as people in the neighborhood," he said.

"So we have common interests along with others in this region. If any body says it is enough, to me the question does not make any sense. None of us has done enough. We have to keep battle," Boucher said.

"This is strategic struggle for the future of this region. The future of this nation," he said.
