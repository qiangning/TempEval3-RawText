Lebanese political and religionary leaders Tuesday voiced condemnation on the assassination of anti- Syrian Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel earlier in the day.

Gemayel was killed by a gunshot on the head when his convoy was attacked on a street in Jedeide, about 15 km northeast from Beirut.

Following the killing of 34-year-old Gemayel, who was also a Christian leader in Lebanon and son of former president Amin Gemayel, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Seniora said at a press conference that the murder of the anti-Syrian minister "will not terrorize us" and "we will not let the criminal killers control our fate."

The prime minister called for unity in the deeply divided country and pledged that his government will take up all its responsibilities to protect the interests of the people.

He said that the country was more determined to set up the international tribunal for assassinations in the wake of the killing of Gemayel.

The Gemayel assassination "increases our determination to see the creation of the international tribunal" to try suspects in the 2005 murder of former premier Rafiq Hariri, said Seniora.

Meanwhile, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud called on the Lebanese people to unite and start dialogue to overcome political stalemate.

Lahoud described the killing of Gemayel as "a conspiracy that started with the assassination of former premier Rafiq Hariri."

Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, also a prominent anti- Syrian political figure, was killed in a suicide bombing in February 2005, which led to rising anti-Syrian waves and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

Nabih Berri, the parliament speaker, said the murder of Gemayel was an action against the Lebanese state and government by undermining stability and security of the country.

Berri also expressed deep condolence to family of the deceased, vowing to do all he could to hunt down those behind the killing of Gemayel and other officials in Lebanon.

In addition, Lebanese Sunni Mufti Sheikh Mohammad Rasheed Qabbani also denounced the assassination of Gemayel.

"The assassination of Pierre Gemayel amid circumstances of tension and defiance currently being observed in the country was a severe blow to all those who wished that the situations could not reach to this extent," he said.

Describing Gemayel as one of Lebanon's national figures, Free Patriotic Movement leader Michel Aoun, a Christian opposition leader, also denounced the assassination crime.

Gemayel was the fifth anti-Syrian figure to be killed in the past two years.

Lebanon has witnessed a series of blasts since February 2005 when former premier Rafik Hariri was killed in a deadly bombing attack. The most recent assassination was the killing of journalist Gebran Tueni on Dec. 12, 2005.
