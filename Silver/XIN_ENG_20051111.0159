China and the European Union (EU) signed a Memorandum of Understand (MOU) on Friday to set up a consultation and cooperation mechanism on product safety.

Both sides have agreed to exchange information and establish a series of joint initiatives to help safeguard consumers' health and safety.

"The MOU is a voluntary agreement between legislators on food and non-food product safety, which aims to promote common interests and enhance the safety of products traded between the regions," said a press release of the European Commission.

The agreement will also help in reaching solutions to any trade problems and in forging a common view on safety standards, it added.

China is the EU's second largest trading partner, accounting for 8.8 percent of the EU's total trade in 2004. Food products and consumer goods such as electrical appliances, toys, household items and clothing, make up a large proportion of the EU's imports from China.

In the area of non-food consumer goods, the agreement focuses on developing and improving communication channels between the EU and China authorities in order to raise the overall level of product safety.

In 2004, the EU imported over 2 billion euros (about 2.4 billion US dollars) worth of Chinese agricultural goods and food, while exporting over 1 billion euros (about 1.2 billion dollars) worth of such products to China.
