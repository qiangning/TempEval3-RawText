The public needs to be warned about extreme weather and dangerous conditions and be advised of how to reduce damage caused by disasters, according to the health ministry.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) and China Meteorological Administration (CMA) plan to jointly make special broadcast reports providing information about extreme heat, carbon monoxide levels and epidemics, according to an agreement signed recently by the two agencies.

The expert advisory information will focus on helping people cope and protect themselves during bad weather and public health emergencies, according to the MOH.

The MOH and the CMA will jointly conduct research on how the weather influences people's health and will set up a mechanism for monitoring, forecasting and emergency warning.
