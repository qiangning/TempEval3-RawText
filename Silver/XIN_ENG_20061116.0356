The 6th High Level Group Meeting on Education for All (EFA) finished here Thursday with participants urging for "higher spending and more targeted efforts" to meet the "large and urgent" EFA challenges by 2015.

The meeting, co-hosted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Egyptian education ministry, opened Tuesday night, "takes place towards the end of another significant year for development and for education, " said a final communique.

"Education is higher on the political agenda, and many countries have made efforts to raise educational budgets," it said.

The newly-published 2007 EFA Global Monitoring Report indicated that further progress has been made in the EFA, with over 37 million more children in primary school from 1999 to 2004, said the communique.

Besides, more countries have abolished school fees, and aid to education is on the rise. Two-thirds of the 181 countries with data have now achieved gender parity at primary level.

But, the remaining EFA challenge is large and urgent. For instance, of 781 million adult illiterates, only 100 million will achieve literacy by 2015 at current rates of progress, said the communique.

The communique recommends that countries spend 4-6 percent of national income on education, and that donors raise levels of predictable and long-term financing to reach the 11 billion U.S. dollars required annually for universal primary education, adult literacy and early childhood care and education (ECCE).

Participants worldwide committed themselves to a stronger focus on ECCE and advised that governments and aid agencies increase funding to ECCE substantially above current levels.

As education is key to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, participants called for stronger integration of education sector planning with broader development objectives at both national and international level, said the communique.

The communique said attendees to the meeting stressed the central role of education in responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and urged stronger links be developed between education sector planning and the commitment to universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment and support by 2010.

The communique also called for "innovation and new investment" in adult literary, characterizing the current situation in which one adult in five lacks literacy skills as "unacceptable."

Some 35 education ministers worldwide, UNESCO Director General Koichiro Matsuura and leaders of aid agencies and civil society organizations attended the three-day meeting.

Senegal will host the next High Level Group Meeting on EFA on Dec. 11-13 of 2007.
