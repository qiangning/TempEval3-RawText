British Prime Minister Tony Blair called on the United States and the European Union Monday night to take "bold" and "ambitious" steps to make the international trade negotiations next month a success.

In his speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at the Guildhall in central London in honor of the past mayor, Blair said the EU and US should "break the logjam" which threatens the talks in Hong Kong by making concessions on agricultural subsidies and tariffs.

In return, he said, developing countries must open up to foreign investment.

Terrorism also tops his speech. In Blair's view, reducing world poverty would help fight terrorism.

"In a modern world there is no security or prosperity at home unless we deal with the global challenges of conflict, terrorism, climate change and poverty. Self interest and mutual interest are inextricably linked. National interests can best be advanced through collective action," he said.

He urged the world to calculate not just "the human misery of the poor themselves", but the loss of developed countries, "the aid, the lost opportunity to trade, the short-term consequences of the multiple conflicts; the long-term consequences on the attitude to the wealthy world of injustice and abject deprivation amongst the poor."

The World Trade Organization meeting is scheduled on December 13 in Hong Kong, with growing fears that the pledge on poverty by Group of Eight leaders at Gleneagles in July may not result in a meaningful deal.

Despite offers from major players like the US and the EU to consider reductions in agricultural subsidies and tariffs in order to open up markets to poorer nations, negotiators have so far held back from the kind of breakthrough sought by anti-poverty campaigners.

"We need a comprehensive, ambitious agreement to cut barriers to trade in the three key areas: agriculture, non-agricultural market access, and services," Blair said.

The British leader suggested that specific measures to help the poorest countries should include doubling investment in infrastructure and eliminating all export subsidies, while rules applied to exports from the poorest developing countries be simplified.

The Hong Kong meeting comes at the end of Blair's year-long presidency of the G8 as well as the six-month presidency of the EU. And Blair is trying hard for a trade deal at the meeting.
