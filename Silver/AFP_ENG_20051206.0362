The HIV/AIDS virus is destroying family life across Africa, international health experts warned Tuesday as they met in the Nigerian capital Abuja.

"The family has been made fragile in Africa because of poverty and because of AIDS," Rima Salah, deputy executive director of the UN children's agency UNICEF, told reporters.

"Our interventions focus on treating individuals and ignore the cornerstone of African society, the family," she added.

Delegates to the 14th International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections in Africa (ICASA) said that while the family should be a strong unit in the fight against AIDS, it was being undermined.

In poor families where the two parents had difficulty in making ends meet, the death of even one parent from AIDS places an intolerable economic strain on the household.

If both parents die, the children are left to fend for themselves and take charge of younger brothers and sisters.

Girls with little education who find themselves catapulted into the role of head of household may have no option other than turning to prostitution to support their brothers and sisters, putting themselves at risk of being infected if they are not already.

"Children being affected is a major social crisis ... in terms of taking care of them and in terms of family stability", Michel Sidibe, deputy director of UNAIDS, the body that groups together ten UN agencies in the fight against AIDS.

Husbands infect their wives and mothers infect their children.

Even though the technology to prevent mother-to-child transmission exists, the necessary measures can only be implemented if pregnant women attend ante-natal consultations. Such consultations are unheard of in large swathes of rural sub-Saharan Africa.

Cliff, a 23-year-old Nigerian living with AIDS told delegates how, as a teenager, he had been told he could only catch the disease through "serial relationships with prostitutes".

He became infected. He was kicked out of the navy after his HIV-positive status became known and, ashamed to stay in his home village, ran away to Abuja.

Now his wife and two-year old son are also infected.

Even though half of mother-to-child transmissions occur during delivery, his wife was told that as long as she avoided breast-feeding any child she bore would be free of the virus.

"When my son was one year old he was declared HIV-positive", Cliff said, adding: "I often feel tears coming to my eyes when I see him".

Sub-Saharan Africa, the region the worst affected by the pandemic, was home to an estimated two million HIV-positive children in late 2005.

Some poverty-stricken parents may hesitate to take antiretrovirals, even now that their prices have been slashed across the continent, because the money they do have to spend on the drugs means less food is available to feed the family.

For Jim Kim, the World Health Organization's outgoing head of HIV/AIDS, the fact that mothers now have access to antiretrovirals, which can, if the patient has access to adequate food, prolong life by up to 15 years, is already a positive step.

"If we can prevent mother-to-child transmission and treat children then we're going to be able to allow (infected) mothers to raise their children to the age of 15", he told AFP.
