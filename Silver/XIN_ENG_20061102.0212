NAIROBI, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- World Bank says Africa has shown tangible progress in the effort to uplift millions of people out of poverty line.

The World Bank's annual study of the continent found that 16 African states had managed to maintain annual economic growth of more than 4.5 percent since the 1990s.

The report released in Nairobi Thursday said many African countries, including Senegal, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Uganda, Ghana and Cape Verde, have lifted significant percentages of their citizens above the poverty line and might well be on course to meeting the income poverty Millennium Development Goal ( MDG) target of halving poverty by 2010.

The annual World Bank publication, African Development Indicators (ADI) 2006, depicts diverse continent, with several countries making remarkable progress, some stagnating and others lagging seriously behind.

"Africa today is a continent on the move, making tangible progress on delivering better health, education, growth, trade and poverty-reduction outcomes," said Gobind Nankani, the bank's vice- president for the Africa region.

The bank's report highlighted the extreme diversity of economic achievement in Africa.

The report says the full spectrum of achievers and laggards stretches from Zimbabwe, which recorded a negative growth rate of 2. 4 percent -- the only country with a negative growth rate in 2004 on the continent.

"While economic outcomes are increasingly diverse, Africa has made near uniform progress in social outcomes, notably education and health," explained John Page, the bank's chief economist for the Africa region, adding that Africa's per capita income is now increasing in tandem with other developing countries.

The report also noted that inflation on the continent was down to historic lows, and that the region had managed to weather the impact of higher oil prices in recent years.

On a more negative note, the bank said foreign investment in the continent was just 10.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2004 -- only 1.6 percent of global foreign investment -- and that more than 50 percent of the funds were spent in Nigeria and Sudan.

The report also highlighted the difficulty of starting a business in many parts of Africa -- taking, across the continent, an average of 64 days.

In its latest Africa report, the World Bank said that many countries had made good progress in meeting some of the other MDGs, such as getting more young children into primary education and improving child mortality.

Looking forward, it said improved governance and management of natural resources was a key requirement, particularly with African nations due to receive a 200 billion dollars windfall from oil revenues between 2000 and 2010.

It said it was seeing signs that African leaders were taking more responsibility for improving governance and assisting the private sector in attracting foreign investment and boosting trade with growing markets like those in China and India.

"The good news includes confirmation that primary enrollment rates have risen significantly across the continent. HIV/AIDS prevalence and child mortality rates have started to fall and the gender gap has started to shrink in several countries."

"Gross primary enrollment rates as a share of the relevant age group -- a standard indicator of investment in the poor -- shot up to 93 percent in 2004 from 72 percent in 1990, contributing to a rise in literacy rates from 50 percent in 1997 to 65 percent in 2002," explained Page.

He regretted that success increasing primary enrollments from 70 percent in 1991 to above 90 percent in 2004 has not been mirrored in secondary and tertiary education.

Despite the tangible progress, ADI 2006 highlights the numerous challenges facing Africa, the lone region of the world where the number of the poor continues to rise.

The ADI 2006 calls for the lifting of burdensome rules of origin through reforms in the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act and the EU's Everything But Arms initiative, but also for reforms " behind the border" (within African countries) to promote intra- African trade.

The report also warns that the immense disease burden posed by HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, as well as by corruption, anemic aid, cascading tariffs barring made-in-Africa products from entering global markets and dwindling foreign direct investments pose a threat to gains in overall poverty alleviation.

"Improving governance and smart management of natural resource rents are key requirements for improving development outcomes in Africa, where an estimated windfall of more than 200 billion dollars in oil revenue alone will accrue to African governments between 2000 and 2010," said Nankani, reflecting on the fact natural resource-rich economies have tended to make slow progress on the continent despite their enormous wealth endowment.
