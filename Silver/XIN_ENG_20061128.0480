A new type of stethoscope was set to enable doctors to hear the sounds of the body in extremely loud situations, such as during the transportation of wounded soldiers in Blackhawk helicopters, American Institute of Physics reported on Tuesday.

Using ultrasound technology, the new stethoscope design will be presented later this week at the Fourth Joint Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America and the Acoustical Society of Japan, which will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Researchers at Active Signal Technologies, Inc., in collaboration with the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory, have developed the ultrasound stethoscope that is almost impervious to loud noise and is capable of making accurate readings during noise levels of up to 120 decibels, similar to the volume experienced at the front row of a rock concert.

Current acoustic stethoscope technology picks up and amplifies vibrations that let doctors hear the heart and lungs. These models become difficult to use effectively at around 80 decibels, a noise level comparable to an alarm clock or a busy city street. When noise levels reach 90 decibels, these types of stethoscopes are rendered useless.

Modern electronic stethoscopes have raised the maximum tolerable noise level of 90 decibels to 95 decibels by replacing the ear pieces with loudspeaker inserts that provide a better seal with the ear canal and by replacing the tubing with electrical cables that do not pick up acoustic noise.

The challenge to build a better stethoscope originated from the Army's Small Business Innovation Research program. For soldiers wounded in combat, the first hour after sustaining an injury is known as the "critical hour," when diagnoses and emergency treatment must take place to give them the best chance of recovery. These soldiers are often transported by helicopter, where noise levels prohibit the use of traditional stethoscopes.

Auscultation is an important tool in assessing the integrity of the heart muscle, valves and major arteries.

Lead researcher Adrian Houtsma said traditional stethoscopes transmitted and amplified sound that was within the range of human hearing, from about 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz. Most audible sound, including that of the heart and lungs, takes place at around 100 hertz to 200 hertz.

The ultrasound models transmit a sound signal at 2.3 megahertz into the patient's body. This sound is reflected back to the stethoscope at a slightly different frequency because of the velocity of the internal organs. This is called the Doppler effect.

The difference in frequencies between the sound wave that is transmitted and the sound wave that is received can be computed to determine the motion of the internal organs. This different frequency is then converted into audible sound.

Because they are based on different physical principles to conventional stethoscopes, ultrasound models produce a markedly different sound. Where an acoustic stethoscope yields a "lub-dub" sound from a heartbeat, with the first beat being the strongest, an ultrasound stethoscope will yield a "ta-da-ta" pattern, with the second beat being the strongest.

Houtsma expects this invention to save many lives that otherwise might have been lost.

The ultrasound stethoscopes are nearly ready to begin the process of FDA approval, which is likely to take two to three months. Active Signal Technologies will then begin manufacturing the devices to sell to the armed forces.

The company's chief executive officer, Arthur Cooke, said the commercial release of the stethoscopes would likely be very small at first, since the cost could be anywhere between 250 dollars and 700 dollars.

He hoped that positive feedback from the armed forces would generate widespread interest.
