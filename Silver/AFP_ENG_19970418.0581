Yugoslav film-maker Emir Kusturica is to start work at the end of next month on a comedy with a gypsy background set in Serbia, he said here Friday.

The film, entitled "Black Cat, White Cat," will cover the joyful attitude to death in the gypsy community, Kusturica said. It will recount the efforts of an old man's many relatives to restore him to life after he has died.

Kusturica has twice won the Golden Palm at the Cannes film festival, in 1985 for "When Father was away on Business," and in 1995 for the controversial "Underground," accused by critics of being too pro-Serb.

In between, he was voted best director at Cannes for an earlier gypsy film, "Time of the Gypsies."

Kusturica is currently making a short film on support for AIDS sufferers in Frankfurt. It is to be shown in two different versions, for cinema and for television.
