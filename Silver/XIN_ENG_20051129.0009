The onset of winter conditions in the earthquake areas of Pakistan has severely hampered the relief operations of the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations, resulting in the grounding of some helicopters and the cancellation of some road deliveries.

"This development shows why it is very important for us to do more and quickly too as we keep the focus on the relief phase," said the UN's chief of Emergency Operations, Andrew MacLeod, here on Tuesday. "It also shows why Operation Winter Race still remains so important."

Operation Winter Race has been designed to provide urgently needed shelter to thousands of people between 5,000 and 7,000 feet of altitude before the onset of winter, according to the UN. It has so far resulted in the construction of more than 19,000 shelter units by the military and another 40,000 by the humanitarian community and Pakistan civil society.

"Even as winter threatens people's health and safety, the race is not lost - it is just more difficult. We need ongoing and additional support in the next few days so we could reach as many of the remaining vulnerable people as possible," the UN Emergency Operations chief said.

Since the earthquake struck on Oct. 8, the UN and its partners in the NGO and humanitarian community have been racing against time to provide food, shelter, clothing and medicine to the estimated 3.5 million affected people.

But rain and snow in some parts of the earthquake zone coupled with significant drops in temperature have made the relief operations particularly difficult and increased the numbers seeking medical assistance for weather related ailments. Some roads have been closed completely and others have been declared unsafe.

"Even as sufficient pledges have been made for recovery and reconstruction, relief is still less than 50 percent funded. And now, and winter and nature are reminding us: 'Concentrate on relief in order to save lives, reconstruct later.'" Andrew MacLeod stressed.
