In the escalating battle for control of German auto giant Volkswagen, the regional state authorities of Lower Saxony are seeking support from other shareholders versus luxury sports car maker Porsche, the Financial Times reported on Monday.

Lower Saxony's regional premier Christian Wulff is to meet leading institutional investors early next year to gauge whether to fight Porsche's increasing influence over VW, the newspaper said, quoting shareholders.

Porsche has recently become VW's largest shareholder and is seeking three or four seats on the car maker's supervisory board, including the chairmanship, instead of two.

The meetings with investors are likely before a supervisory board meeting in February, the last sitting before board nominations are made at the group's annual meeting in April, FT said.

If Wulff secures key investor support, the simmering conflict between Lower Saxony, VW's second-biggest shareholder, and Porsche, could escalate further, the newspaper said.
