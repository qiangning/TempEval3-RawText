Chile's former strongman Augusto Pinochet was reported to be gravely ill Sunday, after a massive heart attack.

"His fate is in the hands of God and his doctors," said the former dictator's youngest son, Marco Antonio Pinochet Hiriart.

Juan Ignacio Vergara, a doctor treating the retired general, said Pinochet's life is "in danger."

A family spokesman, Guillermo Garin, said Sunday that a Catholic priest had given Pinochet the last rites administered when a gravely ill person is in imminent danger of death, adding that Pinochet remains conscious and in stable condition.

Pinochet, 91, was brought to Santiago Military Hospital shortly after 2:00 am (0600 GMT) on Sunday, and immediately underwent angioplasty -- a procedure desiged to widen a narrowed or obstructed blood vessel.

The elderly ex-dictator, who has been under house arrest off and on for the past few years, was again placed under house arrest last week by a judge investigating the disappearance of two of the thousands of people who went missing under his regime.

Pinochet ruled Chile for 17 years after seizing power in a 1973 military coup. Accused of fraud and human rights abuses during his 1973-1990 regime, Pinochet was first ordered under house arrest in late October on other charges only to be released on parole a few days later in deference to his advanced age and ill health.

The latest arrest warrant by judge Victor Montiglio is linked to the disappearance of two security guards of socialist president Salvador Allende, who committed suicide during the September 1973 military coup.

The guards disappeared during the notorious "Caravan of Death," an effort by a band of Chilean soldiers to purge the country of regime opponents shortly after the coup, killing 75 people.

Montiglio's arrest warrant was issued two days after Pinochet's 91st birthday celebrations, at which his wife read a message saying that the former dictator held "no grudge against anyone," despite all the "persecutions and injustices" against him.

During his birthday celebration, the ailing ex-dictator sat in a wheelchair outside his home, managed a faint smile and lifted his hand to wave to scores of followers gathered outside his house in La Dahesa, one of Santiago's poshest neighborhoods.

"I will gladly withstand all the humiliation, persecution and injustices my family and I have suffered in the name of peace and harmony, which should reign among Chileans," said the message.

But Pinochet was unapologetic for toppling the elected Socialist government of Salvador Allende, saying that thanks to the courage and decisiveness of the armed forces, "Chile avoided the totalitarian threat and found true democracy, which we re-established, and which all our countrymen enjoy."

Dozens of Pinochet's men are behind bars in Chile for killing and torturing some 3,000 persons, by official count, under his rule

But Pinochet has yet to face trial for any crime. His lawyers have so far persuaded the Supreme Court in each case that the retired general was unable to defend himself because he suffered a "mild dementia," the only condition available to him that Chilean courts accept to avoid trial.

Last month, Pinochet was charged with alleged crimes at Villa Grimaldi, a secret jail where Michelle Bachelet, now president of Chile, was once tortured, along with her mother, for a month in 1975.

Pinochet has also been charged in connection with Operation Colombo, an international effort to murder 119 regime opponents and spirit the bodies to other South American countries ruled by military regimes in July 1975.

His eldest daughter, Lucia Pinochet Hiriart, 67, said on November 16 that Pinochet "feels the pain" of victims under his regime, but was not ready to ask for their pardon publicly.

She and her mother are not allowed to leave Chile because of investigations of a hundred bank accounts that members of the Pinochet family opened in the United States and other countries, prosecutors say, to avoid taxes.

The accounts came to light after a US Senate investigation of Riggs Bank in Washington.

Chileans remain deeply divided over the dictatorship, which ended when Pinochet lost a 1988 referendum on his continued rule and handed over power in 1990 to a transitional government.
