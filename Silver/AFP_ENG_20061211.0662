The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in the northwest US state of Oregon has settled with around 150 people claiming they were abused by priests, authorities said Monday.

Oregon District Court Judge Michael Hogan, who mediated in the case, said in a statement those seeking damages had dropped their lawsuits after agreeing settlement with church authorities.

No figure for the settlement was revealed and parties in the case have been forbidden from discussing the deal in public.

The Portland Archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in 2004 as it staggered under a 135 million-dollar lawsuit claiming sexual abuse by members of its clergy.

The Roman Catholic Church in the United States has been rocked by clergy pedophilia scandals in recent years.

Several priests have been convicted and four dioceses have gone bankrupt after being ordered to pay huge civil penalties and interest.

Earlier this month, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said it had agreed to pay 60 million dollars to settle accusations by 45 people that they were sexually abused by priests.
