The prosecution in the trial of former East German military officials held responsible for the deaths of people killed trying to flee to the West called Friday for the court to impose prison sentences.

A sentence of four years was demanded for the former deputy defence minister Joachim Goldbach, with lesser sentences for three other generals.

The four are accused of complicity in murder and attempted murder over defence ministry "shoot-to-kill" orders given to guards on the Berlin Wall and the installation of automatic firing apparatus along the inter-German border.

Such installations were not for the military defence of the East German state but directed entirely against the population, the prosecutor said.

Five former border guard officers meanwhile went on trial in Berlin Friday accused of installing particularly deadly fragmentation mines along the frontier with West Germany. Nine people were killed and numerous others wounded by these mines, the court heard.

More than seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the number of people killed in all trying to escape from East Germany is not known exactly, but according to a specialist body there were more than 860 who died in this way.
