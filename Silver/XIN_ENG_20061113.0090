SunTech Medical Inc, one of the world leaders in blood pressure monitoring products and technology, announced here Monday the opening of its Hong Kong office.

As SunTech's first Asian venture, the Hong Kong operation will be responsible for providing a full range of sales and marketing support to its distributors throughout the Asia-Pacific region, according to Anthony Nixon, the Regional Director of SunTech Medical in Hong Kong.

"Sales operations associated with our medical devices have previously been based only in the UK and the United States. As our business grows in this region, it has become strategically important to establish a base here in order to be immediately available and responsive to the needs of our customers, both in Hong Kong and the rest of this region," Anthony Nixon said.

Commenting on the choice of Hong Kong as its regional hub, Nixon said, "We firmly believe that Hong Kong is the epicenter for Asian market development. Chinese mainland's rise as a major consumer and manufacturer further prompted SunTech Medical to operate directly in this booming market. The business-friendly environment and the great ease of setting up and operating a business in Hong Kong are among the city's many advantages."

Founded in 1984, SunTech Medical is a wholly owned subsidiary of SunTech Medical Group Limited which is a privately-owned British company. It develops and markets clinical grade blood pressure measurement devices and operates from bases in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and Oxford, UK.
