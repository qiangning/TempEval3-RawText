Palestinian and Egyptian officials will sign a final deal to provide Gaza Strip with Egyptian electricity instead of some Israeli power, a Gaza power company announced on Saturday.

The Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDC) made the announcement in a statement issued by its general director Sulaiman Abu Samhadana.

According to the deal, a switching station would be built in southern Gaza Strip border town of Rafah to receive 150 megawatt of Egyptian power as the first phase, said the statement.

The first phase costs about 22 million U.S. dollars, said the statement, adding the four-phase project would provide Gaza with 800 megawatt when it is completed. It would be built completely in one year if Israel did not put obstacles.

The proposed Gaza switching plant would be connected with an Egyptian station in al-Ariesh city with 60 km-long cables. Fixing the cables will cost about 100 millions of Egyptian Pound (17.39 million dollars).

On June 28, three days after Palestinian militants kidnapped an Israeli soldier, Israeli F-16 warplanes have shelled the only power plant in Gaza that produced almost 45 percent of Gaza electricity, leaving the poor strip powerless for three months until Egyptians have recently re-operated the Gaza station.

Through 10 cables, Israel provides Gaza with the remaining electricity.

Abu Samhadana said the project will cover the shortage of power in Gaza for decades.
