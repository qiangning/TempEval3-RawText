The Greek government ruled out on Tuesday the withdrawal of its troops stationed in Afghanistan, noting that they were there at the request of the United Nations and that Greece "has obligations that it must observe".

Government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said that Greece had sent one company of 128 men from the army engineers' corps to support road building networks and provide humanitarian and public benefit services and, since August this year, an additional 45 troops to provide services to the 291st mobile hospital.

From Dec. 1, meanwhile, another 44 Greek Air force officers will be sent to the area to take over the rotating command of Kabul airport.

Also in the day, members of the "Stop the War" coalition held a protest outside the Greek defense ministry in Athens over the presence of Greek troops among the NATO mission in Afghanistan.

The protest was organized only one day after two Greek soldiers stationed in Afghanistan were injured during an attack on a Greek convoy outside Kabul.

Alexandros Magakis, a former minister under main opposition PASOK, told reporters that the injury of the two soldiers highlighted in the most dramatic way the dangers of escalating Greece's involvement in the US war on Afghanistan.

One anti-war activist accused the Greek government of sending troops to Afghanistan, saying that the government shared the guilt and responsibility for Bush's crimes.
