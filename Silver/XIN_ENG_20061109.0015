The net profit of China's listed companies is expected to grow by more than 30 percent year on year in 2006, according to Peng Yan, economist with Guotai Junan Securities.

China's listed companies in the first three quarters this year saw growth of about 21 percent in net profits, two percent higher than that of the revenues of their major operations.

Analysts say the figures reflect the companies' tighter cost controls which grew 9.93 percent in the first three quarters, 1.22 percentage points higher than the same period last year.

"The performance of the listed companies is expected to grow steadily in next two or three years to reflect the less cyclic fluctuations of the micro economy and the businesses," said Peng.

Statistics with the China Merchants Securities show the profit margin declined steadily from 22.11 percent in 2002 to 17.69 percent in the first three quarters this year, 5.14 percent lower than the same period last year.
