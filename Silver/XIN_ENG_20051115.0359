A UN senior official has warned Tuesday that some 2,000 children are drawn into child sex rings in Greece each year, adding that the Greek government must implement a national policy to protect the rights of minors.

"Greece has made significant progress in the area of human rights during the last decade, but this has to be continued, especially as far as children's rights are concerned," said Juan Miguel Petit, the special rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, quoted by the local English-language daily Kathimerini.

Concluding a six-day trip to Greece, the UN official highlighted shortcomings in Greece's protection of minors, such as the conditions in which Gypsy children live near the center of Athens.

The district is to be redeveloped into a new football stadium as home to Athens Panathinakos club, despite concerns of human rights groups over the forced relocation of families living in the area.

The conditions children had to endure were unacceptable. Most of the 400 children who left Albania on their own last year ended up in Greece, often with the help of traffickers, Petit said.

The UN official recommended that the Albanian and Greek governments should cooperate more closely over the issue.

He also advised the creation of a central body that would oversee the creation of a coherent policy on children's rights in Greece, so the current overlapping between state organizations would be avoided.

Meanwhile, Lambros Kanellopoulos, head of UNICEF's office in Greece, revealed that research had shown some 2,000 children are being sexually exploited by organized gangs in various parts of the country.
