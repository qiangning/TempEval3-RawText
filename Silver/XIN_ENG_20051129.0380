Slaughterhouses will be moved out of the Thai capital to prevent possible spread of bird flu from poultry to people, local press reported Wednesday.

After inspecting abattoirs and stalls selling poultry meat in the Yaowarat area, Bangkok's Chinatown, Tuesday, Thai Public Health Minister Phinij Jarusombat said slaughterhouses are major sources of the bird flu virus and pose a grave risk for both area residents and passers-by.

"Unhygienic slaughtering practices are the prime cause of human infections by the H5N1 bird flu virus as slaughters, poultry sellers and buyers are all in close contact with the birds," he was quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying.

Among 57 poultry slaughterhouses in Bangkok, 19 are in Wattana district where traders are in direct contact with chickens without wearing any protective gear such as gloves and gowns.

As part of the national bird flu prevention scheme, the ministry plans to set up poultry slaughterhouses on the outskirts of Bangkok and placing them under strict sanitary control.

The traditional practice of buying freshly killed poultry for cooking will also be banned in a bid to avert the transmission of bird flu virus, the report said.

The Public Health Ministry and other agencies, including the Livestock Development Department and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, will join hands to draft a plan to control all slaughterhouses in the capital as soon as possible, said Phinij.
