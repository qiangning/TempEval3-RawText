The city's normal water consumption for residential use is estimated at 700,000 tons a day, noted Liu Yuzhu, a senior executive manager of the Harbin Water Supply and Drainage Group. Co. Ltd., saying that a sizeable proportion of the water supply was consumed by such commercial service sectors, such as car washing and bathing, which have been temporarily closed on the order of the government. Water for domestic use use has been placed as priority by the government.

Before the execution of water stoppage at wee hours Wednesday, said Liu, 90 percent of local residents stored up water enough for three-day use. The total amount of water stored by local residents is estimated at 300,000 tons, according to the company's research.

Luan Xizhong, manager of Walmart Northeast China Region, said that frenzy shoppers nearly emptied Walmart's chainstore located in Zhongshan Avenue in downtown Harbin two days ago. But now it has been refilled with sufficient food and beverage stuff.

"Our order of 30,000 boxes of bottled mineral water arrived today , and there is no need for buying spree," Luan told Xinhua.

But there are some stores speculating on the public fears of water shortage.

A student with the Harbin Industrial University told Xinhua that some stores are raising prices of mineral water. "The price of a dozen bottles of a brand mineral water rose from 12 yuan (1.5 US dollars) to over 20 yuan (2.5 US dollars) in two days," said Zhao Yingqiang, a Harbin resident.

In response to the public complaint, Wang Lianjia, an official of provincial pricing authorities, said that price rises were separated cases. As long as the government ensures sufficient market supply of drinking water, the price would ebb and return to the normal level in a couple of days.

As part of its bid to stabilize the market price of drinking water, the municipal government has allocated 5 million yuan (625,000 US dollars) to set up five water stations in the city to provide barreled water at standard market price.

Li Gang, a Harbin resident, seen standing in a line outside a public toilet, told Xinhua his family members would use the public toilet in the next few days so as to save water for toilet flushing.

"It is not a big problem for just a few days and it is of little troubles in daily life," he said.
