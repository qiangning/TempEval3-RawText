Last year set a new record for capital punishment with more than 7,000 death sentences being passed and more than 4,000 carried out, 3,500 of them in China, Amnesty International said Friday.

The human rights organisation welcomed a move by the UN Human Rights Commission which called Thursday on countries which still have the death penalty to limit executions.

The resolution condemning capital punishment was adopted despite opposition from a number of countries, including China, Japan and the United States.

Passed by 27 votes to 11, it also called on countries still practising state-sponsored execution to spare adolescents under 18 and pregnant women.

Amnesty underlined that in countries where the death penalty is most frequently applied, executions often followed unfair trials with convictions often based on confessions obtained by force from prisoners denied legal access.

At least 4,272 prisoners were executed in 39 countries last year, while a further 7,017 people were sentenced to death in 76 countries, Amnesty said.

The figures -- which only represent part of the true number of death sentences and executions -- mark an increase of 30 percent on 1995, when 3,276 prisoners were executed and 4,165 sentenced to death.

This great leap forward is largely attributed to an anti-crime campaign launched in China last April. Amnesty recorded 3,500 executions in China, most victims being hastily dispatched at the conclusion of dubious trials.

In Ukraine 169 prisoners were executed, at least 140 in Russia, and more than 110 in Iran.

The above four countries between them account for 92 percent of all executions in the world last year.

Unconfirmed statistics attribute 123 executions to Turkmenistan, and Iraq is also believed to have implemented numerous death sentences.

In the United States, at least 3,150 prisoners were on death row in September 1996, with 45 death sentences being passed in the course of the year.

However, despite the increase in executions, Amnesty noted a growing tendency for countries to abolish capital punishment.

Belgium was the latest country to do so, bringing to 58 the number of countries that have totally renounced the punishment.

A futher 15 countries have abolished the death penalty except for extraordinary crimes, and 27 countries with the penalty still in their legislation have suspended all executions for 10 years.

More than half the world's nations have now either abolished or no longer practice the death penalty, Amnesty said.
