Seattle SuperSonics forward Danny Fortson was suspended one game by the National Basketball Association here Saturday for a series of violations during a victory Friday at Utah.

Fortson was banished for verbally abusing a referee, failing to leave the court in a timely manner after being ejected and knocking over a water cooler while leaving.

The incident came with nine minutes and 13 seconds to play in the fourth quarter of Seattle's 106-90 victory.

Fortson was whistled for a loose ball foul after having been whistled for three fouls and a technical foul in seven minutes. He argued the call and was ejected.

Teammates restrained Forston as he pressed his case to referee Matt Boland. Fortson, who tossed a chair that nearly hit a fan following an ejection last season, dumped a water cooler on his way into the locker room.

Fortson forfeited 71,277 dollars in salary by missing Seattle's game Saturday against Sacramento. He averages 3.5 points, 2.8 rebounds and 3.6 fouls a game.
