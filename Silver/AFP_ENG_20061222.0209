Japan urged Russia on Friday to be "responsible" but said it was confident it would receive gas supplies as planned after Moscow took control of the massive Sakhalin-2 project from British and Japanese companies.

Japan, which has few natural resources of its own, is the primary market for the gas from the 22 billion-dollar project off Russia's east coast, which would have been the world's biggest privately financed energy project.

"We want the Russian side to take responsible policies," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki told a news conference in Tokyo.

"Our country relies on energy resources from abroad. It is important to see the project go ahead smoothly to secure energy resources and provide stable supply," said Shiozaki, the government spokesman.

On Thursday, Russia's state-run Gazprom secured control of the project and agreed to pay 7.45 billion dollars to the consortium led by Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell.

Shell and its two Japanese partners, trading houses Mitsui and Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. will become minority owners.

The project had been halted when Russia accused the companies of environmental violations, a move widely seen by foreign investors as a way for the government to muscle in and take control.

But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the latest deal.

"It means a lot that Japan secured the energy supply from Russia," he told reporters.

"I would like to use diplomacy to diversify the sources of energy and ensure stable supply," Abe said.

Japan's oil supply comes almost exclusively from the Middle East, whose turbulence is a constant worry for businesses and policymakers here.

"The signed contract ensures a stable supply for Japan's domestic demands, which I highly value," Akira Amari, Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry, said of the Gazprom deal.

"The Japanese government has been sending Russia its requests through diplomatic routes," he added.

Japan had previously warned Russia that a failure to receive gas from the project would set back overall bilateral relations.

Asked whether Russia made the environmental allegations to gain control of the project, Amari said: "I feel that way but I cannot assert it in my position (as trade minister)."

Russia was infuriated when the Sakhalin-2 announced a doubling of costs for the project. Under the original production sharing agreement, the state was only to receive a share of the profits after the group recouped its investment.

The two Japanese companies said in a joint statement that they will "make utmost efforts to ensure liquified energy gas supply as scheduled to existing customers in Japan, South Korea and the west coast of the United States."

"In addition, Gazprom and the three existing shareholders reaffirmed to do our best to solve the issue of the approval and license," they said in a joint statement, in an indirect reference to the environmental allegations.

Risk assessment agency Standard and Poor's said the share transfer would not affect the ratings of Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui -- and that if anything they would benefit.

"Difficulties in negotiations with the Russian government had increased uncertainty over Mitsubishi and Mitsui and Co's investment in the Sakhalin-2 project," it said.

The risks "may recede due to Gazprom's participation in the project."
