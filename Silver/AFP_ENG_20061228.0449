Somali government forces backed by Ethiopian troops, tanks and aircraft rolled into the capital Mogadishu Thursday after Islamist leaders retreated but vowed to launch a guerrilla campaign.

"We are already inside Mogadishu in some areas," Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi told reporters in Afgoye township, about 20 kilometres (13 miles) west of the coastal city, where he had been sounding out local chiefs.

"We are starting to establish the security in Mogadishu. Everyone who has guns or armed militia will have to surrender them to the government," he said.

"I am neither a warlord nor an Islamist, I just want to do my duty."

There were no independent assessments of casualties but Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi claimed up to 3,000 dead on the side of the Islamic Courts Union, and that the number of wounded could number up to 5,000.

The Islamists claimed hundreds of government troops had died. AFP correspondents saw huge numbers of bodies at battlefields in central and southern Somalia.

The entry into the capital came nine days after Ethiopian forces had defied pressure from other African nations by openly putting their air power and heavy artillery behind Somalia's government, which had been left in control of just one town -- Baidoa -- after an Islamist onslaught earlier this year.

The Islamists, who had seized Mogadishu and most of Somalia from US-backed warlords, are perceived as a direct threat by Addis Ababa and are accused by Washington of having links with al-Qaeda.

Washington, for its part, steered clear Thursday of condemning Ethiopia for its involvement, saying Meles's government had legitimate security concerns.

"I saw government troops in north Mogadishu. They have fully entered the town. People were cheering and shouting 'Welcome our government'," said local resident Nur Dirie.

"I am telling you that I also saw Ethiopian forces enter, (they) are now in (Mogadishu district) Suuqaholaha," Dirie added. Another witness counted around 50 Ethiopian armoured vehicles.

As Islamist forces retreated from Mogadishu, pro-government fighters took control of its international airport, sea port and presidential palace, but Gedi and his government halted outside the city for consultations with religious, clan and civil society leaders before moving any further.

Deputy prime minister Mohamed Hussein Aidid, one of several powerful Mogadishu warlords uprooted when Islamic Courts Union took control of the capital in June, said the government would enter the city of about a million people on Friday.

"It is a day of reconciliation and victory (and) a day of the return of law and order," Aidid said.

His optimism was not unanimously shared in the city, however, where many fear renewed lawlessness after a relatively quiet six months under strict Islamist rule.

"We have been living peacefully for the last six months, but I think hell has broken loose and killing will be back," said resident Hashim Jeele Hassan.

The Islamists, meanwhile, acknowledged retreating but vowed to launch a guerrilla war against the Western-backed government.

Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, head of the executive committee of the Supreme Islamic Council of Somalia (SICS), told Al-Jazeera television that "we have withdrawn our forces (from Mogadishu) and there are no Islamic Court forces."

"It is the Somali people who are resisting," he added. "We did not leave the capital to chaos. We left it to avert heavy bombing because Ethiopian forces are practicing genocide against the Somali people."

As government and Ethiopian troops entered the city, many Islamist fighters swapped their uniforms for civilian clothing and removed their turbans.

"Islamic forces turning into local militias," said Shadiyo Gure Ali, a businesswoman forced to close her shop.

Somalia disintegrated into lawlessness after the 1991 ouster of a dictator, when it was carved up among warlords and has since lacked a central government and defied all international bids to restore functioning institutions of state.

Meles said his forces would pull out "hopefully in the next few days, maybe in the next few weeks, but definitely not months... While we are there, we will help them try to stabilize Mogadishu. We will not let Mogadishu burn."

In Washington, the United States called for a resumption of power-sharing negotiations between Somalia's rival factions, saying that a stable government could not be achieved through violence.

"We remain concerned about the situation there," State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said. "You're going to have to have that government established on the basis of discussions and dialogue."
