The United States said on Monday that it hopes the six-party talks aimed at addressing the nuclear issue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) could resume as soon as possible.

"Certainly, we're looking forward to having those talks reconvene at the earliest possible date," State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said at a briefing.

However, "I don't have a specific date yet to offer you," Casey said.

"I think we're still looking to see when that's going to be possible," Casey added.

The DPRK said on Nov. 1 that it had decided to return to the six-party talks, but did not offer a specific date.

The six-party talks, which involve the United States, the DPRK, China, Russia, South Korea and Japan, and are aimed at persuading the DPRK to abandon its nuclear programs, have been stalled since last November.
