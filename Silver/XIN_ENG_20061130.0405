Mexico's president-elect Felipe Calderon, of the ruling National Action Party (PAN), named on Thursday the last four cabinet ministers who will assist him in his six-year term to start on Dec. 1.

Calderon named Eduardo Medina Mora as Attorney General, Genaro Garcia Luna as Public Security Minister, Guillermo Galvan Galvan as Minister of National Defense and Mariano Francisco Sainez Mendoza as Navy Minister.

Twelve other cabinet ministers were appointed earlier this week.

The appointment of Francisco Javier Ramirez Acuna as Interior Minister sparked controversy as there have been allegations of heavy-handed policing during his previous term as governor of the western Mexican state of Jalisco.

Human rights groups have accused Ramirez of turning a blind eye to allegations of abusive and aggressive tactics by Jalisco police.

His most prominent appointment, Finance Minister Agustin Carstens, was former number three at the International Monetary Fund.

Only one official was ratified in his post: Tourism Minister Rodolfo Elizondo.
