During the demonstration the students displayed banners that included calls for a boycott of the May 29 general elections, a demand for a new party and a new president and support for ousted opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daily said.

Student sources here however, said Thursday that eight other students were arrested Wednesday in Yogyakarta after calling for the release of their 24 colleagues.
