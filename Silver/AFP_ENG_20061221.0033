Australian share prices closed down 0.43 percent Thursday, retreating from Wednesday's record highs as investors sold resource stocks after metal prices fell in overnight trading, dealers said.

They said profit taking also weighed on the local market while rises in banking stocks provided support.

The benchmark SP/ASX 200 fell 24.3 points to 5,583.5 from yesterday's record high of 5,607.8, while the broader All Ordinaries Index shed 25.2 points to 5,561.7, from Wednesday's record high of 5,586.9.
