Marked by the absence of most Arabic leaders, the Euromed summit, which concluded on Monday with a watered-down "code of conduct" on terrorism and a vague action plan on immigration and reform, reflected the profound difficulties in bridging the gap between the two rims of the Mediterranean, said an Arabic observer.

All but two leaders of the Mediterranean-rim partners -- Turkey and the Palestinian Authority -- joined the summit, which aimed to re-launch the so-called Barcelona Process set up to strengthen cooperation on peace, security, economic development and social cohesion between both shores of the Mediterranean sea.

On defining terrorism, Arab nations insisted on noting the differences between terrorism and the right to resist occupation, while Israel and several EU countries wanted an explicit statement that terrorism could never be justified by any cause.

The summit ended without going beyond pledges to implement in full all United Nations Security Council resolutions addressing the issue of terrorism, while ensuring respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law.

For British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, the statement was "as strong as you could possibly have on a unified determination to fight terrorism in all its forms."

Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero also qualified the code of conduct as "energetic and unprecedented."

But another comment from Zapatero, inadvertently picked up by closed-door session microphones, and widely cited by the press, said the contrary -- "A text must be agreed, come what may."

On the issue of migration, a five-year program was agreed to reduce illegal immigration and crack down on human traffickers while "promoting legal immigration opportunities."

The European Commission hoped the summit defined a "shared vision" to give "fresh impetus" to the issue. However, the North-African countries complained that they did not have sufficient tools to enhance border control and demanded more financial compensation for cooperation on combating illegal immigration.

Critics also pointed out that the disputes on terrorism and immigration overshadowed other pressing issues, such as economic cooperation and development, which was of greater importance for the Arabic states.

"There is a deep-seated divergence of views: the Southern states are asking for more aid whereas the north wants to link that to further advances in democracy and good-government," said the Barcelona-based Spanish daily Vanguardia in an editorial.

The Muslim leaders were not keen to hear European lectures on democratic reform and the need for elections, an Arabic diplomat told Xinhua reporter.

The summit's lack of concessions for Arabic leaders suggested that Europe, long seen as a greater ally to the Muslim world than the pro-Israel United States, might be losing some of its influence, warned the diplomat.

For European analysts, the Europeans were lacking the instrument of economic diplomacy.

Without agreement on the EU financial perspective for 2007-2013, French President Jacques Chirac could only confirm that the funds destined for the region "would not decrease" under the next financial framework.

A new 1.5-billion-euro (about 1.8 billion US dollars) financing facility from the European Investment Bank, intended for the private sector in the South Mediterranean, was the only "new" money put on the table in Barcelona.
