The UN Security Council on Friday called on all parties in the run-off presidential election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to remain calm and avoid violence as they wait for the final results.

"The members of the Security Council appealed to the sense of civic responsibility of the Congolese people, so that the electoral process could continue in a calm and peaceful climate," the 15-nation council said in a press statement read out by Jorge Voto-Bernales, Peru's UN ambassador and the council president for this month.

Stressing that electoral disputes should be settled only through legal procedures, the council urged the parties not to challenge the outcome of the polls by force.

The statement condemned the violent incident that took place in Kinshasa on Nov. 11, in which four people lost their lives, calling on all political actors to refrain from any provocation, incitement to hatred or recourse to violence.

The council "stressed that neither the Congolese people nor the international community would understand or accept a return to violence following the election," it said.

Incumbent President Joseph Kabila had won the presidential run- off held on Oct. 29, defeating Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba, according to results announced by the country's electoral commission Wednesday.

In a three-month-long electoral process meant to cement the country's transition to stability from a six-year civil war, the Congolese people also voted to elect a 500-seat National Assembly and provincial assemblies.
