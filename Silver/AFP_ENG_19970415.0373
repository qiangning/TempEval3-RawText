The head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) will see for himself the progress China has made to pave the way for its entry into the group, China's foreign ministry spokesman Shen Goufang said Tuesday.

The coming visit by WTO secretary general Renato Ruggiero would "allow the two sides to get to know each other better and the WTO can take the opportunity to see what China thinks and does," Shen said.

Ruggiero is due to visit China from Friday until April 23 for further negotiations on the country's entry into the WTO.

Shen repeated Beijing's position that "China has already fulfilled all the conditions of admission" into the multi-lateral body.

"We hope that the United States and western countries will put aside political reasons," which have so far blocked Beijing's bid for entry and treat the country "in a realistic fashion."

Ruggiero said last month in Tokyo negotiations for Beijing's entry into the WTO were about to enter their final phase without setting a timetable.

China's candidacy to the General Agreements on Trade and Tarrifs (GATT) which preceded the WTO, was blocked because of differences on the criteria for admission.

The United States maintains the Chinese economy is not comparable because of its size to those of developping countries and has demanded Beijing meet the conditions of entry applied to industralised countries and lift its customs duties.
