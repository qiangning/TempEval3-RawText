An incident involving a convoy of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) killed an Afghan civilian and injured four others near Kabul of Afghanistan, an ISAF statement said on Thursday.

A civilian van was observed driving "suspiciously" near the convoy on the Bagram road, north of Kabul, on Wednesday morning, it said, adding "ISAF troops signaled for the vehicle to stop and fired a number of bullets."

"The driver subsequently lost control of the van and unfortunately crashed," the statement said, adding one civilian was killed and four others injured as a result.

The vague statement didn't say whether the civilians killed and injured were the van's occupants or just passers-by, nor said whether the bullets were shot toward the vehicle or just warning ones.

It is also unclear whether the driver lost control of the vehicle because he was shot or only out of scare.

However, local daily newspaper Outlook quoted Alishal Paktiawal, criminal director of Kabul police, as saying ISAF troops "shot dead one civilian and wounded four others, one of them seriously" in the incident.

The killed one, a resident from the eastern Laghman province, was working at a health facility in Bagram U.S. military base, about 50 km north of Kabul, it added.

The ISAF statement said the casualties were quickly taken to a military hospital in Kabul for treatment, and a senior U.S. commander Benjamin C. Freakley had demanded a "detailed and thorough investigation" into the incident.

The investigation is currently ongoing and the Afghan government will be informed of the results as soon as they are available, it added.

Similar incidents have happened in Afghanistan from time to time before.

On Nov. 15, an ISAF patrol killed two adult civilians and injured a child in the southern Helmand province as their van approached the patrol fast and failed to stop when hand signals were given.

On Aug. 22, ISAF fired bullets toward two boys on a motorbike, killing one of them, in Kandahar city, capital of the southern Kandahar province, shortly after a deadly suicide bombing, as they ignored ISAF's warning to stop.

Civilian casualties have damaged the image of ISAF and reduced their popularity among Afghans.

In a much more severe case, a NATO air strike killed up to 80 civilians in a village of Panjwai district of Kandahar province on Oct. 24, according to locals.

However, ISAF recently said a joint Afghan and NATO investigation found 31 civilians were killed in the incident, which has caused huge rage among locals.
