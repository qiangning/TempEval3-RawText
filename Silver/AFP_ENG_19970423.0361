A rasta-loving policeman who faces disciplinary action for wearing his hair in dreadlocks, has taken his case to the South African Human Rights Commission, officials said Wednesday.

D.P. Sass, a trumpet player in a police band, faces suspension or dismissal for sporting long, twisted tresses, but has protested the ruling on the grounds that it infringes on his religious freedoms, the SAPA news agency said Wednesday.

Sass became a follower of Rastafarianism (also known as 'rasta'), a philosophical movement originating in Jamaica and the Antilles, a year after joining the police in 1992, the commission said in a statement.

Police admit their regulations contradict Sass' religious rights, but say the measures are necessary in order to maintain standards of neatness and integrity, the commission added.

In a similar case, a Cape Town high school student appealed to the commission after his school refused to allow him to write exams because he would not hide his dreadlocks, the statement said.
