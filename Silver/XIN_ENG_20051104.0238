The mission in Afghanistan is becoming the most accident-prone and expensive deployment ever for the Dutch defense ministry, the De Volkskrant daily reported Friday.

Although Dutch troops in Afghanistan never exchanged fire with al-Qaeda or Taliban fighters, the Dutch air force lost some 80 million euro worth of equipment in the past year, a record for Dutch missions abroad, the paper said.

The Dutch air force confirmed that a second Chinook helicopter was written off after making an emergency landing in mountains north of Kabul on Monday, according to the paper, one of the biggest dailies in the Netherlands.

The 25-million-euro aircraft, en route to Dutch commandos in Kandahar, was forced to land for reasons not yet clear. Three of the 17 soldiers on board were wounded.

In July, a Chinook crashed near Kandahar. The Dutch defense ministry has ruled out the possibility that the aircraft was shot down by Taliban or al-Qaeda fighters.

The air force suffered its heaviest loss in August last year when a mis-communication resulted in the crash of a 30-million- euro Apache combat helicopter north of Kabul.

"It is never nice to lose so much equipment that is so crucial and scarce," an air force spokesperson was quoted as saying, adding that "luckily there have not been any wounded or dead so far."

As the Dutch mission in Afghanistan continues its dangerous operations, the air force risks losing more of its remaining 11 Chinooks, the paper said.
