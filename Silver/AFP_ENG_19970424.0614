Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp. plans to set up a joint venture in Thailand in May to process and market auto metal sheets in the country, a company spokesman said Friday.

MC Metal Service Asia Co Ltd., capitalised at 830 million yen (6.5 million dollars), will be owned 51 percent by Mitsubishi and the remaining 49 percent by Thai MC Co. Ltd. an affiliate of the major trading company, the spokesman said.

Total investment in the venture is estimated at 1.4 billion yen, including the construction of a plant near Bangkok, with production starting in December, the spokesman said.

The new plant will have annual capacity of 80,000 tonnes, equivalent to 400,000 passenger car units.

The venture plans to sell the product to Thai production units of Japanese carmakers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.

It also plans to supply other carmakers which have plans to start operations in Thailand, including Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., the spokesman added.
