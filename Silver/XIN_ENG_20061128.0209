The Sri Lankan government said Tuesday that it had asked the Norwegian peace facilitators and the Nordic truce monitors to clarify Tamil Tiger rebels' position on truce in the light of comments made by the rebel leader in his annual policy speech.

"We have asked both the Norwegian government and the SLMM (Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission) to clarify the stand on the cease-fire," Keheliya Rambukwella, the minister of Policy Planning and the government's defense spokesman told reporters.

The leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Velupillai Prabakaran in his speech delivered Monday said that the government's use of military power in the Tamil regions has rendered the 2002 cease-fire agreement (CFA) brokered by the Norwegians "defunct".

Prabakaran also said that the government's action "has effectively buried the CFA."

The rebel leader said the actions of the majority Sinhala governments had led the rebels with only one option: an independent state for the Tamil people. He appealed to the international community to "recognize our freedom struggle."

Rambukwella said despite the rebel leader's pronouncement to resume the independence struggle after six years of peace negotiations, the government was committed to furthering the process of negotiations and would keep the window opened for the LTTE to return to talks.

The LTTE leader's policy speech has renewed fears of full scale war resuming in the island's Northern and Eastern provinces.

Norway's peace effort began in 2000 saw the LTTE and the government meeting face to face eight times for negotiations since 2002.

The process became marred by high cost of violence with the government, saying that over 3,000 people died in the conflict between December 2005 and October 2006.

More than 60,000 have been killed in Sri Lanka since the LTTE launched its separatist campaign in the mid-1980s.
