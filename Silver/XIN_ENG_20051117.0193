Seasonally adjusted jobless rate in Hong Kong fell to a four-year low of 5.3 percent in the August-October period, the Census & Statistics Department said Thursday.

The figure was down from 5.5 percent in the July-September period, the department said in a report, adding that the underemployment rate also dropped, from 2.6 percent to 2.5 percent.

During past three months, the number of unemployed dropped by 12,700 to 193,000 -- the first time in four years the number has fallen below the 200,000 mark. The number of underemployed also dropped, from 95,000 to 90,000.

Meanwhile, total employment grew by 24,400 to an all-time high of 3,416,000, with total labor force rising to 3,609,000 from 3,597,300.

The department said a drop in unemployment was seen in the restaurant, hotel, manufacturing, decoration and maintenance, and transport sectors, while underemployment rate falls were mainly seen in foundation and superstructure construction, restaurant and miscellaneous personal-services sectors.

The jobless situation improved because employment growth continued to outstrip labor-force growth, the department added.

In the first 10 months, the Labor Department received 356,878 private-sector vacancies, up 20 percent over the full-year figure of 297,186 in 2004.

In the same period, the department placed 93,029 job-seekers into jobs, up 8 percent over the full-year figure of 86,257 in 2004.

The near-term outlook will depend on the state of business activity and job creation in the corporate sector in the run-up to the Christmas and New Year holidays, the report said.
