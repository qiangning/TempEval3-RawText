Singapore Airlines (SIA) will start flying to Russia in March with the launch of a service to the capital Moscow, the flag carrier said Thursday.

The airline will fly three times a week via Dubai using the Boeing 777-200 aircraft, SIA said in a statement.

The service will enhance already emerging business and leisure ties between Russia and Singapore, the airline said.

"Russia is a growing trading partner with the region," SIA said.

Announcing plans for the Russian service last October, SIA's general manager in Russia, Jayaraj Shanmugam, said Russians are increasingly drawn to exotic Asian holiday spots such as Phuket and Hanoi, routes already served by the SIA group.

SIA flies to 90 destinations worldwide.
