The Romanian Press Club on Monday sent Great Britain's Ambassador to Bucharest Robin Barnett an open letter, expressing "concern over the articles whereby the British public opinion is systematically manipulated and instigated against the Romanians as ethnics and nation."

"Since the British press is a model to Romanian journalists, we address you our concern that such manifestations will considerably decrease the confidence of our press in this model. Nor is the risk negligible, that the denigration and slander of Romanians might affect Great Britain's image in the eyes of the Romanian public, which we believe nobody would desire," writes the cited letter.

A series of wide circulation British dailies started in summer this year a campaign in support of the London government's decision to impose restrictions on the labor market for workers coming from Romania and Bulgaria, after the two countries join the EU on January 1, 2007, according to reports by Romanian media.

The Sun, the journal with the broadest circulation in Great Britain, and other papers, published articles rendering a negative picture of Romania and her people, depicting her as an East European country where "hundreds of thousands" of pauperized citizens are waiting for accession to rush on Great Britain's labor market, said the reports.

The press campaign continued even after the British authorities announced the restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian workers. Thus, The Sun on Friday warned that Romanian immigrants could spark a tuberculosis outbreak in Great Britain, a country where this plague was long before eradicated.

Before this article, The Sun had published last week articles about the trafficking of persons and drugs and organized crime in Romania, warning against the gangs of Romanians involved in defrauding bank machines.

The Romanian Press Club is the main professional organization of Romanian mass media.
