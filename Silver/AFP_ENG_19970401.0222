China's human rights record received a grilling Tuesday by a top US official here who told the Human Rights Commission that abuses in the country were still widespread.

US permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador William Richardson acknowledged that two decades of economic growth had dramatically improved the lives of millions of Chinese.

"However, China's government continues to commit widespread and well- documented human rights absues and to severely restrict fundamental freedoms of speech, the press, assembly, association and religion," he told the 53rd commission session.

"We do not seek confrontation over this issue, but we firmly believe that (China) should be held accountable...to the international standards that China itself has endorsed."

A Chinese delegate interrupted Richardson's address in protest, but was told he would be given a chance to respond later in the day.

An official censure of China at this year's human rights gathering appears a more remote possibility than ever before.

France last weekend announced it would not support the annual resolution condemning China's human rights record, effectively ruling out EU sponsorship of the motion.

Japan on Saturday also indicated it would not sponsor such a measure.

While resolutions have been tabled every year in Geneva since the Tiananmen pro-democracy demonstrations were quashed by the army in 1989, China has managed to pull in a majority of votes to defeat the motion.

Dissident sources and human rights groups said in Beijing Tuesday that treatment of Chinese dissidents was worsening, following a report from China's Justice Ministry on Monday proclaiming "remarkable achievements" last year in judicial guarantees of Chinese citizens' rights.

The UN representative also harshly critized Burma, Cuba, Iran and Iraq for gross human rights violations.

"Despite the efforts of legitimate democratic leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi, the despotic rulers of that poor, beleaguered land insist that their own need for power must take precedence over the rights and choices of the Burmese people."

Regarding Cuba, Richardson said "human rights are the last thing on Havana's mind at the Human Rights Commission."

Cuba was always ready to champion "exotic" rights, but was never ready to move forward on basic human rights -- freedom of speech or assembly for example, he said.

Richardson said the death sentence, or fatwa, pronounced by an Iranian foundation on British writer Salman Rushdie for a book it claims blashpemes Islam, was a "stark" demonstration of Iran's contempt for the international community's commitment to human rights.

In neighbouring Iraq, Saddam's Hussein's massive violations of international human rights law against the city of Irbil and its civilian population "are but one recent example of the kind of brutality he unleashes on his long-suffering people," Richardson said.
