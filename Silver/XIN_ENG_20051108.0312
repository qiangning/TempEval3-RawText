Middlesbrough defender Abel Xavier has again tested positive for a banned substance in the B sample of his original test, a UEFA spokesman said on Tuesday.

The spokesman said: "The B sample has confirmed the original findings."

The 32-year-old, who was tested after Boro's UEFA Cup game at Xanthi, is set to face a Uefa hearing on 17 November and could be banned for a year.

Xavier has denied any wrongdoing and said last month: "I am convinced there is a harmless explanation."

And the Portuguese star has been suspended from all competitions while an investigation takes place.

Reports have suggested the banned substance found in Xavier's test was the anabolic steroid dianabol. UEFA guidelines recommend a ban of 12 months for a first doping offence.

If Xavier is found guilty of taking a performance-enhancing drug he would be the first Premiership player to do so, although others have been found guilty of using recreational drugs.

They include former Chelsea players Adrian Mutu and Mark Bosnich, who tested positive for cocaine, and Lee Bowyer and Chris Armstrong, who tested positive for cannabis.

Current Tottenham midfielder Edgar Davids was banned for four months in 2001 for taking the steroid nandrolone when he was a Juventus player.

Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren, who signed former Everton and Liverpool defender Xavier as a short-term replacement for Michael Reiziger in the summer, is supporting the player.

"He is protesting his innocence vehemently at the moment," said McClaren, who has said Xavier is elsewhere in Europe preparing for his UEFA hearing.
