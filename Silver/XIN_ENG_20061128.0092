BANGKOK, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided to lift martial law, imposed shortly after the Sept. 19 coup, in some parts of the country, including the capital Bangkok, media reports said.

"The cabinet has approved the recommendation by the Council for National Security (CNS) to lift martial law in some parts of the country," Thai Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont was quoted by the English-laguage Bangkok Post website as saying on Tuesday after a cabinet meeting.

Surayud, however, did not specify in which provinces martial law will be removed or when the decision would take effect. Defense Minister Boonrawd Somtas would later provide the list of provinces, Surayud said.

"Martial law will be lifted in 41 provinces and remain in (the other) 35 provinces, due to both domestic and foreign security concerns, as well as concerns about drug smuggling and illegal immigration," Boonrawd later told reporters.

According to Boonrawd, martial law will remain in provinces along the borders and some areas in the interior of the country, including northern and northeastern provinces Khon Kaen, Buri Ram and Chiang Mai, which were considered the strongholds of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai Party.

Whereas martial law will be revoked in Bangkok and its suburbs, Boonrawd said the government decided to life the martial law in Bangkok for the sake of the country's image and the government was certain that it would be able to control the situation in case of protests and demonstrations.

Under pressure from international arena to lift the martial law since the coup, the military-led CNS on Monday officially sent its proposal to the interim government it installed in regard to lifting martial law in 40 provinces of the country, exclusive of Bangkok.
