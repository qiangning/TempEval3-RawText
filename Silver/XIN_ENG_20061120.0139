U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday urged 155 countries to make more efforts to intensify safeguards against biological weapons and address the threat posed by terrorists and criminal groups seeking to obtain such weapons.

"The horror of biological weapons is shared by all," Annan told a meeting in Geneva to review the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which has been ratified by 155 countries.

"Now it is time for countries to build on results, and take further steps to ensure that the Convention will continue to serve as an effective barrier against biological weapons," Annan told the conference, which began on Monday and will end on Dec. 8.

Annan said global circumstances had changed and risks had evolved since the Convention was last reviewed five years ago.

"We see today a strong focus on preventing terrorism, as well as renewed concern about naturally occurring diseases such as SARS and avian flu," he said.

Over the past five years, advances in biological science and technology continued to accelerate, promising enormous benefits for human development, but also posing potential risks, he added.

The outgoing UN chief highlighted terrorism and crime and urged countries to address these threats "to ensure that peaceful uses of biological science and technology can safely reach their potential."

The Convention, which bans the development, use and stockpiling of germ-based weapons, has never been seriously enforced because the threat of biological warfare was seen as minimal when it was drafted at the height of the Cold War.

Efforts to strengthen the treaty have been largely fruitless due to divisions among countries.
