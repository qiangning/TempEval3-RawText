A three-day symposium on Respecting and Promoting Human Rights and Constructing a Harmonious World ended on Friday with a wide-ranging consensus for more cooperation to develop human rights.

More than 70 delegates from 19 countries submitted papers and delivered speeches covering almost every aspect of human rights, including basic concepts, national practices, individual freedoms, rights of different social groups, political rights and rights relevant to daily life.

"The symposium set an example for exchanges and dialogue as delegates from different countries and cultures shared views with mutual respect," said Jin Jian, vice-director of the China Society for Human Rights Studies.

Jin said delegates to the Beijing event clarified standpoints of their respective countries. They all expressed the wish to safeguard and promote human rights by all countries and peoples.

Delegates from China proposed the principle that the universal character of human rights must be implemented proceeding from the specific conditions of each country. The right to subsistence and development was the human right of paramount importance. All countries should promote dialogue and oppose antagonism.

All delegates believed all people were entitled to human rights, irrespective of race, gender, religious belief and language. The elimination of poverty, and economic and social development were of special importance to the development of human rights.

Jin said some countries promoted rights through their constitutions, some protected rights with the help of non-governmental organizations, and some promoted political democracy through eliminating illiteracy.

Delegates hoped the United Nations Commission of Human Rights played a positive role in promoting international cooperation.

Jin said the concept of a harmonious world was worthy of the joint efforts of all humanity. Insufficient respect and guarantees for human rights led to wars, increasing poverty, the widening of south-north disparities, terrorism, environmental degradation and other problems.

Dong Yunhu, vice-director and general-secretary of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, said controversies were left unresolved after the meeting, and exchanges of different views would continue.

"We all hoped that nations could strengthen international cooperation on both governmental and non-governmental levels," he said.
