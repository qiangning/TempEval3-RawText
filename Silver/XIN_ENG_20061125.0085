Visiting exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal warned Saturday that the Palestinian authorities could collapse and there would be a third intifada (uprising) if the international community couldn't find a political vision to a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders within six months.

Meshaal, who arrived here on an unannounced visit on Wednesday night, made the remarks at a press conference broadcast live on the Doha-based al-Jazeera Arabic channel.

The international community has six months to work out a real political solution for a Palestinian state, and such a state should be based on the 1967 borders, said Meshaal, now exiled in the Syrian capital Damascus.

There is a historic opportunity for such a political solution, but if the demands are not met, the Palestinians will seal off all political files and start a third intifada, he warned.

Meshaal also warned that there would be more Palestinian resistance groups like Hamas, which is bent on Israel's destruction, without such political vision to a Palestinian state within six months.

The first intifada witnessed a series of violent incidents between the Palestinians and Israel between 1987 and 1990.

The second intifada, or called the al-Aqsa intifada, is the wave of violence that began in September 2000. The second intifada never ended officially, but the relative success of the Sharm el- Sheikh Summit and the low levels of violence during 2005, were considered by many to mark its effective end.

The Sharm el-Sheikh Summit occurred in February 2005 when four leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories met in Egypt's Red Sea resort in order to declare their wish to work towards the end of the four-year intifada.

The four leaders were Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King Abdullah II, then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
