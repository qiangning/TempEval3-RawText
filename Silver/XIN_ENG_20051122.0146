Although a channel to flow fund from overseas for terrorist cell in Indonesia has been cut, the Indonesian police would persistently track down the other possible ways to flow funds for the cell here, in a bid to totally stop the channeling of finance to the cell in the world most populated Muslim country, Police chief General Sutanto said here on Tuesday.

Sutanto said that the police would hunt and capture curriers of funds as well as cooperate with banking sectors to freeze the money.

He said that terrorist cell in overseas had sent money to terrorist cells here to finance explosions.

"We hope to continuously able to stop the flow of their funds. We will capture their curriers and cooperate with banks," he said.

To prevent from the authority's surveilance, the terrorists in overseas had ignored to send their funds through bank, but currier, Sutanto said.

"After sending fund with currier, terrorist changes the currier with other person for the other sending," he said.

Sutanto claimed that currently the terrorist cells in the country were facing financial problem, as they had raised funds through selling of mobile phone vouchers and robbing gold store.

A key terrorist suspect Imam Samudra and other terrorist fellows robbed a gold store in West java province to finance Bali bombings in 2002.

Abdullah Sonanta, who channeled fund from a terrorist cell in Saudi Arabia, was captured in June last year, his arrest has disrupted the funding from the cell, said Sutanto.
