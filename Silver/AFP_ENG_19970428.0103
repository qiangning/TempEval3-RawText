More than 70 people have been arrested and a number of guns found by the Rwandan security forces in the Ruhengeri region of northern Rwanda, Radio Rwanda said.

Thirty-seven people were arrested in the district of Ndusu, where two guns and 10 grenades were found, the radio said late Sunday. It did not say when the arrests took place.

Thirty-nine people were arrested in the neighbouring district of Nyamureta, where security forces found four guns, the radio said. It said that the local population had assisted the security forces.

The security forces appeared to be treating the men as members of the former Rwandan Hutu, or Interhamwe, and former Rwandan army (FAR).

Accused of taking part in the worst massacres in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which killed at least 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, the former militia and army soldiers are believed by authorities to be carrying out attacks in northern and western Rwanda.

A large number of former militia members and ex-FAR soldiers returned to Rwanda at the end of last year from Zaire, among hundreds of thousands of returning refugees.
