Italy's unemployment rate fell to 6.8 percent of the workforce in the third quarter, its lowest reading since 1992, from 6.9 percent in the second, the statistics agency Istat said Wednesday.

The number of people holding jobs increased 2.0 percent to 23 million from third quarter 2005.

The increase reflected employment gains by foreign residents and people over 50 as well as short-term contracts given to workers under the age of 40, according to the agency.
