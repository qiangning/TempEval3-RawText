China's famous Shaolin Temple is planning to cull outstanding Kungfu players worldwide via television, internet and mobile phones in a bid to better promote its 1,500-year martial art heritage and fame.

"Our efforts will reach more people and be more effective by using modern technologies and media channels," said Shi Yongxin, abbot with the temple, at a press conference here Thursday.

The 8-month grand competition, to be shown on television across China through satellite transmission as of March next year, will allow Chinese audiences to vote for their favorite Kungfu exercisers through the website or mobile phone messages.

The top 108 winners are expected to have the chance to play a part in a movie and TV series depicting martial arts and monks of Shaolin, according to Fu Min, general manager with the Shaolin Temple Culture Communication Co., Ltd, which is owned by the temple.

"We hope more people around the world will enjoy, practice and benefit from Chinese Kungfu," said Shi.

The movie and TV series, both named "Legends of Monk Warriors from Shaolin Temple," will be based on a true story of the temple and is expected to attract top international actors and film industry professionals to work on the production, with an estimated cost of 200 million yuan (nearly 25 million US dollars).

Shaolin monks have made world tours in recently years to perform martial arts, attracting over 30,000 fervent fans and attention from local media, according to Shi.

The senior abbot, who has visited some 30 countries, said he always uses mobile phones, digital cameras, portable computers and e-mails.

"Modern technologies facilitate my communication with the world and help me to better manage the temple," said Shi.

The temple, which has been running its own website for years, is planning to open another one in English to promote its cooperation with the world.

Established about 1,500 years ago in central China's Henan Province, Shaolin is famed for the great combination of martial arts style and Chan, a sect of Buddhism, that features long meditation sessions for purifying the mind.

Shaolin Kungfu is an important component part of the Chinese culture and has played a key role in the development of Chinese civilization.

"Instead of fading gradually in the high-tech era, the Chinese martial arts have created a peculiar platform in the modern world, " said Fu.

The establishment of the cultural communication company is to scientifically research and develop the temple's cultural heritages and promote its fame in the world, according to the manager.

Fu, also a monk of Shaolin, used to study in the United States for media communication and speaks good English.

"With the help of technologies and modern media, the ancient temple will face a more vigorous development era," said Shi.
