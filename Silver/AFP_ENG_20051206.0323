US stocks opened higher Tuesday as year-end rally sentiment returned after a pullback in crude oil futures.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 35.54 points (0.33 percent) to 10,870.55 and the Nasdaq composite pushed higher by 11.69 points (0.52 percent) to 2,269.33 in the first exchanges.

On Monday, the main indexes ended lower, hurt by a rise in oil prices and a jump in long-term interest rates. However, the stock market in general has been rallying during the last five weeks, benefiting from data pointing to economic strength and oversold conditions.

The positive trend was in force once again at Tuesday's opening.

Steve Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden and Co., said, "There was some skittishness yesterday about oil and bond prices. But that has dissipated a bit. We still have seasonal factors in the back of every trader's mind."

Bob Dickey at RBC Dain Rauscher said the market has held at key levels despite profit taking in recent sessions, suggesting the rally remains intact.

"Any further dips in the market over the next few days are regarded by us as being great buy points for the continuation of the year-end rally," he said.
