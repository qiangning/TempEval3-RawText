With talk of a financial crisis burdening them German club Hertha Berlin could do without any more bad news, but they got it this weekend with a player dispute.

Croat defender Niko Kovac and Brazilian midfielder Marcelinho -- two of the club's leading players -- tore into one another after Saturday's 2-1 defeat at SV Hamburg in which Marcelinho was red-carded.

With just eight minutes gone Hamburg stormed into a two-goal lead through a Dick van Burik own goal and a Mehdi Mahdivikia penalty while Berlin's Brazilian playmaker Marcelinho was booked for complaining.

Marcelinho was then sent off after 52 minutes for a scuffle with Hamburg's Benjamin Lauth and Croatian international Kovac could not contain his rage.

"His lack of discipline can not be excused," fumed Kovac. "He gave the team too much to do. He just complained and that is not on because we could have got something from this match with 11 men."

Hertha manager Falko Gotz admitted he would speak with Marcelinho about his conduct but the Brazilian star hit back at the criticism from Kovac.

"When I have a good game and we win because of me I do not hear a thing from Niko," Marcelinho. "He needs to chill out. I do not need to apologise when I have an off-day."

The 30-year-old Marcelinho, contracted at Hertha until June 2007, was voted German Player of the Year last season after scoring 18 goals from midfield and the media dubbed Hertha 'FC Marcelinho'.

But while his talent is not in doubt his Latin temper can often irk team-mates and last season he had a similar verbal exhange of words with club captain Arne Friedrich.

Marcelinho later apologised for the incident but said he would not accept a punishment from the club this time around.

"I would not accept a fine because I am not an undisciplined player and have only been sent off twice for Hertha," Marcelinho said.

Hertha stay fifth despite the defeat in Hamburg but are ten points points adrift of Werder Bremen who occupy the third and final Champions League spot.

With debts estimated at 35.6 million euros (42 million dollars) Hertha could do with the financial windfall that accompanies the Champions League but it looks like they need to repair team spirit first.
