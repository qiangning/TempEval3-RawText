Nepal is seeking Indian help to resolve the problem of Bhutanese refugees languishing in eastern Nepal for more than a decade, officials said Tuesday.

A seven-member team led by Bhutanese refugee leader Tek Nath Rijal met with Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala on Monday to press their demands to be repatriated.

"The prime minister said that he has been in regular touch with India and is seeking Indian government's help to resolve the refugee crisis," Balram Poudel, the chairman of the exiled Bhutan People's Party, told AFP.

But he quoted the prime minister as saying that New Delhi continues to view the crisis as a "bilateral issue between Nepal and Bhutan".

More than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, mostly ethnic Nepalese Hindus, have been living in seven camps in southeast Nepal after leaving Bhutan in 1990 when the Buddhist kingdom launched cultural reforms encouraging the use of Bhutan's language and national dress.

Bhutan later expelled more ethnic Nepalese for allegedly entering the remote Himalayan kingdom illegally. Bhutan and Nepal have argued for years over each other's responsibility for the refugees.

In October, the United States said it was prepared to absorb 60,000 Bhutanese refugees, while Australia and Canada have also said they are willing to grant asylum.

Fresh rounds of talks between Nepal and Bhutan had been scheduled for November this year, but the talks were put off due to the Nepalese government's preoccupation with a peace deal with Maoist insurgents.

Fifteen rounds of bilateral talks between the two Himalayan kingdoms have already been held to address the refugee problem but failed to yield any concrete results.
