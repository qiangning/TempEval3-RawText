International football's governing body is to launch a full investigation into clashes between Turkish and Swiss players following their play off qualifying match for next year's World Cup final, Turkish private NTV reported on Thursday.

The report said that should it be found at fault, Turkey could be banned from taking part in the 2010 World Cup.

The physical match, which saw Turkey win the game but lose out on a place in the finals in Germany on away goals, was followed by a brawl involving a number of players and officials from both sides on Wednesday.

Switzerland's Stephane Grichting was hospitalized after the mayhem, reportedly after being kicked in the groin and Swiss coach Kobi Kuhn was also hit by coins thrown by the crowd as he left the pitch after the match.

In announcing the investigation, FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Thursday condemned the incidents, saying he had been horrified by the events following the game.

"Something is going wrong in football," he said, adding, "I've never seen anything like it."

Blatter vowed that if sanctions were found to be warranted, they would be applied in full.

"I can tell you this, not as a Swiss, but as the president of FIFA that we will act here and we will act tough," he said.

FIFA has it in its power to ban any country's football association from taking part in competitions or events, up to and including a ban on taking part in the 2010 world Cup.
