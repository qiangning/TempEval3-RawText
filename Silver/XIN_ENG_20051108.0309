England assistant coach Tord Grip has hinted Sven-Goran Eriksson will stay as head coach after next summer's World Cup finals.

The England boss has a contract until 2008 but many believe he will quit the job immediately after Germany 2006.

However Grip was quoted by BBC Radio Five Live as saying that Eriksson is in no rush to leave and added: "I can see him staying.

"I think so because he likes his job, that's for sure. For me, it would be absolutely perfect, I love my job."

Grip's also revealed that he expects John Terry to be the England skipper one day, although Beckham will almost certainly retain the captain's armband next summer.

"I see him as a very good player, very good defender, and he's a very good captain for Chelsea, so why shouldn't he be captain of the England team?" added the Swede.

"He is the captain in Chelsea and Rio (Ferdinand) is sometimes the captain at Manchester United, so we just have David Beckham for us and he will be the captain in the World Cup, that's for sure."

Eriksson has guided England to three successive major tournaments but has received criticism for not showing emotion on the sidelines during games.

Commenting on the manager's approach in the dressing room, Grip said: "He is not screaming. He is just calm and telling people what to do, it's not necessary to scream and shout."

Last week Eriksson insisted there is no get-out clause in his England contract as he declared he had never considered leaving his post after the finals in Germany.

Asked about the existence of any clause in his current deal, he said: "Absolutely not. My contract runs until 2008. It's not true."
