Moody's Investors Service Friday lowered the long-term debt ratings of three major Thai banks and called for tougher regulation amid concerns over deteriorating asset quality.

The New York-based ratings agency said in a statement announcing the downgrades that more rigorous requirements and enforcements were needed "to restore confidence in the regulation and supervision of Thai banks."

Bank of Ayudhya had its long-term senior debt and deposit ratings lowered from Baa1 to Baa2, while Thai Military Bank and Siam City Bank were downgraded from Baa2 to Baa3.

Moody's said the action reflected the "anticipated impact that Thailand's weakening financial fundamentals, declining property and stock markets, deepening crisis in the finance company sector and continuing economic slowdown will have on the three banks' asset quality, capital levels and profitability."

It follows Moody's downgrading of Thailand's long term sovereign debt rating from A2 to A3 two weeks ago.

Thai regulators had moved in "the right direction" to encourage mergers and more stringent disclosure and provisioning requirements in the troubled financial company sector, Moody's said.

But the transparency of Thai financial statements was "generally poor."

"Thai banks are allowed a great deal of regulatory forbearance in such items as the need to create loan loss reserves and regarding non- accrual of loans," the statement said.

The central Bank of Thailand had disclosed that the level of non- performing loans at Thai banks was 7.7 percent in June 1996 but individual banks do not currently disclose this information, Moody's said.

However the central bank had announced that information disclosure on asset quality would be necessary with financial statements from June 30, it added.

Unofficial estimates have put the level of bad debt in the financial system at more than 700 billion baht (27 billion dollars).

Friday's downgradings had been widely expected following an announcement from Moody's in March that it was reviewing the three banks' ratings and the decision was largely discounted in trading on the bourse, which closed down 0.6 percent, analysts said.

Moody's also lowered the short-term ratings of Bank of Aduyhya and Thai Military Bank from Prime-2 to Prime-3, while confirming Siam City's Prime-3 rating. The financial strength ratings and subordinated debt of all three banks were lowered.

The agency said it expected the levels of non-performing assets for the three banks to rise by another 50-to-100 percent over levels at the end of 1996 levels.

The impact on banks of problems in the property sector would be likely to continue for several years, due to oversupply and the effect of high domestic interest rates used by the central bank to defend the baht, the statement said.

The banks would also suffer a "contingent liability" for the troubled finance company sector suffering funding and capital deficiencies.

On the positive side, Moody's pointed to the good lending margins of Thai banks -- with a system wide average of more than 3.5 percent -- and a supportive regulatory environment.

"These factors will help the banks generate the core profits to absorb the potential losses which may materialize as well as maintain confidence in the banking sector," Moody's said.

Also, Thailand still enjoys strong underlying fundamentals and a robust rate of economic growth, it said.

A dealer with Adkinson Securities said the Moody's action had not compounded the underlying weakness in the stock market.

"The market is struggling more on the expectation of broadly weaker first quarter earnings and news that the economy was still performing badly," he said.
