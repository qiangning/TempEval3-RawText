The European Parliament has overwhelmingly approved the introduction of a European Union (EU)-wide blacklist of unsafe airlines, in a package of measures to bolster air safety on the continent.

Under the proposed regulation, airlines, whether they are based in the EU or not, which fail to meet certain safety requirements will be subject to an operating ban throughout the EU, the parliament said in a press release.

Passengers will be informed of the blacklist and will have the right to compensation should the carrier they have made reservation with be included in the blacklist, it said.

The EU deputies voted by 577 in favor and 16 against the measures, which also include proposals to boost EU aviation authorities powers in areas such as licensing pilots.

The blacklist will be drawn up by the EU's executive body the European Commission after consulting member states and air carriers concerned will have the opportunity of being heard. The list will be published on the Internet and in the EU's official journal.

At least every three months, the commission should verify whether it is appropriate to update the list, either adding or removing air carriers from it.

EU transport commissioner Jacques Barrot said Tuesday that such a blacklist could be in place by as early as January 2006, as there is already broad agreement between the commission, the European Parliament and national authorities on this issue.

Transport ministers of EU member countries are expected to adopt the regulation on December 5 and the list could be made public early in the new year.

Currently there is a patchwork of rules on suspect airlines in Europe. France and Belgium have this year introduced blacklists of banned airlines, following Britain and Switzerland which already have such lists.

The incoherence of current rules was highlighted in May when a Turkish airline, suspended by four European countries, simply redirected its flights to Belgium which had no ban.

A European Commission spokesman responsible for transport said Wednesday airlines blacklisted have the right to appeal the decision by the EU executive.
