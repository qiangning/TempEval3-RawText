International pressure grew on Thursday on Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to leave power and avoid more bloodshed as the ailing dictator's former allies deserted him.

With rebels gaining more territory each day and political chaos deepening in Kinshasa, US officials said the Mobutu era is over while French diplomats maintained an embarrassed silence after at one time maintaining that Mobutu could not be excluded from efforts to end the civil war in Africa's third largest country.

But former French development aid minister Michel Roussin said that Mobutu was "a dinosaur... who must go, I think he is actually on the point of departure."

In Washington, White House spokesman Michael McCurry said "We have suggested that the era of Mobutuism in Zaire is over, because the status quo is no longer tenable, given the dire conditions that exist for the people of Zaire."

"It's clear we have to move beyond Mr. Mobutu," he said, calling him "a creature of history."

Mobutu, 66, who is seriously ill with prostate cancer, has lost control of large sections of Zaire to rebels led by Laurent Kabila. The country's second largest city, Lubumbashi, fell Wednesday.

State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns also said Mobutu's rule in Zaire was essentially over.

"We have not asked him to resign or asked anybody else to ask him to resign, but we think the time of Mobutuism is over" Burns said, adding "It is time for the dictatorship to end."

George Moose, assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, set the tone for the US administration on Tuesday when he told Congress: "Mobutu, his regime is a thing of the past."

It was the first time that a US official has publicly acknowledged that Mobutu, a key US ally since the 1960s, had lost Washington's support.

Nonetheless, Moose did leave open the possibility that Mobutu might remain president -- or at least stay in a position of power -- by saying that he could exert a positive influence during a peaceful transition period.

The United States has been distancing itself from the Mobutu regime, once one of its closest allies in Africa, for several years. In 1994, it cut off all economic and military aid.

Meanwhile South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said Thursday that "despotic rule" in Zaire was "no longer possible," suggesting that President Mobutu Sese Seko stand down.

"Everybody is committed to the fact that there must be a fundamental change in Zaire and that despotic rule is no longer possible," Pahad said in a radio interview.

Pahad co-chaired peace talks that ended in South Africa Tuesday between Zairean rebels and the government.

In Paris, foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt, asked if France still supported Mobutu, declared "We do not support anyone.It is not a case of personality for us. We support Zaire and the future of its people, Zaire as an independent and sovereign state."

Asked if he considered the Kinshasa regime legitimate, Rummelhardt said France "does not recognise governments, but recognises states."

Roussin, a former member of the French secret service, expressed regrets that France "does not get on" with rebel leader Kabila and "has no contacts with him."

Roussin expressed doubts on the credibility of Kabila's rebel movement, hinting that it was supported by foreign powers.

"I would very much like Mr. Kabila... if he wants to be a democrat as he said in November 1966, to sit down at a (negotiating) table as often happens in Africa."

The former minister said he hoped Kabila would take part in a "national conference to prepare a transition and that the fighting be stopped and that negotiations be staged to culminate of course in elections."

Roussin said it was obvious that Kabila's army had not sprung out of nothing. Kabila "is being pushed and obviously he has very powerful allies," Roussin said.

The ex-minister also criticised the French military presence in Africa saying it dated from "the strategic situation of another age." He said that France was perhaps "losing influence" and that the "English- speaking world is gaining ground."

Former French defence minister Francois Leotard, chief of the Union for French Democracy, junior partner in the ruling conservative coalition, recently strongly condemned French African policy and regretted that Paris "has given the impression of supporting to the end a widely discredited regime."

Leotard denounced France's "triple failure, tactical, moral and geopolitical" in Zaire and said his country "lacks a true African policy."
