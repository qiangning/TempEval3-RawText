Authorities in Madagascar have arrested an opposition leader suspected of involvement in an extortion racket, police said Thursday amid claims the detention is political.

Jean-Eugene Voninahitsy, the leader of the Indian Ocean island's Rally for Social Democracy (RSPD) party and a member of parliament, was arrested after being accused of receiving bribes from a motor vehicle importer, police said.

He was detained Wednesday when police said they caught him and a customs official taking cash from the car dealer as part of a scam to defraud the state of import duties.

"This MP was arrested in flagrante delicto extorting money in a bribery deal involving the customs service," police spokesman Justin Ratsimbazafarison told AFP.

He said Voninahitsy was found with the equivalent of 960 dollars (800 euros) in cash allegedly taken from the car dealer.

"This was just part of the money he was demanding," the spokesman said.

The RSPD said Voninahitsy's arrest was the result of politically motivated entrapment and aimed at scuppering a weekend rally planned by opposition groups on the island.

"This is a political move to try and stop Saturday's meeting," said Jose Rakotomavo, a party official. "We think they wanted to set him up, this is too obvious."
