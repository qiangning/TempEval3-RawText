The United States will provide 15 million dollars in emergency aid to North Korea to help feed young children in the famished communist country, the State Department said Tuesday.

The new aid -- 50,000 tonnes of US corn to be given through the UN World Food Programme (WFP) -- is targeted at nursery school- and kindergarten-aged children, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

"I think we're talking about food arriving as quickly as a couple of months," he said, adding that the first two ships bearing 10 million dollars in US food aid pledged in February would arrive in the first two weeks of May.

The aid, valued at about 15 million dollars and announced after a series of high-level US visits to East Asia, brings total US emergency assistance to North Korea to 33.4 million dollars since 1995, when flooding damaged Pyongyang's already low food supplies.

One US official, who asked not to be named, said the US pledge was sharply lower than the amount of aid Pyongyang requested.

No reaction was immediately available from the WFP.

"There are roughly 2.4 million children under the age of six who we believe are adversely affected" by the food shortage, Burns said. "We think the food situation will reach a critical stage this spring with children severely at risk."

On April 7, the United Nations launched an urgent appeal for 126 million dollars to help North Korea, citing a sharp deterioration in recent months. The WFP estimates North Korea's grain shortfall for 1997 at 1.8 million to 2.3 metric tonnes.

Burns denied any link between the emergency aid and North Korea's expected announcement this week that it will take part in four-party talks aimed at reaching a permanent peace treaty between the two Koreas.

"We view the issue of food for children as a humanitarian issue only," Burns said.

Analysts here regard the aid nonetheless as part of a package deal aimed at baiting the heavily armed, tightly closed country out of its international isolation.

Senior diplomats from North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were to meet Wednesday in New York to hear Pyongyang's answer to a year-old US and South Korean proposal for the four-way peace talks.

The four-way talks, with China and the United States acting as intermediaries, are aimed at hammering out a peace agreement to replace the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War.

Seeking to address a longstanding US concern, North Korea has also just agreed to meet US official in New York from May 12-13 for a new round of talks aimed at curbing Pyongyang's suspected missile exports.

US officials have long expressed concern about suspected North Korean missile exports to the Middle East and pressed Pyongyang to continue discussions on the issue begun a year ago in Berlin.

Some 37,000 American troops are still stationed in South Korea, locked in a tense and bitter truce with the North since the shooting war between them ended 44 years ago.
