China's approach to its fight against the bird flu is "resolute and comprehensive", said Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister of Health and Solidarity, Tuesday during his two-day visit to Shanghai.

"The Chinese government has a very full, clear understanding on the importance of containing the pandemic and the general public here have not shown an unnecessary sign of panic," Bertrand said.

He said both Chinese and French governments have taken prudent measures in preventing bird flu, adding that China has made great efforts to share information with the rest of the world.

Bertrand was invited by the Chinese Ministry of Health to kick off his first official visit to China on Nov 21. During the two-day visit, he discussed a range of issues on the topic of bird flu prevention and control with his Chinese counterpart Gao Qiang.

"China and France have a long history of cooperation in the medical field and the two sides will continue to promote medical exchanges in the future," Bertrand said.
