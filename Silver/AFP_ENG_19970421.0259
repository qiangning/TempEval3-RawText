The normally bustling streets of Monday morning London ground to a virtual standstill as a series of IRA pre-election bomb alerts turned downtown briefly into a ghost town.

An eerie silence fell over the city centre.

Usually packed Trafalgar Square was empty but for its thousands of pigeons.

Stranded office workers waited patiently behind security barriers after bomb scares stopped them from cutting across the central tourist magnet to get to work.

"It's one of the hazards of living in London really, isn't it?" said 29-year-old bank manager Justin Hare. "I'm quite immune to it."

The scene was repeated across London after police sealed off streets around six of the core area's key rail and underground stations.

Michael Foot, 83-year-old former Labour leader, was among the thousands delayed at Paddington station, and made his frustration clear.

"The Irish republicans have a good cause, but this sort of thing brings it into disrepute," he said.

Postal worker John Kehoe was furious.

"I was born in London but both my parents were born in Ireland," he said. "They are both dead now but they detested what the IRA are doing. It gives hard-working Irish people in Britain a bad name."

Anne Sparrow, a public relations officer stuck outside King's Cross station, said: "I guess it will get worse before the (May 1) election. I don't think the people behind this are going to get public opinion on their side -- they certainly won't get mine."

Meanwhile at Gatwick Airport south of the city -- one of the four London airports hit -- staff were scampering to find a vacant hangar to shelter some 8,000 disembarking passengers suddenly without means to get back to London.

Gatwick duty manager Mike Cook said many passengers were trapped on the tarmac, unable to leave the dozens of planes which had landed since the terminals were closed for bomb searches at around 06h30 GMT.

Some flights were still landing, others were being diverted but no flights were taking off, said Cook.

Police were warning against unnecessary travel and advising walking or cycling where possible.

"Basically, west London and central London are closed," said Royal Automobile Club spokesman Peter Brill.

"This is some of the worst traffic chaos that we have seen in London for many years, if ever."
