A Mozambican man suspect of murdering Jorge Microsse, director of Maputo central prison, has escaped from the city's police headquarters, local media reported on Tuesday.

The suspect, known by the nickname "Todinho", escaped before dawn Monday along with four other inmates.

Although the police have so far refused to confirm or deny Todinho's escape, an official Interior Ministry statement confirmed that five people had escaped from the police cells of the Maputo city command, in the small hours of Monday morning.

Eight policemen, including sergeants and officers, have been detained, accused of negligence in allowing the escape to happen.

Todinho had been waiting trial for the Oct. 21 murder of Microsse, who shortly before his death said he was the target of death threats because of his pledge to crackdown on corruption in the prison system.
