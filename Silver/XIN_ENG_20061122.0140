German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday condemned the murder of Lebanese Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel, saying it was "a cowardly act.

"We want to see an independent Lebanon and forceful efforts to end violence," she told the German Bundestag parliament.

The German Chancellor extended her condolences in a telephone call to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora on Tuesday, pledging to continue support for the reconstruction of the Middle East country.

Gemayel, a member of the anti-Syrian faction in the Lebanese government, was shot dead on Tuesday by a gunshot to the head when his convoy was attacked on a street in Jedeide, about 15 km northeast of Beirut.
