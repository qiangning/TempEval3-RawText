North Korea's uncrowned leader Kim Jong-Il on Friday reviewed a massive military parade in Pyongyang to mark the twin anniversaries of army day and the late leader Kim Il-Sung's birthday.

North Korea's mouthpiece Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the son and heir of Kim Il-Sung reviewed the marchpast from a platform.

"When Supreme Commander of the KPA (Korean People's Army) comrade Kim Jong-Il appeared on the platform a storm of cheers burst forth," KCNA said.

Also present in his first public appearance in some 16 months was Kang Song-San, 66, believed to have been sacked as North Korea's prime minister.

KCNA in its Korean-language service, did not specify Kang's title, however, making it impossible to confirm whether he remained prime minister, the Jiji Press and Kyodo News agencies said.

The KCNA's English service did not mention Kang's name.

Kang, who reportedly suffers from diabets and other health problems, became premier in the diehard Stalinist state in 1992, but was widely believed to have been dismissed as premier when North Korea's official media referred to Hong Song-Nam as acting premier in late February.

Kang's name was absent from a list of members commissioned to prepare for the funeral of the then armed forces minister, Choe Kwang, who died in February.

The Korean-language KCNA report said that sharing the reviewing platform with the junior Kim at the parade were Vice Presidents Ri Jong-Ok, Pak Song-Chol and Kim Yong-Ju as well as Kang and Kim Pyong- Sik, another vice president.

It also said they were accompanied by such military officers as Li Ul- Sol, chief of the secret service, and Cho Myong-Rok, head of the general political bureau of the People's Army, the Jiji and Kyodo agencies said.

Columns of guard units, military academies, worker-peasant red guards and young red guards took part in the march, after Kim Jong-Il had taken a salute from Kim Yong-Chun, chief of the general staff of the KPA, and waved to the parade participants, it said.

Friday is marked in North Korea as the official 65th anniversary of the people's army, which traces its birth to the fight against Japanese occupation before the two Koreas were divided after Japan's defeat in World War II.

Kim Il-Sung, the country's sole leader until he died in 1994, would have been 85 on April 15 .

KCNA said Kim Il-Sung's portrait, escorted by the colors of the three services, preceded the flag of the "Supreme Commander of the armed forces," the only top official post held by his son.

The country's presidency, and the key post of Workers' (Communist) party general secretary, have remained vacant since the elder Kim's death.

KCNA said that the junior Kim went on one of his trademark field trips to a KPA unit on Thursday to congratulate it on the anniversary.

"He noted with great satisfaction that the soldiers (of Unit 969) have grown into invincible combatants able to smash any enemy in one stroke, as taught by the president during his personal visits," it said.

Other mass events marking the twin anniversaries were listed by KCNA as the laying of wreaths at the giant statue of Kim Il-Sung in Pyongyang and at the Mount Taesong martyrs cemetery and the unveiling of busts of Korean War heroes.

No mention was made by the agency of the drastic food shortages facing North Korea which have forced it to call on the international community for the third straight year for massive food aid.
