The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) will participate in two major international events this month as part of its continuous efforts to market the country as a prime tourist destination and revive the fortunes of the flagging tourism sector, an official said on Saturday.

ZTA marketing and communications director, Givemore Chidzidzi said they would be participating at the World Travel Market (WTM) in London from November 14 to 17 and at the China International Travel Market (CITM) in southwestern city Kunming from 24 to 27 of this month.

"We have at least 15 companies that will participate on the Zimbabwean stand at the WTM and we will also be seeking to consolidate our presence at the mega show in China," Chidzidzi said.

He said Zimbabwe would have to be more aggressive and tactful in its marketing campaign in China in the wake of more competitors coming on stream from Europe, which has been recently granted an Approved Destinations Status (ADS) by the Asian country.

"We have to be more aggressive now because tourists from China are simply not going to come because we have the ADS," he said.

Zimbabwe was granted the ADS by China in 2003 to become one of the eight African countries that the Chinese government approves for its citizens to travel to.

Meanwhile, Chidzidzi said the delegation to Kunming would travel to Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai after the CITM to conduct sales calls with their Chinese counterparts.

Last year the delegates held a workshop in Shanghai during which they met and discussed business with Chinese tour operators.

Chidzidzi said they would also take the opportunity presented by the CITM to make a follow up on the 31 Chinese buyers who participated at the 2005 Zimbabwe Travel Expo held in Harare last month.
