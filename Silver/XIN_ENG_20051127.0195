Yakubu scored a second-half penalty to earn Middlesbrough a 2-2 draw with visiting West Brom in the English Premier League on Sunday.

The Nigerian converted his spot-kick after Paul Robinson was adjudged to have fouled substitute Szilard Nemeth.

Middlesbrough took the lead when Mark Viduka's effort with the outside of his boot left keeper Tomasz Kuszczak stranded.

West Brom equalized through Nathan Ellington's rifled shot and then led 2-1 when Nwankwo Kanu fired home from Robinson's pass.

The final result was a fair one after both sides created ample chances and provided great entertainment on a rain-drenched day in Middlesbrough.

The first half-chance fell to the home side and resulted in a goal.

Viduka, who has often been criticized for not putting in enough effort during matches, proved what a valuable asset he is to Steve McClaren's squad, with a goal that would have scored 10s for artistic merit.

"Kanu is my vote for man of the match - he was fantastic."

Former Boro boss Bryan Robson knows the importance of having a player with Viduka's guile and ingenuity in the squad.

In Kanu, he has that, although the Nigerian's strike rate is far lower than that of his Middlesbrough counterpart.

But Robson has kept faith with the former Arsenal striker throughout the season for that little bit extra he gives the team.

His selection of Kanu for Sunday's match paid dividends six minutes after Viduka's strike.

First, the Nigerian directed Quedrue's failed clearance into the path of Ellington, who punished the Frenchman's mistake.

And shortly after the break, he gave the visitors the lead, picking up Robinson's square ball, selling Middlesbrough's defenders a dummy before passing the ball past keeper Mark Schwarzer.

Robinson, who had come back into the first team following a three-match suspension, also had a hand in the next goal - although it went to Middlesbrough.

As the cross from Boro midfielder Fabio Rochemback came in, Robinson climbed over Nemeth, which resulted in referee Peter Walton pointing to the spot.

Yakubu converted to silence the vocal Baggies travelers.

The Nigeria striker should have given Boro the win, but failed to round keeper Kuszczak, while Jonathan Greening went close with a low effort that shaved Schwarzer's left-hand post late in the game.
