US boxing legend Muhammed Ali arrived in Berlin on Friday to receive a major German peace prize for his efforts to promote civil rights and the work of the United Nations.

The former world heavyweight champion will on Saturday accept the Otto Hahn peace medal, named for a German nuclear physicist, the German Society for the United Nations said.

Ali has been selected "for his lifelong engagement in the American civil rights movement and the global cultural emancipation of blacks as well as his work as a UN Goodwill ambassador," Christine Kalb, the regional president of the society, told a press conference.

The 63-year-old Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, attended the conference but left it to his wife Lonnie to speak to journalists.

"Boxing allowed him to travel the world. Even then he was already an ambassador for peace," she said, adding that her husband was doing well.

The prize is awarded every two years. Previous winners include former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.

Otto Hahn (1879-1968) won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1944 and after the war became a vocal nuclear arms control advocate.

After receiving the prize, Ali was due to attend a boxing match in Berlin pitting his daughter, unbeaten boxer Laila Ali, against Sweden's Asa Maria Sandell.

"He is very proud of his daughter, even though as a Muslim and a man, he has reservations about female boxing," his wife said.

"He will be happy if Laila claims her 22nd victory," she added.
