Edgar Bronfman, the billionaire chairman of Seagram Inc., has been issued a summons to face an Orthodox Jewish court and accused of "misrepresenting" Jewish efforts to recover assets from Swiss banks, Jewish officials said.

A Hasidic group, the World Council of Orthodox Jewish Communities, issued a rabbinical court summons Tuesday for the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), which Bronfman chairs, according to the president of the World Council, Rabbi Chaim Stauber.

In the summons, known as a "beit din," World Council members accuse Bronfman of "misrepresenting" the Jewish community and demand that he cease all current negotiations until their grievances are resolved.

"We are dealing with the spoils of the war, the ashes of our forefathers," Stauber said.

"This is an uphill battle. It's like fighting Goliath."

The WJRO -- a worldwide consortium of nine organizations -- is the group negotiating restitution issues with Switzerland, Poland and other European countries to regain property stolen from Jews during World War II.

But the World Council, whose members are mainly comprised of survivors of pre-war European Jewry, complain that they have been unable to get their restitution claims addressed.

The World Council is comprised of strictly Orthodox Hasidic Jews. They are forbidden from suing other Jews in a state court, and must instead seek to have their grievances addressed by a triumvirate of rabbis in a beit din.

If the WJRO ignores the rabbinical summons, then the World Council is free to pursue the matter in a civil court.

Elan Steinberg, and aide to Bronfman, said he had still not received the summons and had not decided how or if he would respond to it. The summons was issued by mail Tuesday.

Various elements of the Jewish community are united on efforts to recover lost assets from Switzerland and elsewhere, but are frequently divided on how to do it and how to distribute the recovered monies afterwards.

While the World Council represents thousands of Hasidic Jews, it has remained outside the fold of more mainstream Jewish organizations.

The WJRO, on the other hand, is recognized by the government of Israel as the official organization to deal with the issue of Jewish restitution.

Many of the World Council's members are originally from eastern European countries where restitution of Jewish property is again becoming a key issue.

The World Council claims to have lost synagogues, Torahs and other communal properties to the Nazis. But they complain that, because the WJRO is handling all negotiations, they cannot get their claims addressed.

The World Council is also a plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit brought by Holocaust survivors against Swiss banks in federal court in New York.
