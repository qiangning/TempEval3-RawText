An Israeli minister called Thursday for a review of the government's policy of imposing closures on the Palestinian territories following anti-Israeli violence, saying the measure may harm national security.

Labor Minister Eli Yishai told Israel radio that travel restrictions routinely slapped on Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in response to attacks damage the Palestinian economy and fuel anti- Israeli militancy.

The closures, imposed to prevent militants from infiltrating to carry out attacks against the Jewish state, keep tens of thousands of day laborers from jobs inside Israel, notably in the farming and construction sectors.

"There has never been a Palestinian with a license to work in Israel who has carried out a terror attack," Yishai said. "We need to give them a living and not cause more and more unemployment,"

"As the closure endures, it doesn't contribute to security and maybe even harms it," he said.

According to Israeli press reports, Yishai's ministry began discussions Thursday on a plan to allow the continual flow of Palestinian laborers into Israel even during security clampdowns.

The plan would include deep security checks by Israeli and Palestinian intelligence agencies to pick those laborers eligible for Israeli work permits. The goal would be to grant at least 80,000 permits valid even during troubles, the Haaretz newspaper said.

Yishai's comments came as the United Nations issued a report saying that closures of the West Bank and Gaza Strip had cost the Palestinian economy more than six billion dollars since 1992.

The UN study found that the gross national product (GNP) for the West Bank and Gaza Strip fell 8.6 percent during 1996, when the territories were sealed almost continually following a spate of Islamic suicide bombings in Israel.

Israel started the practice of closing the territories in response to unrest in 1993 under the leftwing Labor party. The damages caused by the closures include lost wages for day laborers, lost trade revenues and uncollected taxes.

The number of Palestinians authorized to work in Israel hit a peak of 139,200 in 1992, falling to zero for much of 1996.

Since the latest closure imposed after a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on March 21 which killed three Israelis, only three thousand Palestinians are currently authorized to work in Israeli-contolled industrial zones adjacent to the territories.

Discussion of ways to ensure a steady supply of Palestinian laborers coincides with efforts by Israel to wash its hands of foreign workers who cause the country more crime and social problems than Palestinian employees, who return home each night.

"The replacement of foreign workers with Palestinian workers is good for the peace process and the economy, and will prevent all the difficult social problems," labor ministry director general Yigal Ben- Shalom told Haaretz.

Currently, Israel employs about 100,000 foreign workers legally and about 70,000 illegally, in addition to the Palestinians.
