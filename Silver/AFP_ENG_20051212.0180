President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania has been in power for 10 years and is due to stand down after presidential and legislative elections on Wednesday.

GEOGRAPHY: Mainland Tanganyika merged with the Indian Ocean islands of Zanzibar and Pemba to form the nation of Tanzania in 1964. The east African country of 945,000 square kilometres (364,900 square miles) shares borders with Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.

POPULATION: Estimated 35.9 million in 2003 (World Bank figures). Tanzania hosts some 400,000 Burundian and Congolese refugees.

CAPITAL: Dodoma (administrative). Dar es Salaam (economic).

LANGUAGES: Swahili and English (official languages). Many local languages are spoken.

RELIGION: Christian (40 percent), Muslim (40 percent), Animist. Of Zanzibar's one million inhabitants, 98 percent are Muslim.

HISTORY: The British established a protectorate on Zanzibar in 1890 and the Germans took control of the mainland in 1891. German East Africa became British territory in 1920 and took the name Tanganyika. This became independent in 1961, under the Commonwealth, with Julius Nyerere as prime minister. The founding father of Tanzania and follower of African-style Socialism was elected president one year later.

Zanzibar and Pemba -- which both became independent in 1963 -- joined Tanganyika in 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania. Nyerere handed power to Ali Hassan Mwinyi in 1985. Zanzibar and Pemba kept a semi-autonomous status with a separate president and government.

After three decades with one political party, a multi-party system was adopted in Tanzania in 1992. Benjamin Mkapa won the first multi-party general elections in October 1995, as candidate for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM Revolutionary Party), in a poll with "serious irregularities" according to international observers. In Zanzibar, outgoing President Salmin Amour, of the CCM, narrowly won the election.

Mkapa was reelected in 2000 with 71.1 percent of the vote. The CCM won an absolute majority in parliament. In Zanzibar's elections, the opposition and international observers denounced massive fraud, and CCM candidate Amani Abeid Karume won after the main opposition party refused to take part.

ECONOMY: Coffee, cotton, tobacco, sisal and tea are the main exports. The economy of Zanzibar depends mainly on spices, particularly cloves from Pemba island, trade and tourism.

The mining sector has developped considerably in the past 10 years, after the adoption of a liberal economic policy in the middle of the 1980s.

GDP: 220 dollars per inhabitant in 2003 (World Bank).

FOREIGN DEBT: 7,901 billion dollars (6,532 billion euros) in 2004 (World Bank). Tanzania was one of the 18 poorest countries on the planet that saw their debts cancelled by the Group of Eight (G8) leading industrial countries in June 2005.

ARMED FORCES: Estimated at 27,000 soldiers, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies (2004/2005).

The US embassy in Dar es Salaam was the target of a bomb attack on August 7, 1998 that killed 11 Tanzanians and injured 72.
