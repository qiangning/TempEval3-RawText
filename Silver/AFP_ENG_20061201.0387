Egyptian President Hosni Hubarak will hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel here on December 10 to discuss "signs of hope" for peace in the Middle East, the German government said on Friday.

"The German government has an interest to protect, nurture and support the growth of the small but fragile plant which seems to be developing," the government's chief spokesman Thomas Steg said.

He listed the positive signs as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's conciliatory speech to mark the anniversary of the death of Israel's first premier, David Ben Gurion, and moves to encourage Hamas to exchange prisoners with Israel.

"You could say there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon," Steg said.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier started a Middle East tour on Thursday.

Mubarak's visit is part of a flurry of diplomacy as Germany prepares to take over the presidency of the European Union and the Group of Eight most industrialised nations on January 1.
