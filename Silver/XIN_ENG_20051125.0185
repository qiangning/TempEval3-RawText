Raising public awareness of bird flu need eliminate misunderstanding: WHO expert

by Li Xing

BEIJING, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Raising public awareness of bird flu need to eliminate people's misunderstanding on this epidemic, said an expert with the World Health Organization (WHO) here on Friday.

"There was a high degree of fear of H5 bird flu virus both in animals and humans." said Dr. Julie Hall, coordinator of epidemic alert and response in WHO Beijing office, when referring to WHO's mission in central China's Hunan Province.

There were misunderstandings that the people may remain infectious after they recover from bird flu, which they don't, and fears if the disease would spread very quickly between people, which no evidence can prove at the moment, Hall said in an interview by Xinhua.

Therefore these things need to be addressed, such as giving people accurate information, telling people very clearly what to look for in terms of early finding of the symptoms, what to do to protect themselves, and what to do if animals are getting sick, she said.

"So on the trip to Hunan, we recommended a good public education campaign and suggested the authority give people actual, practical and mutual information and help them reject misunderstandings," she said.

Based on her observation, Hall also noted that when someone has died, there appeared to be misconception that the body itself might be infectious and pose risk to people so it must be cremated quickly.

"We believe that it is important to address the people of those misunderstandings so the families can go through proper graving and burial process or cremation. There is no need to cremate body too quickly," she said.

WHO will be working with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on developing some guidelines on this issue, Hall said, "hopefully it will be culturally sensitive and acceptable to the relatives, enable some samples to be taken to make a correct diagnosis, and enable the families to grave and bury the dead in a way they would like."

Earlier this month, five WHO experts went to central China's Hunan Province to look into three pneumonia cases at invitation of MOH. MOH later announced one of the three cases -- a nine-year-old boy -- was a confirmed human case but he has recovered, and his sister who died was a suspected case.

So far, China has reported three confirmed human cases of bird flu, including two fatalities and one recovered case.

WHO experts has been invited again to take part in a joint mission to probe the two confirmed human deaths from bird flu in east China's Anhui Province, which will set off fairly soon, according to WHO Beijing office.

MOH has reported all confirmed cases of bird flu to WHO because of the potential significance of the disease, as other countries do, but they are actually reporting more than they need to and doing more than they have to. "That we feel is very encouraging," said Hall.
