Exports of Christmas commodities made in south China's Guangdong Province are still in the slump that hit the industry in 2004, a local Customs spokesman said.

The officer of the Huangpu Customs of Guangdong said the province's Christmas commodities exports were only 550 million U.S. dollars in the first nine months, just 1.7 percent up on the same period last year.

July, August and September, the mid-season for Christmas commodities, had passed, and the province's exports were unlikely to rise in the final three months, he said.

Guangdong exported 640 million U.S. dollars of Christmas commodities in 2002, a rise of 22.3 percent year-on-year, and its exports in 2003 edged up by 25.2 percent to reach 790 million U.S. dollars.

However, in 2004, Guangdong just exported 630 million U.S. dollars of Christmas commodities, down by 20.1 percent from 2003. The figure last year was 620 million U.S. dollars, down 1.8 percent year-on-year.

Exports of Chinese-made Christmas commodities had been hindered by rising costs of raw materials and increased competition for the foreign markets, said the Customs spokesman.

As Christmas gained in popularity among Chinese, especially young people, many manufacturers have focused on the domestic market and reduced their exports.

Many Chinese Christmas commodities also failed to meet quality and safety standards in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and other countries, said the official.

Customs officers were advising domestic manufacturers to diversify their products and improve quality to sharpen their competitiveness on the international market.

China's total export value of Christmas commodities was about 1.07 billion U.S. dollars each year in 2004 and 2005.
