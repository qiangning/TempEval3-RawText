At least 26 Israeli soldiers have been killed in south Lebanon since the Jewish state's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in the region in April 1996, security sources said Friday.

Attacks against the Israeli-occupied "security zone" in south Lebanon, mainly by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, have also killed 13 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, said the sources.

At least 83 Israeli soldiers have been injured in the attacks along with 34 members of the SLA.

The Islamic Resistance, Hezbollah's military wing, has launched 383 attacks on the buffer strip since last April's Israeli offensive -- dubbed Operation Grapes of Wrath -- according to the security service toll.

A total of 24 Hezbollah fighters were killed in the attacks, it added.

Israeli shelling in response to Hezbollah attacks killed three Lebanese civilians and wounded 36 others during the same period.

Israel's 17-day offensive, launched to stamp out Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel, killed 175 people and injured 350 others, mostly civilians, and also caused an estimated 500 million dollars of damage in south Lebanon.

A five-nation ceasefire monitoring committee set up under the terms of the April 26 truce agreement ending the Israeli offensive has met 14 times, and has received 12 complaints from Lebanon and eight from Israel.

Israel has occupied a "security zone" in south Lebanon since 1985 to protect its northern border from attacks by anti-Israeli fighters.
