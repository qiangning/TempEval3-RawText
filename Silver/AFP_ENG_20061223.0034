The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Saturday it was lending 320 million dollars to help the poor in Pakistan obtain access to wider financial services, including microfinance.

The loans would go to developing a legal and regulatory framework and removing bottlenecks that would allow more of the country's poor access to financial networks, the ADB said in a statement from its headquarters in the Philippine capital.

This would include improving technology for delivering financial services more efficiently and at lower cost and expanding the range and quality of financial products and services "including those for the Islamic market", the ADB said.

The bank would also work to set up public-private partnerships, including reliable business and credit information systems as well as improved, reliable and lower-cost remittance services for overseas workers.

"There is a large potential demand for microfinance services among the poorest people in Pakistan, especially for savings and remittances facilities," the ADB said.

Microfinance reaches fewer than a million people in Pakistan, even though the potential market is about 20 million people, the bank added.

While the microfinance sector has improved, it still does not touch vast numbers of people. This could be addressed by expanding the financial sector's coverage, making it more inclusive and by increasing quality and efficiency, the bank said.
