Serbia registered a 6.1-percent growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first half of 2005 against the same period last year, a government official said on Thursday.

The GDP growth was primarily a result of a major growth of retail trade and wholesale, mobile telephony and the financial sector, said Andra Milojic, assistant director of the Serbian Statistics Bureau.

In 2004, Serbia's GDP rose 9.3 percent in fixed prices ( starting year 2002) to 1300 billion dinars (26.5 billion US dollars).

In fixed prices, GDP represents a sum of gross added values at the sectoral level within the classification of activities calculated in fixed prices, plus taxes and minus product subsidies in fixed prices.
