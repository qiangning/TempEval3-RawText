The European Union renewed its condemnation on Wednesday of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's verbal attacks on Israel, saying they have no place in civilised political debate.

"The comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly. They have no place in civilised political debate," said Britain's Minister for Europe, Douglas Alexander, whose country currently holds the EU presidency.

Speaking in Strasbourg to the applause of European parliamentarians, he said that "the presidency has been unequivocal in its condemnation of the comments attributed to President Ahmadinejad of Iran."

The Islamic republic's hardline leader, who has called for Israel to be wiped off the map, launched a fresh attack on Wednesday, dismissing the Holocaust as a "myth" and saying the Jewish state should be moved as far away as Alaska.

"They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets," the outspoken president said in a speech live on state television.

"If somebody in their country questions God, nobody says anything, but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of Jew, the Zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of Zionism will start to scream," he said.

"Our proposal is this: give a piece of your land in Europe, the United States, Canada or Alaska so they (the Jews) can create their own state."

Speaking in Brussels later, the European Commission's spokeswoman on external affairs also condemned Ahmadinejad's remarks.

"These remarks are just quite simply completely unacceptable," said the spokeswoman Emma Udwin.

"We feel very strongly that Iran is damaging its own interests with these kind of remarks and that such interventions do nothing to rebuild confidence in Iran's intentions," she said.
