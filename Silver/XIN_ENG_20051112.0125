The three-day China International Fruit, Vegetable and Technology Trade Show concluded in Shenzhen, a booming special economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, on Saturday, raising market value for the country's high-quality farm produce.

Among dozens of varieties of fruits on show, the "Pingliang Golden Apple" from northwest China's Gansu Province became the biggest winner. A total of 12 sales contracts worth over 16 million dollars were signed for the fruit at the fair.

The annual show was co-organized by China Fruits Marketing Association (CFMA), China Vegetable Marketing Association, Agropress from Switzerland and China Entry-exit Inspection and Quarantine Association.

The show has attracted over 48,000 visitors, including 6,000 Chinese professionals and 2,000 from abroad, according to Meng Xuanli, manager of Domestic Department of the organizing committee.

Meng roughly estimated that contracts worth 85 million US dollars were signed on the venue of the show.

"The Pingliang apple used to be sold by farmers in local markets only. We wish that our apples could not only become a famous brand in domestic market, but also turn popular across the border," said Ma Xuejun, mayor of Pingliang.

Fruits like honey melon from overseas also interested many visitors. "Thanks to the new zero-tariff policy for Taiwan fruits' entry into the mainland market, we hope to sell more of our products here," says Wu Jia-Hsiung, general manager of the Taiwan-based Chia Kei Ni Industries Co. Ltd.
