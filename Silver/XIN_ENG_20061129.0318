Qatari tennis team will face an uphill battle but never give up easily at the upcoming Asiad tennis tournament, said Qatar's Portuguese tennis coach Luis de Sousa on Tuesday.

"It will be very difficult for us. The team is very young. We have three players under 16. Our goal is to represent Qatar and to dignify the name," Sousa said after the team had a training session at the Khalifa Tennis Courts.

"We have two teenage players who live in Barcelona and go to the tennis academy. The other two boys went to Spain three weeks ago for preparation.

"The surface at Khalifa Courts is perfect for us because we train here practically every day."

The 15th Doha Asian Games tennis tournament will be held from December 4 to 14.
