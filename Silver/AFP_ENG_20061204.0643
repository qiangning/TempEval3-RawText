Major League Baseball Monday announced it will hold its inaugural Civil Rights Game on March 31 as a tribute to one of the most significant eras of social change in US history.

The game will feature the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals and the Cleveland Indians.

It will take place in Memphis - where civil rights leader Martin Luther King jnr was assassinated in 1968 - and will be played at AutoZone Park, home of the Class AAA Memphis Redbirds.

"This game is designed to commemorate the Civil Rights Movement, one of the most critical and important eras of our social history," commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement.

"I am proud of the role that Major League Baseball played in the movement, beginning with Jackie Robinson's entry into the big leagues on April 15, 1947, and very pleased that we have this opportunity to honor the movement and those who made it happen."

Major League Baseball also announced that donations will be made to several charities, including the National Civil Rights Museum and the Jackie Robinson fund, and that filmmaker Spike Lee is creating a documentary showcasing the connection between the Civil Rights Movement and baseball.
