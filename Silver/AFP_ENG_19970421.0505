A total of 109 fires broke out in asylum-seekers' homes in Germany last year, killing 12 people and injuring 107, the German government announced Monday.

Some fires were deliberately set while others were started accidentally, caused by dropped cigarettes or faulty wiring, the government told the lower house of parliament. The interior ministry did not detail how many were of criminal origin.

The issue of fires that target asylum seekers or other foreigners is emotive in Germany where in 1992 and 1993 fires killed eight women and young girls. The fires were believed to have been started by xenophobes.

In March, a deliberately set fire killed three people of Turkish origin at Krefeld in eastern Germany. The father of the family was charged with starting the fire after his wife said she wanted a divorce.
