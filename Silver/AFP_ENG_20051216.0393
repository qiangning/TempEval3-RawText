A gagging order on former Kosovo prime minister and ex-guerrilla commander Ramush Haradinaj has been extended indefinitely, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) said Friday.

Haradinaj, 37, remains barred from making public speeches or participating in political meetings after an appeals chamber ordered the ban to be continued until they have issued a ruling on the matter.

In October 12 a lower court had ruled that Haradinaj could have a limited return to public life, which was supported by the UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.

The prosecution appealed the decision and as the matter was pending the decision was stayed three times to allow the appeals chamber to reach a decision.

The last stay was to end on November 21 but the appeals chamber has now extended it indefinitely until they reach a decision.

Haradinaj, a Kosovo Liberation Army commander during the war against Serbian forces in 1998-99, is charged with war crimes, including murder and rape, committed against Serbian and Albanian civilians.

He resigned as prime minister and surrendered to the tribunal in March this year.
