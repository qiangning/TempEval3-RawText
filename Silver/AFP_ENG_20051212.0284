Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki will visit Pakistan this week for talks with Pakistani leaders likely to touch on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, an official said Monday.

Mottaki -- who was due to arrive in Pakistan on Wednesday -- will be making his first visit to the country since August when he was named to his post, foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam told a weekly press briefing.

"The visit offers a useful opportunity to review bilateral relations and intensify cooperation in areas of mutual interest," she said.

Mottaki was also expected to discuss Iran's controversial nuclear programme with Pakistani officials, she said.

"Yes I think that will be (on the agenda). We will discuss bilateral issues, we will discuss regional and international issues and this will probably figure in the meetings," Aslam said.

Mottaki's visit to Pakistan comes ahead of December 21 talks between Iran and the so-called European Union 3 -- Britain, France and Germany -- on its disputed nuclear programme.

EU-Iran talks collapsed in August when Tehran ended its suspension of uranium conversion, a first step towards enrichment, and the planned talks are aimed at determining if negotiations can resume.

Nuclear-armed Pakistan has figured in the International Atomic Energy Agency's investigation of Iran's atomic fuel reactor programme.

Pakistan in May sent parts from used nuclear centrifuges to the IAEA to allow the agency to compare microscopic traces of uranium on them with those found on devices in Iran.

The IAEA confirmed in August that the particles found at a key nuclear site in Iran were from Pakistani centrifuges, which were passed to Tehran by the disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan.
