Iran coach Branko Ivankovic believes Group D rivals and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal can make the World Cup semi-finals.

"Our group contains very good teams," said the Croatian.

"The favourite is clearly Portugal, they will be in the semi-finals.

"Mexico are a good side, I was very impressed by them at the Confederations Cup. Angola are a new team to me. They have a lot of enthusiasm and a game which is difficult to understand.

"I am proud of my team, we have worked hard recently. Our problem will be in adapting to the different styles - European, African and Latin-American. I hope our players will learn how to respond to the different problems."
