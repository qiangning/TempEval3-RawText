New Zealand's economy could be heading for a hard fall, a report by the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said Wednesday.

New Zealand local media NZPA quoted the report of the Paris- based organization as saying "the economic growth rate was expected to fall to 2.8 percent in 2005, down from 4.4 percent last year."

Monetary tightening by Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard had failed slow domestic demand growth, the OECD economic report said.

The OECD paper examined the rise in house prices, and current valuations against a range of benchmarks. It also reviewed the possibility of a correction of housing prices and real activity.

Bollard last month issued a severe warning of imbalances and " significant excesses" developing in the economy.

The report said New Zealand was an OECD country where the cost of housing and rent had risen much more rapidly than incomes.

In its May economic outlook, the OECD said New Zealand was one of the world's top performers over the past two years.

While the economy was slowing down as higher interest rates took effect, it was heading for a soft landing, said the OECD report.

New Zealand Finance Minister Michael Cullen said Wednesday the latest OECD report on New Zealand should "silence the clamor for tax cuts."

"I agree with the OECD that the current account deficit poses a potential risk to this outlook and that continued careful fiscal management is necessary to mitigate that risk," said Cullen.
