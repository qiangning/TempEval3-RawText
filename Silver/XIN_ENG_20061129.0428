U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as the economy grew by 2.2 percent in third quarter, a better performance than expected.

In midday trading, Dow Jones Industrial Average went up 84.12, to 12,220.57. The Standard and Poor's 500 index gained 11.22 to 1, 397.94, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 19.56 to 2,432.17.

The U.S. economy grew 2.2 percent in the July-September period, a better performance than the estimated 1.6 percent rate, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday.

The growth rate in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was considerably stronger than the 1.8 percent rate that economists had forecast, and less than half the blistering 5.6 percent rate recorded in the first quarter.
