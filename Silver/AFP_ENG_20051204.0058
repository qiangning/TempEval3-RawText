South African President Thabo Mbeki will travel to Ivory Coast on Monday, joining Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Mamadou Tanjda of Niger in a bid to end the deadlock over the choice of a prime minister for the troubled west African nation.

"They are expected to assist the Cote d'Ivorians find a common candidate for the post of prime minister," said a foreign ministry statement released on Sunday.

The UN Security Council last week expressed deep concern over the failure of Ivory Coast's feuding parties to agree on a new prime minister who would have full powers to run an interim government and organise a presidential election by October 31, 2006.

Obasanjo, who chairs the African Union, Mbeki and Tandja sought to break the deadlock over the choice of a prime minister during talks in Abidjan two weeks ago but the parties rejected their candidates.

A former French colony, Ivory Coast has been divided since fighting broke out in 2002, pitting President Laurent Gbagbo's government against rebels who control the north of the country.

Mbeki, who has been named by the African Union to act as special mediator in the conflict, discussed the situation in Ivory Coast in talks with French President Jacques Chirac, on the sidelines of a Africa-France summit held at the weekend in Bamako.

Following Mbeki's scheduled one-day visit to Abidjan, Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma will take part in a meeting on Tuesday of an international working group overseeing the peace process in Ivory Coast.
