A dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas supplies to the strategic transit country should not be politicised, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday after a telephone discussion with Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yushchenko.

"We are in agreement on not politicising the question of gas," Putin said, quoted by the Interfax news agency.

Yushchenko had assured Putin that he would not allow "the politicisation of this question and I agree with him," the Russian leader said.

"A market exists and all our partners should benefit from equal conditions. Economic matters are one thing, politics another," Putin said.

Analysts have detected in the current dispute Moscow's disapproval of last year's "orange revolution", which set Kiev on a pro-Western course.

The Russian energy giant Gazprom has said the dispute threatens supplies through Ukraine to other European countries, the main transit route for Russian gas supplies to Europe.

The dispute centres on a demand by Gazprom that Ukraine pay market prices for gas supplies to Ukrainian consumers, rather than sticking to the current barter arrangement whereby Ukraine gets cut-price gas in exchange for providing transit to other countries.

Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller said earlier this week that supplies to the Ukrainian market could be cut altogether if Kiev did not agree to the company's terms by January 1.
