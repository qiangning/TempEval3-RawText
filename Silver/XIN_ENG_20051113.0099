At the concluding session of 13th SAARC summit, Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia said that India has offered to host the next summit and the 7-member states of SAARC have welcomed it.

Zia also said that the 13th summit has decided to set up a SAARC Surveillance and Rapid Response System to deal with health concerns such as bird flu, that has affected several countries in East Asia.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who will serve as the chairman of the next summit, called on all SAARC member countries to settle issues to facilitate implementation of South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) by January 2006.
