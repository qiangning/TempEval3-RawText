Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has played down suggestions by his captain Steven Gerrard that the club can still pip Manchester United and Chelsea to the title.

Benitez's side host bottom club Watford at Anfield on Saturday seeking to cement their position in the top three by securing a fourth successive league win.

After a slow start to the season, the Merseyside club enter the busy Christmas period on the back of their best domestic form of the campaign prompting England midfielder Gerrard to suggest that the title is still possible despite trailing leaders United by 13 points.

Benitez has masterminded Champions League and FA Cup triumphs since he arrived at Anfield in 2004. But he has endured too many setbacks in the league to get carried and is taking a more cautious approach as he prepares to celebrate his third Christmas in England.

"If Steven was talking about this then it means he has confidence and he is positive," said Benitez.

"But as an experienced manager it is better to talk about one game at a time and think about the next three points.

"We have four games in the space of a few days over Christmas and we will see after these four games where we are in the table. But I am not thinking about the title race. I'm not looking at the table every week, I promise you."

Liverpool are unbeaten in their last six league outings since last month's tame 3-0 surrender at Arsenal which appeared to have killed off their hopes of catching the top two.

But Benitez insisted that he never doubted his players when the critics wrote them off, and has saluted his team for the way they have responded in recent weeks.

"We still had confidence when everyone was talking about us being in mid-table and struggling," added Benitez.

"We said to the players 'listen, we will move closer to the top if we carry on doing the same things'.

"One of the best things about my players is that they are really good workers. They train really well and as a manager you know that when your team trains hard, they will be near the top of the table because they have enough quality."

Watford arrive at Anfield six points adrift of safety at the foot of the table and still seeking a first league win of the season.

Manager Adrian Boothroyd has been optimistic about his side's survival chances throughout the season, but has admitted for the first time that his players are in a relegation battle.

"I set our sights high, but I know we are in a relegation battle," said the 35-year-old handler.

"We need to add new players in January, but I am convinced we can go on a little run.

"But even so, I am not a realist - I refuse to be. When you believe in conventional wisdom, you have a problem.

"We are bottom of the league, and we need to fight for everything we can. I know what we have to do, and I believe we will do it."
