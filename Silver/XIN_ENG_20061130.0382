A Metro train struck two employees working on the track near the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C., on Thursday, killing one and critically injuring another, officials said.

The workers, both men, were walking the tracks doing routine inspections when the accident took place in the morning.

They were hit by an empty four-car train from Huntington to the Alexandria rail yard, which was near the Eisenhower Station, in Alexandria, Virginia, Metro spokeswoman Cathy Asato said.

A section of the Yellow Line was shut down following the accident, and shuttle buses were used to transport passengers in several stations. Officials said the accident was under investigation.

Thursday's fatality was the 14th for the Metrorail system in its 30-year history and the third serious one involving Metro trains and its workers, media reports said.

Also on Thursday, two freight trains derailed in North Baltimore, a small town in Ohio. One of the trains derailed, sending wreckage into another train nearby knocking some of its cars off the track.

It was not known immediately how many people were injured in the accident and what caused the first train to derail, reports said.
