An avatar made up to look like French presidential candidate Segolene Royal has made an appearance in the popular virtual world of Second Life, though it is not piloted by the politician or her any of her supporters.

Vincent Feltesse, the head of the "new technologies division" of Royal's Socialist party, told AFP the character -- known as Segolene RoyalE -- had been spotted some time ago but nothing had been done to stop it.

"That's just par for the course for the 'net," he said.

He added that, while the behaviour of the avatar was "sophomoric" and not approved of by the party, it would go unhindered "as long as it's not an initiative controlled by a PR agency."

A French free newspaper, Metro, on Wednesday conducted an interview with the character.

Second Life, a vast online world created by a San Francisco technology company called Linden Lab, counts around two million "residents", or virtual characters whose likenesses are made up by members.

The computerised environment has attracted several real-world companies, including car manufacturers and sports clothing makers, which created 3-D stores.

It also has a branch of the French far-right group the National Front, which was opened by its youth movement to promote the presidential candidacy of its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
