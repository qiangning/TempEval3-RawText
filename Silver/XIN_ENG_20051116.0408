Jordanian King Abdullah II on Wednesday welcomed the latest agreement reached between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority on a Gaza-Egypt border crossing.

The development was a positive step pushing forward the Middle East peace process, Abdullah told visiting Quartet's Middle East Envoy James Wolfensohn, who had been been overseeing the Israeli-Palestinian talks over the past five months.

The Jordanian king hoped the long-awaited agreement could help the Palestinians improve their freedom of movement and economic activities.

Wolfensohn said the Quartet will monitor the implementation of the deal clinched on Tuesday on the Rafah crossings after intense talks brokered by visiting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Under the agreement, the two sides will reopen the crossing on Nov. 25, which is Gaza's only link with the outside world not passing through Israel and has been largely closed since the historic withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory in September.

The Quartet groups key Middle East peace brokers of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.
