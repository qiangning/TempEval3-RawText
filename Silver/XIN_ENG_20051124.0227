The Finnish government finalized Thursday the working-out of an energy and climate strategy in which it promises to invest in the fields of renewable energy sources, energy conservation, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

This strategy, to be given as a report to Parliament, aims to meet international requirements for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in Finland during the Kyoto commitment period of 2008- 2012.

The target set in the strategy is that the total consumption of renewable energy would increase by at least one quarter by 2015, and by at least 40 per cent by the year 2025. Renewable energy could then account for nearly one third of primary energy consumption, as against 23 per cent in 2003.

In particular, the strategy emphasizes the increased utilization of wood chips made from logging waste, as well as field biomass, recycled fuels and biogas. The target is at least to triple their share of primary energy, from about two per cent in 2004 to over six per cent within the next 15-20 years.

The government emphasizes that indigenous energy sources, renewable energy sources and biofuels, play an important role in the security of energy supply. The goal is that the total consumption of indigenous energy sources will rise by at least one quarter during the next 10-15 years.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry has launched an investigation on how the role of peat could be secured against imported fuels in the generation of electricity in condensing power plants.

In Finland, important results have already been achieved in increasing the efficiency of energy use.

The government will intensify these efforts by introducing new energy conservation measures. The goal is to reach an additional reduction of five per cent in energy consumption by the year 2015. The long-term goal in energy conservation is to halt the growth of total primary energy consumption and to bring about a falling trend.

In the strategy, the government promises to invest in renewable energy sources, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition, by utilizing the Kyoto mechanisms, Finland will acquire emission units allowed by the Kyoto Protocol.

Through the actions outlined in the strategy and through flexible mechanisms, such as emissions trading within the EU, Finland will meet the obligations set and approved for it.

Without these measures, Finland's greenhouse gas emissions would exceed the target set by the Kyoto Protocol by about 15 per cent.
