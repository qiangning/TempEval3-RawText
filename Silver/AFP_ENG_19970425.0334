A 59-year-old electronics company executive arrived in Osaka Friday to become the first of 24 Japanese hostages to return home after being held hostage for four months in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.

Shigeru Taki, the president of the Peruvian subsidiary of Osaka-based Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp., arrived at Kansai International Airport with his 60-year-old wife Tetsuyo.

Confined to a wheelchair, Taki was greeted at the airport by his two daughters, aged 27 and 24, along with officials from Matsushita and the Japanese foreign ministry.

Taki said he sprained his right ankle after jumping from the roof of the residence Tuesday when Peruvian troops stormed the compound, rescuing all but one of the 72 hostages and killing all 14 rebels.

"I am home, free at last after 127 days of captivity," he told a news conference at an airport hotel, thanking the Peruvian and Japanese governments, the Red Cross and the panel of guarantors for their efforts to find a solution.

Taki also paid tribute to two soldiers and one hostage who died in the raid Tuesday.

"I sincerely express my regret over the death of Supreme Court Justice Carlos Giusti, with whom I shared every moment, and over the deaths of two soldiers who sacrificed their lives," he said.

His wife travelled to Lima in mid-January for the painful vigil and recalled the moment when the 140 crack troops stormed the residence in broad daylight.

"When I saw the smoke coming out, I thought I would never see him again," she said.

"I was really glad to learn that my husband was safe and sound. I am happy, indeed, that he is back alright."
