Bulgaria captured their first medal in 20 years by beating Serbia and Montenegro to finish third in the men's world volleyball championships on Sunday.

The Bulgarian men, who have not won a medal since the 1986 worlds, coasted to a close 22-25, 25-23, 25-23, 25-23 victory over the 2000 Olympic champions.

"We are very happy, because after 20 years we received this medal. It doesn't matter (whether it's gold or silver), it's the bronze, but it's very important for us," said Bulgarian captain Plamen Konstantinov.

"Life is interesting, because yesterday it was the most disappointing day and today is the happiest day for us. We found power to win this game after yesterday's match."

Bulgaria's coach Martin Stoev said his team had bigger motivation than the Serbians, because they had not won a medal in the past 20 years.

"The Serbians won the Olympic gold medal, and they have medals from the European championships and the world championships. We didn't win anything in the last 20 years. That's why we had better motivation for today," said Stoev.

It was Bulgaria's fourth bronze medal in the world championships, following medals in 1949, 1952 and 1986. They also won the silver medal in 1970.

It was Serbia and Montenegro's last international tournament as a united team, since the countries declared their independence in June after a referendum in Montenegro.

"We came here with a big wish to have the best possible way to say goodbye to big international competitions with the name of Serbia and Montenegro. Also I think some of the players who will say goodbye to the national team deserved to win the medal," said Serbian coach Igor Kolakovic.

"Unfortunately we weren't strong enough to win the medal before we left the competition."

It was the last tournament for Vladimir Grbic, the elder brother of Bulgarian captain Nikola Grbic, who announced his retirement before the championships.

"This was his last tournament for the national team," admitted the captain. "I also have to think about it, because I will become a father in a month. It's a completely new situation for me."
