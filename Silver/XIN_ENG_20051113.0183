The woman suicide bomber in Wednesday's Amman hotel bombing attacks confessed that she was told to carry out the bombing, the official Jordanian television reported on Sunday.

Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi, an Iraqi national, appeared on the television with explosives strapped around her waist.

The 35-year-old confessed to failing in her mission of carrying out the attack, which killed at least 57 people in Radisson, Grand Hyatt and Days Inn hotels in the Jordanian capital Wednesday night and wounded over 110 others.

She said she was told by her husband, Ali Hussein Ali al- Shamari who was identified as one of another three Iraqi suicide bombers, to wear an explosive belt, but she failed to blow herself up when accompanying her husband to attack Radisson Hotel.

The other two were identified as Rawad Jassem Mohammed Abed and Safaa Mohammed Ali.

Earlier reports said the woman was sister of a senior aide of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of al-Qaida in Iraq. The aide was killed by US-Iraqi forces in Iraq earlier this year.

Al-Shamari and his wife were disguised as guests to a wedding party held in Radisson Hotel before the attack, Jordanian authorities said.

Al-Qaida terror group in Iraq has claimed responsibility for the blasts in an Internet statement.

In the wake of the bloodshed, Jordan has vowed to hunt down the attackers and those behind the blasts. Scores of suspects have been rounded up by Jordanian police across the country and investigations are underway.
