South Korea has mounted a 37,000- strong team for security of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum being held from Nov. 12 to 19 in the country's coastal city of Busan.

The South Korean military and police security personnel have mapped out a set of comprehensive measures to counter the possible airborne and sea-based terror attacks during the summit, according to an APEC forum security official on Saturday.

The security team has launched guard operations for the country 's land, sea and air routes.

Around the Busan Exhibition and Convention Center where a series of APEC meetings will be held, police are on high alert and have strengthened security.

An 11-strong mounted police team started patrols as of Saturday. The team will patrol around the center from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. until the end of meeting.

According to an official of the Busan Police Bureau, the advantage of the mounted police is that the policemen can enter into places where cars and other motor vehicles cannot reach. In addition, they can help maintain orders with a higher point of view in case a riot happens.

The official said an airborne early warning system and anti- submarine aircraft provide defense against hostile infiltration. And the early-warning aircraft will launch round-the-clock patrol of the territorial sky of the country during the APEC Summit scheduled from Nov.18 to 19.

All conference-related venues and facilities will be covered by air patrols using F-16 fighters, and vessels sailing near the port are to be cordoned off seven kilometers away from the summit venue.

Officials at the Construction and Transportation Ministry said on Friday that they will enforce no-fly zone from Nov. 16 to 21 within a 5.6 kilometer radius of the summit venues and major accommodation facilities.

High-speed patrol boats with thermal detection camera are also in operation.

To prevent the entrance of terrorist suspects who may come in disguise as tourists, all passengers using Busan's Gimhae International Airport are required to open up their luggage for thorough inspection.

Officials at Busan Customs said they have deployed 265 personnel around seaports to prevent any smuggling materials and launched around-the-clock watches by installing 105 closed circuit televisions.

At Incheon Airport, passengers are even required to take off their shoes for security checks, and staff members there said "it' s merely a routine work."

A total of 3,000 volunteers will be deployed at 73 stations of two subways for help maintain security. Big department stores and shopping malls will be closed during the APEC summit.
