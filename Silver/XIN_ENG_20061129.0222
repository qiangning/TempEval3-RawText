Bangaldeshi President and Chief Advisor Professor Iajuddin Ahmed told a visiting UN special envoy here Wednesday that all steps are taken to hold free, fair, neutral and peaceful parliamentary elections, private news agency UNB reported.

Iajuddin urged the UN to send election observers to Bangladesh.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy, Craig Genness, arrived here Wednesday morning carrying his message for the caretaker government and the political leaders of Bangladesh that the world organization is concerned over the political situation stemming from electoral issues here.

He called on Ahmed in the afternoon in the first instance before talks with the political parties on both sides of the political division concerning the contentious electoral issues.

Listing to the measures taken to remove hurdles to the polls, Professor Ahmed told the envoy that the Chief Election Commissioner MA Aziz went on leave, two new Election Commissioners were appointed in view of some political parties' demand for creating congenial atmosphere for the elections while the EC announced the election schedule.

Besides, he said, contract jobs at different levels have been canceled and necessary reshuffles in the administration done for impartial elections.

The President pointed out that, as a constitutional body, the Election Commission has initiated all steps to hold free and fair elections. He assured the envoy of fair polls going to be held in the country, following such comprehensive groundwork.

"The party who will secure electoral mandate will form the next government," he told the UN emissary.

Reiterating country's commitment to the United Nations, the president said Bangladesh has been playing a lead role in various programs of the world body, including the UN peacekeeping mission.

He thanked the UN secretary general for extending cooperation in advancing democratic process in Bangladesh.

In response, the special envoy said the UN does not like to see any political violence in Bangladesh and noted that all problems can be resolved through the holding of peaceful elections.

"The United Nations is concerned at the violence on street," Genness was quoted by a President House spokesman as saying during the meeting with the President. He thanked the chief advisor for taking the initiatives for holding free and fair polls.

The envoy requested the chief advisor to take steps for establishment of peace in the country.

Genness informed the president that he would convey the UN Secretary General's concern about "political violence" during his meetings with the leaders of major political parties.

Both the President and the envoy observed with unanimity of views that all parties should come forward, realizing the reality, for maintaining peace and advancing democracy in the country.

Since the former ruling BNP-led 4-party alliance government led by former prime minister Khaleda Zia ended its tenure on Oct. 27, the former main opposition Awami League (AL)-led 14-party combine had staged three rounds of countrywide blockade demanding reconstitution of Election Commission paving way for fair elections due in January next.

Awami League announced Monday if their demands are not met, they will stage another round of blockade from Sunday.

During the blockades, there were dozens of people killed and thousands wounded in clashes between supporters of BNP and AL. The country's economy suffered a great loss.

According to the Constitution, a neutral caretaker government supervises the country's elections within 90 days since 1996.
