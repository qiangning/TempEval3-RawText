LUSAKA, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's sugar output in the first half production year ending Sept. 30, 2006 increased by 3,000 tons compared with the same period of last year, according to Zambia Sugar Plc.

The sugar production is expected to exceed 250,000 tons this year, Zambia Daily Mail reported on Wednesday.

Secretary of the company Lovemore Sievu said the company registered revenue amounting to 307. 4 billion kwacha (about 78.82 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of the year compared with 270.1 billion kwacha (about 69.26 million dollars) in the same period of last year.

The combination of cost and productivity improvements resulted in a slight improvement on operating margins, he said.

Exports and revenues have benefited from an additional EU quota allocations and also improved regional market prices, Sievu said.

The maintenance of operating margins and exchange rate will remain significant to the final profitability of the company for this year, the secretary added.
