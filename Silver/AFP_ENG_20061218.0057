The Norwegian oil company Statoil is to take over the oil and gas activities of Norsk Hydro and create the largest offshore production group, the two groups said on Monday.

The new company will be 62.5 percent state-owned and given a new name, which was not disclosed.

Both companies' boards as well as the government have approved the takeover, which is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2007.

The merged entity will have a combined production of 1.9 million barrels per day in 2007 and proven oil and gas reserves of 6.3 billion barrels of oil equivalents.

"This is the start of a new era. We are creating a global energy company and strengthening Norway's oil and gas industry," Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.

"The government sees the recommended merger as industrially and strategically well founded," he said.

The state is expected to eventually raise its stake to 67 percent.

Norsk Hydro will continue to operate as an aluminium company under its existing name.

Norway is the world's third largest oil exporter, behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.

"By combining forces, the new company will be a highly competent and financially strong Norwegian-based energy champion, well positioned to ensure continued domestic excellence and pursue international business opportunities for long-term growth," said Jan Reinaas and Jannik Lindbaek, the chairmen of the Board of Directors of Hydro and Statoil, respectively, in a joint statement. "The industry faces an increasingly challenging international landscape. To merge now makes perfect sense."

Hydro will continue as a leading, focused global aluminium company.
