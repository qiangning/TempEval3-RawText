U.S. President George W. Bush's national security adviser Stephen Hadley has expressed serious doubts about Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Malik's capacity to control sectarian violence in the war-torn country, the New York Times reported Wednesday.

In his Nov. 8 memorandum prepared for Bush, Hadley recommended that the U.S. take new steps to strengthen the Iraqi leader's position.

"His (Maliki) intentions seem good when he talks with Americans. ..But the reality on the streets of Baghdad suggest Maliki is either ignorant of what is going on, misrepresenting his intentions, or that his capabilities are not yet sufficient to turn his good intentions into action," the memo said.

Hadley suggests that if Maliki fails to carry out series of specified steps, it may ultimately be necessary to press him to reconfigure his parliamentary bloc, a step Washington could support by providing "monetary support to moderate groups," and by sending thousands of additional U.S. troops to Baghdad to make up for what the document suggests is a current shortage of Iraqi forces.

The White House has sought to avoid public criticism of Maliki, who is due to meet Bush in Jordan later Wednesday.
