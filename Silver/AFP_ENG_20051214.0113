Iran's hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad launched a fresh attack against Israel on Wednesday, dismissing the Holocaust as a "myth" and saying the Jewish state should be moved as far away as Alaska.

And with just a week to go before scheduled talks with the European Union -- which is seeking guarantees Tehran will not acquire atomic weapons -- the outspoken president vowed he would not compromise "one iota" on its nuclear programme.

"They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets," the controversial right-winger declared in a speech carried live on state television.

"If somebody in their country questions God, nobody says anything, but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of Jews, the Zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of Zionism will start to scream," he said.

"Our proposal is this: give a piece of your land in Europe, the United States, Canada or Alaska so they (the Jews) can create their own state."

His comments drew swift condemnation from the European Union and Iran's arch-enemy Israel.

Ahmadinejad, a hardcore Islamic revolutionary who won a shock election victory in June, has already sparked international outrage over a string of anti-Israeli outbursts.

In October he said Israel "must be wiped off the map", and last week said Israel was a "tumour" that should be moved to Germany or Austria -- comments that were also condemned by the United Nations Security Council.

But his latest comments remove any doubt that he also backs revisionist historians -- often branded in the West as neo-Nazis -- who maintain Nazi Germany's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million Jews between 1933 and 1945 never took place.

"Why, under the pretext of this massacre, have you come to the heart of Palestine and the Islamic world ..., why have you created an artificial Zionist regime?" he said.

In a sharp response, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev told AFP that Ahmadinejad's comments reflected a "perverse vision of the world held by this regime and underline the danger should such an extremist regime have a nuclear capacity in the future."

"We hope these extremist comments by the Iranian president will make the international community open its eyes," he said.

Israel has consistently called for international action to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, with its chief of staff Dan Halutz claiming on Tuesday that Tehran would have all the necessary knowledge to build a warhead within three months.

The EU also condemned Ahmadinejad's remarks.

"The comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly. They have no place in civilised political debate," said Britain's Minister for Europe Douglas Alexander, whose country currently holds the EU presidency.

The EU big-three -- Britain, France and Germany -- are expected to meet Iranian officials on December 21 in a bid to kick-start stalled diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear drive.

But Ahmadinejad spelled out that Iran was not ready to give in to demands to limit its work on the nuclear fuel cycle -- a process the regime insists is only directed to making electricity but which can also be extended to make weapons.

"Be certain that we will not back away one iota from our legitimate nuclear rights," said Ahmadinejad, who was speaking to thousands of people in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan.

"We have experienced your attitude and we will no longer be duped by your lying propoganda."

The EU, backed by the United States, is now pinning its hopes for a compromise under which Iran's enrichment work would be carried out in Russia, although this has also been rejected by Tehran.

The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has still not ruled -- after an almost three-year investigation -- on whether Iran's nuclear programme is peaceful.
