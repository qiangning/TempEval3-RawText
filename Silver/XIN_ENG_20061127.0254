Seven people were killed in a colliery accident in Southwest China on Monday, bringing the death toll in coal mine tragedies to 85 over the past three days across the country.

Eleven workers who were sorting impurities from a coal heap were buried when the heap collapsed at 9:47 a.m. at the Shuicheng Coal Mine Group colliery, in mountainous province of Guizhou.

Seven workers died and four were rescued, said the work safety administration in Liupanshui city, where the mine group is located.

The cause of the accident is being investigated.

The past weekend has been tragic with three mine disasters leaving at least 78 people dead. Investigations show coal miners continued production even after government ordered to halt production at the three mines amid safety concerns.

Twenty-two miners were confirmed dead and five others missing in Saturday's gas blast in Yuanhua Coal Mine in Jixi, a city in northeastern Heilongjiang Province.

Three managers responsible for the blast have been arrested, said local police. An investigation shows at the end of August, the mine was forced by local government to halt production due to outdated work safety license, but the owners continued production.

In another tragedy, 32 miners were killed and 28 injured in a colliery gas explosion at Changyuan Coal Mine in Fuyuan, a county in southwestern Yunnan Province.

Investigation shows the mine owners started production at the Chuangyuan mine before they got all the required licenses.

A third gas blast on Sunday hit Luweitan Colliery in Linfen city, North China's coal-rich province of Shanxi, killing all 24 miners underground, the local government said on Monday.

It added the mine's production permit and safety license have both expired.

"We can't put up with the owner's illegal production with no consideration to miners lives," said Liang Jiakun, vice director of the State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS), in Jixi. He has earlier arrived at there to coordinate rescue effort and investigation.

Liang said the disaster also highlighted the local government's insufficient efforts to crack down on illegal mining.

Chen Qiwen, a county official in Guizhou, was jailed Monday for a ten-year term on taking 730,000 yuan (93,000 U.S. dollars) in bribes from coal mine owners. He offered them safety licenses after their mines were ordered to halt production amid safety concerns.

Chinese coal mines suffer frequent explosions, flooding and cave-ins, claiming about 6,000 lives a year.

Unsafe small coal mines account for two-thirds of the total fatalities in mine accidents, government figures show.

The SAWS said earlier China will seal off 2,652 small mines with an annual output of less than 30,000 tons this year and another 2,209 next year.

Amid efforts to avoid huge fatalities, China will allow no more than 100 miners to work underground per shift in state-owned coal mines, said Zhao Tiechui, director of the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety. He said this is feasible for all 176 mines owned by 13 state-owned enterprises.
