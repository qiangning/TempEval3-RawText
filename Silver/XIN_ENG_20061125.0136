The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison troops in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Saturday conducted its ninth troop rotation since it assumed Hong Kong's defense responsibility on July 1, 1997.

The annual rotation started at 00:00 Nov. 25 when a number of military vehicles of the ground troops rolled across the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint into Hong Kong under the escort of the Hong Kong police.

Six military helicopters landed at the Skek Kong Barracks in the morning. The last part of the rotation was carried out at the Stonecutters Island Naval Base.

The naval rotation involved a missile escort vessel, a landing ship.

The annual rotation was conducted in accordance with the HKSAR Garrison Law of the People's Republic of China.

The size of the forces remained unchanged in both personnel and weaponry after the rotation, said Lieutenant Colonel Cheng Dongfang, spokesman for the PLA garrison troops in Hong Kong.
