Six Japanese left Kinshasa Sunday as part of an evacuation called for by the Japanese embassy, embassy charge d'affaire Seromi Okamoto said.

The six, five women and a child, left by ferry across the Zaire river to the Congolese capital Brazzaville. The women were all married to Zaireans.

Okamoto said the embassy had called for the evacuation since Japan did not have troops in the region to rescue its nationals in case of emergency.

The situation is increasingly tense as rebels have said they will be in Kinshasa before June and the government has been cracking down on opposition protests in the capital.

It was apparently the first time in the Zairean crisis that an embassy has urged all its nationals to leave the country.

A Chinese woman Catherine Chan evacuated with the Japanese told reporters: "Yeah, we're afraid. We're frightened. We don't know what will happen.

"The situation really is deteriorating every day," she said.

There were a total of 39 Japanese in Zaire, not counting the five embassy staff in Kinshasa, when the embassy on April 4 urged all Japanese to leave who did not have business in Zaire, Okamoto said.

But three days ago Japanese were advised to leave the country, without any conditions being attached.

Eleven Japanese -- including two children -- are still in Zaire and have refused to leave. Okamoto said there were two Japanese Catholic nuns in Kinshasa and four Catholic nuns elsewhere in Zaire.

Five diplomats, all male, also remain.

US ambassador Daniel Simposon said there was no heightened readiness at the US embassy for an evacuation.

Belgium, Britain, France and the United States have troops in the neighboring Congolese capital of Brazzaville, ready to evacuate their nationals if necessary.
