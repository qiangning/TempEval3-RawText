The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has suspended airline operating certificates of five domestic carriers to sanitize the ailing aviation industry, local media reported on Sunday.

The affected airlines are Sosoliso, IRS, Space World, Fresh Air and Dasab. The NCAA revoked ADC's certificate on October 30 after its B737-200 aircraft crashed in Abuja one day earlier, killing 98 people.

The NCAA at the weekend withdrew the certificates for what it described as their "flouting safety rules, (and) operation of one airplane."

Sosoliso was specifically accused of using bad tires in the fleet of its aircraft which recorded an air crash on Dec. 10, 2005 which killed 108 people, including more than 60 teenage students.

Managing Director of Sosoliso Airlines Oscar Ikwuemesi confirmed the suspension, but explaining that the airline's management was meeting with the NCAA to resolve the problem.

The affected airlines' billboards had been removed from their counters at the domestic wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos.

Aviation Minister Femi Fani-Kayode said on Friday at his maiden interactive forum with journalists that he was going to be firm in the area of aviation safety, adding that he would give the aviation regulatory body "all the necessary backing to sanitize the industry."

Fani-Kayode said he was happy that the NCAA autonomy bill had been signed into law by President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday. He, however, reiterated that more domestic carriers would be giving internationally lucrative routes, noting that the airlines would only grow if they were given choice routes.
