Pope Benedict XVI learned with "deep distress" of the "unlawful" ordination of a Chinese bishop without papal approval, the Vatican said in a statement on Saturday.

China's state-run Catholic Church on Thursday ordained Wang Renlei, 36, as Bishop of Xuzhou in the eastern province of Jiangsu. He became the fourth bishop ordained in China this year without the blessing of the Vatican.

The ordination "is the last of these unlawful ordinations of bishops which have been tormenting the Catholic Church in China for dozens of years", the Vatican's statement said.

"(They) create divisions within the diocesan community and trouble the religious sentiments of many priests and worshippers."

These "extremely serious" acts are the consequence "of a vision of the Church which does not correspond to the Catholic doctrine and which is opposed to the fundamental principles of its hierarchical structure", the statement continued.

The ordination was announced at the start of the week by China's Catholic Church.

The Vatican warned of severe sanctions in canonical law for such ordinations but did not say whether Xuzhou's case fell into this category.

It praised the majority of Chinese priests and believers for maintaining strong faith links with Rome.

China's millions of Catholics are divided between a "patriotic" church, with around four million faithful, and a clandestine church following the Vatican, with around 10 million believers.

The ordination of three Chinese bishops without Vatican approval in the spring led the pope to denounce a "serious violation of religious freedom". This was despite discussions between Beijing and the Vatican aimed at normalising bilateral relations, which were broken off in the early 1950s.
