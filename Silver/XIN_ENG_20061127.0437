UN peacekeeping forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and government troops have driven rebel soldiers out of an eastern town they had captured at the weekend, the UN mission announced Monday.

The UN mission, known by its French acronym MONUC, said that its blue helmets (UN forces), fighting alongside the National Army Force in the DRC (FARDC), launched air strikes on the rebel 81st and the 83rd brigades loyal to General Laurent Nkunda.

The rebel soldiers began to retreat from the town of Sake under the pressure of UN attack helicopters and ground forces. The MONUC suffered no casualties, it said.

Nkunda's men launched attacks on Saturday, taking the town of Sake which is close to Goma, the chief town of North-Kivu province. The FARDC formed its defense at Kazingani, a few kilometers to the east of Sake, after abandoning the town on Sunday. The fighting has killed eight people.

The MONUC said blue helmets were tightening patrol around Goma to ensure the situation remained stable and citizens were safe. It was trying its utmost to prevent the flare-up from approaching the city.

In June 2004, Nkunda, a disgraced Tutsi general of the FARDC, led his soldiers in rebellion against President Joseph Kabila. They kept a week-long occupation of Bukavu, capital of South-Kivu province.

Since then, the Tutsi general has been under an international warrant for war crimes and crime against humanity committed in Bukavu. His whereabouts has never been officially reported till now. He is thought to be in the North-Kivu province close to the Rwanda border.
