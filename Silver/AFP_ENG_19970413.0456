China has told Hong Kong people living abroad with foreign passports they need not race home before the transfer of power on July 1 to retain permanent residency in the territory.

A spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said emigrants who have taken foreign nationality would be able to retain their permanent residency if they return to the territory within 18 months of the handover.

Those who reside in, or return to, the territory before July 1 would also be granted right of abode, the spokesman said in a statement released through the official Xinhua news agency late Sunday.

The Chinese government hoped that the future government of the Special Administrative Region (SAR), as Hong Kong will be known under Chinese rule, would work out detailed regulations "as soon as possible", the spokesman said.

China has been seeking Britain's opinion on the subject, he added.

The question of right of abode has been on the agenda of the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group for some time. But last month a meeting of the body, a joint forum to discuss Hong Kong's transitional matters, failed to reach agreement on the subject.

The statement followed similar comments by Wang Fengchao, deputy director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, during a visit to Hong Kong on April 4.

During a visit to Hong Kong, Wang attempted to answer questions about the thorny issue of nationality.

Wang said these "back-flow immigrants" would enjoy right of abode "no matter when they return to Hong Kong."

That would be the case as long as these people do not declare that they are foreign nationals to the Hong Kong immigration department, he added.

China does not accept the concept of dual nationality for its nationals, but has said Hong Kong Chinese who hold foreign passports may retain them for use merely as travel documents.

Foreigners who had been previously living in Hong Kong could assert their right of abode, provided they do so within a "set time limit" after the handover, Wang said. The time limit would be set by the future SAR government, he said.

There were fears that Hong Kong people currently working or studying abroad would have to rush back before the July 1 handover or risk losing their right of abode.

This highly prized status allows them to live and work in Hong Kong without a work permit.

Wang warned, however, that China refused to recognise foreign passports held by Hongkongers who had not declared foreign citizenship.

Millions of Hongkongers have foreign passports, many of them acquired secretly to provide the holder with an escape route if the handover goes wrong.

Wang said that such passports could not be used for gaining consular protection if the holder ran foul of the law in Hong Kong or mainland China.

These rules also apply to local residents who hold British passports, he added.

Around half of Hong Kong's 6.4 million population have British National Overseas passports, which can be used for visa-free travel but specifically refuse the holder the right of abode in Britain.

Another 50,000 heads of household and their families were granted full British passports under a nationality scheme designed as a safety net for key Hong Kong professionals, introduced after China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square.

Even those with the full British passports will not be considered British by Chinese authorities, Wang said.

Wang stressed that, in China's eyes, Hong Kong residents cannot declare "a change of nationality" by holding any British passport, he said.
