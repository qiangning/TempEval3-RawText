Four workers trapped in Sunday's railway tunnel collapse in southwest China's Yunnan Province are still alive, an official with the provincial railway administration said Tuesday.

Rescuers got in touch with the trapped workers after they dug a pipeline of 108 mm in diameter on Monday afternoon to get through the earth and rocks blocking the tunnel, said the official, who declined to give his name.

The rescuers have sent milk and water to the workers through the pipeline, he said.

"The workers are definitely frightened, but their physical conditions are OK," said the official. "The pipeline is great encouragement for them."

The collapse happened at around 3:20 a.m. Sunday in the tunnel of the railway linking Dali and Lijiang when four workers were working inside.

The rescue headquarters predicted that a 28-meter-long tunnel section collapsed at about 700 meters away from the entrance.

More than 100 workers are digging a tunnel of 1.7 meter high and 1.2 meter wide to rescue the trapped workers.
