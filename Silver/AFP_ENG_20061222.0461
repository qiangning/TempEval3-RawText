Mark Hudson scored the only goal as hosts Crystal Palace ended Sunderland's seven-match unbeaten run with a 1-0 victory in the Championship at Selhurst Park here on Friday.

Defeat left the Black Cats in 11th place but only three points off the play-off places as they seek a return to the Premiership at the first attempt following last season's relegation from English football's top-flight.

Sunderland, managed by former Manchester United and Republic of Ireland captain Roy Keane, had plenty of possession but failed to take their chances and Hudson's half-volley strike four minutes before half-time saw Palace take all three points.

Victory saw the Londoners climb further away from danger, the Eagles now nine points clear of the relegation zone ahead of Saturday's matches.
