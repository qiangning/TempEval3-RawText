Health statistics in Zambia indicate that diarrhea and other water- related diseases are ranked among the top common causes of outpatient care for all age groups because of poor hygiene and sanitation. During the first phase of the program (2006-2010), 2.1 million will be provided access to safe water and 2.3 million people to improved sanitation services," ADF, the soft loan arm of the African Development Bank (AfDB) said in a statement.

Since AfDB started working in Zambia in 1971, it has financed 11 operations in water supply and sanitation sector with a combined worth of 137.6 million dollars.
