China's new crackdown on drugs has confirmed how narcotics abuse has spread rapidly across the country, snaring the young and fanning violent crime and the spread of AIDS, press reports said Thursday.

While public security authorities have hailed the success of the campaign launched this month, the predominant feeling is one of concern at the extent of drug trafficking and abuse.

"The situation ahead of us is extremely serious," Public Security Minister Tao Siju was quoted as saying in the latest edition of the bi-monthly magazine, Democracy and the Legal System.

Pointing to a sharp increase in drug trafficking cases last year, Tao warned that the smuggling gangs were becoming "increasingly sophisticated, well organised and armed."

China currently has some 520,000 registered drug addicts, but even Tao admitted that the figure was nowhere near the actual number.

"Drugs are not only a threat to public security, but also to society as a whole," Tao said, pointing out that between 60 and 70 percent of HIV carriers in China had contracted the virus from sharing needles.

Meanwhile, a report carried by the Xinhua news agency on Thursday demonstrated the pandemic nature of China's drug problem, which only five years ago was almost exclusively restricted to the southwestern province of Yunnan, bordering the heroin-producing Golden Triangle region.

On April 15, a major trans-provincial drug-trafficking cartel was broken up in the the new western municipality of Chongqing, with six suspects arrested and 3.33 kilograms (7.3 pounds) of heroin seized.

The ongoing campaign also resulted in the arrest of all members of an 11-strong trafficking gang in Beijing, together with 5.8 kilograms (12.76 pounds) of heroin.

In the northern province of Shanxi, one of China's most-wanted drug traffickers was arrested on April 1 in the city of Datong after eight years on the run.

Police said 50 drug-related crimes had been uncovered this month in Datong alone, resulting in the arrest of 64 suspects.

In Yunnan, some 588 kilograms (1,295 pounds) of heroin were seized in the first three months of this year.

Xinhua also carried a statement from the Public Security Ministry confirming the arrival of the Western designer drug, Ecstasy, which is known here as the "rocking head pill."

"It is dangerous to health and harmful to social stability," it said, adding that the drug had surfaced in major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang and Shenzhen.

In Shanghai on Tuesday, police arrested five drug traffickers and confiscated a total of 6.3 kilograms (13.86 pounds) of heroin and 60,000 yuan (7,200 dollars) in cash.

The current anti-drug campaign is slated to last until the end of September.

The China Youth Daily on Thursday said the rise in drug abuse was especially serious among teenagers, and warned that not nearly enough was being done in schools to educate young people about the dangers of narcotics.

"Schools only seem to act once their students are found to be taking drugs, whereas they should be looking to take more preventative measures," the newspaper said.

According to the report, 46 percent of the drug addicts uncovered last year in the southern city of Guangzhou were less than 18 years old.

"Surveys in schools have shown that many students would be willing to experiment with drugs out of curiosity," it added.
