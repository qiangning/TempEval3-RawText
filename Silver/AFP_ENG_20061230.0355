Under-fire Rangers manager Paul Le Guen says he would rather take the flak for the Ibrox side's dreadful run of form instead of his players.

The Frenchman's team followed up their shock 2-1 loss away to Inverness Caledonian Thistle last Wednesday with a lame 1-1 draw at home to St Mirren on Saturday.

These results enabled Celtic to stretch their advantage over Rangers to 17 points - who are one behind second placed Aberdeen - despite drawing their last two games against Dundee United and Motherwell.

And the Rangers fans made their feelings known at the end of the St Mirren game by booing their side off the pitch.

However, Le Guen has called on the Gers support to direct their displeasure at him while giving their support to the players.

The former Lyon manager said: "There was too much pressure on the players on Saturday after the Inverness game and you could see it affected some of them against St Mirren.

"I feel the pressure and I'm aware of it but I'm ready to take the criticism as I know our results are not good enough.

"I would prefer the pressure to be on me rather than on the players.

"Of course there are problems as we are so far behind in the league but I can cope with the criticism."

On Tuesday Rangers will play away to Motherwell, who drew at home to Celtic on Saturday after Darren Lee Smith cancelled out Derek Riordan's first goal for the Parkhead club, and Le Guen acknowledged his side would find it hard.

He said: "Any game is hard for us now the way we are playing so we know it will be difficult.

"Motherwell had a good result against Celtic and played very well but each point is important for us and we will be trying our best to get a victory."

Rangers' Croatian striker Dado Prso was missing from the Inverness and St Mirren games due to a groin injury but Le Guen is hopeful he will be fit to face Motherwell.

He said: "I hope Dado will be back. He was an important player for us in our victories over Hibs and Aberdeen, and in the draw against Celtic, so it would be useful to have him available."

In Saturday's game Rangers fell behind to St Mirren in the 14th minute after Richard Brittain's first-time strike from 22-yards rocketed past Allan McGregor into the roof of the net.

But five minutes later Rangers were back on level terms when Charlie Adam's corner was headed home by Kris Boyd from six-yards out.

Earlier in the day Celtic had drew 1-1 at Motherwell and the home side's manager Maurice Malpas believed his team should have won.

"My players were magnificent today," Malpas told Setanta Sports 1.

"I was delighted. We told them before the game that they had to get the ball and do something with it.

"I think at the end we deserved the goal. I'll be greedy and say we should have got the win."

Despite the draw Celtic still managed to stretch their lead at the top of the SPL to 16 points over Aberdeen, who lost 3-1 away to Dundee United, and 17 over Rangers.

And they will be further boosted by the news new signing Steven Pressley is set to make his debut on January 2 in the home match against Kilmarnock.

Celtic manager Gordon Strachan confirmed: "He's got a good chance. We'll try to cram in a month's training on Sunday."
