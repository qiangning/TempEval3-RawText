Spain's prime minister Friday confidently predicted an improvement during the coming year in the country's troubled Basque region following a start to dialogue with the armed separatist group ETA.

"The situation will be better in a year," said Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, reporting that negotiations were proceeding "discreetly," despite the view of critics that the peace process is currently blocked.

ETA declared a permanent ceasefire last March after nearly four decades of bombings and shootings claiming more than 850 lives in pursuit of an independent Basque country.

Despite recent incidents the situation had now improved, Zapatero assured a press conference.

"It's better with a permanent ceasefire than when bombs go off as was happening a year ago," the Socialist prime minister commented.

"It's also better than four or five years ago when we had tragic lethal attacks."

ETA's last killing was in May 2003.

But many observers are sceptical about whether ETA really wants to negotiate an end to violence.

Doubts have been prompted by various developments including an arms theft in neighbouring France for which ETA was held responsible, discovery of an arms cache in the Basque country in northern Spain, and a return to street violence in the province.

Zapatero declined to comment on these developments or to confirm there had been a first official meeting this month between ETA and representatives of Spain's national government.

However, the prime minister said the banned separatist Basque political party Batasuna might be allowed to stand again in the next Basque regional elections if it showed respect for rule of law and distanced itself from violence.

Spain's main political opposition, the right-wing Popular Party, takes a harder line, saying Batasuna, seen as the political wing of ETA, should not be allowed to stand in local and regional elections until it expressly renounces violence.
