Visiting Portugal's President Anibal Cavaco Silva said on Tuesday that the excellent Portugal-Brazil relations will continue through the second administration of Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

Cavoco Silva said the two countries' entrepreneurs are in very close contact and mutual investments have been growing.

"Entrepreneurs from Brazil see Portugal not only as a 10-million-inhabitant country, but also a country that takes part in the European Union (EU), which has over 500 million consumers with high purchasing power," he said.

Cavaco Silva made the remarks in Brazilian city Sao Paulo after he attended the 16th Ibero-American Summit in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo.

He noted that the relations between the EU and the South American Common Market (Mercosur) was one of the most frequently raised topics at the summit, and he had promised to try to unblock the free trade agreement between the two groups when Portugal takes over EU Presidency in the second half of 2007.

"We count on Brazil because it can help overcome difficulties that exist in the relationship between Mercosur and Europe," Cavaco Silva added.
