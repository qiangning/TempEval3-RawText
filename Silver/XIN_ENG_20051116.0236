China were held to a goalless draw with East European side Bulgaria in an international soccer friendly here on Wednesday.

China boss Zhu Guanghu's wish of ending the winless record against European teams failed again due to the weaknesses in both the midfield and the forward line in a match lacking excitement.

"As you see I have sent several young players in this match for the sake of preparing for 2008 Olympics and they did a good job," said Zhu after the match.

"It's really a problem that we haven't scored in five matches against European sides. We packed the backline and gave them big pressure, but was not good when we got the ball and began the counter attack. That's what we have to solve."

China dominated the first half in front of a slack Bulgaria squad made up of second-thought players chosen by 1994 World Cup hero Dimitar Penev, packing the guest's half with short passes and long range drives.

After several long range efforts from Cao Yang, Chen Tao and Sun Xiang, midfielder Wang Liang created the best chance for the hosts before the interval with a superb 25m curve after rounding down a defender, which was merely tipped over by a full-stretched Zdravko Zdravkov.

Skipper Li Weifeng went close on 87 minutes to head wide a Wang Liang's fine corner, which was the only highlight of the second half.

"It's a good match anyway. The significance for both teams is not about which one beats the other, but as an exercise for the 2010 World Cup as we both failed to qualify for 2006," commented Penev.

China had suffered four consecutive defeats against European teams like Spain, Ireland, Germany and Serbia and Montenegro this year before this match without scoring a goal.
