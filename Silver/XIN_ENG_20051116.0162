Tennis fans that purchased tickets for this week's Tennis Masters Cup will be given the option to buy tickets for the 2006 event at a discounted rate, said Wednesday the organizers.

It's announced in a statement released by the organizing committee that the price will be 40% off on tickets for next year's championship at the Qi Zhong Stadium, which was carried out as a compensation for fans after big names withdrew from the ATP year-ending tournament.

The organizers also confirmed that ticket prices in 2006 will remain the same as 2005.

Replacement tickets will only be in the same section of the stadium as the original ticket. Tennis fans are advised to retain their ticket stubs as proof of purchase. Any application for a discounted ticket without the ticket stub will not be honored.

Wang Liqun, deputy director for the event jointly held by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the world governing body, and the ATP, had promised Tuesday that tennis fans will be compensated for the withdrawals and absentees of tennis masters.

"Fans who have already bought tickets for this tournament will be able to enjoy a discount next year in the Tennis Masters Cup with no price raising," said Wang.

By the same token, the ATP has also promised that in the next three to six months, some of the top-notch or first-class tennis players will come to Shanghai to meet fans and endorsers.

The Masters Cup, which is always at risk of absenteeism as it comes at the end of the season, has been without five of the world's leading six players after only the second day.

World No. 2 Rafael Nadal Monday announced his pulling out with a left foot injury before his Masters debut even started, and minutes later Andre Agassi further long line of withdrawals at the ATP season-ending event, blaming a bad ankle sprain sustained playing racquetball.

The loss, having severely diminished the tournament's status as the showcase for the finest talent in the men's game, had seen third-ranked Andy Roddick pulling out before the tournament with a back problem and Australian Open winner Marat Safin with a knee injury.

Lleyton Hewitt, ranked fourth, remained in Sydney with his wife, actress Rebecca Cartwright, who is expecting the couple's first child within two weeks.

Top-ranked Roger Federer was left the only top-five player in the elite field, but the two-time defending champion might not go the distance with a sore right ankle.

"We certainly feel regret, and the regret actually comes from not only the fans, but the organizing committee and also the ATP," said another deputy director of the tournament Qin Weichang Tuesday evening.

As an immediate action from the organizers for apologizing to fans, Nadal went on court Monday night between matches and to the media center to say sorry for his withdrawal. Also the 19-year-old Spaniard spared 40 minutes Tuesday afternoon to meet with his fans, which drew about 500 to attend.
