Forty-two pupils from a rural primary school and a pre-school boy in south China are recovering after suffering food poisoning caused by wild fruit, said a hospital source on Tuesday.

The local government said the children in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region suffered nausea and dizziness after eating the fruit on Monday afternoon and all were taken to hospital.

All children are from Shuichong Primary School in Hepu County's Shankou Township and the younger boy was in a safe condition on Tuesday.

Test results showed they were poisoned by the fruit of the jatropha curcal, a shrub that is used to produce biological diesel oil and mainly distributed in south China.

The fruit of the plant is poisonous and can cause dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea or shock.

An emergency safety campaign was launched by all primary and middle schools in the county to avoid a recurrence of such incidents, said Wang Yi, deputy head of the county.
