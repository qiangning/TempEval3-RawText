Rates on 30-year mortgages in the United States increased this week to the highest level in more than two years, mortgage company Freddie Mac reported Thursday in its weekly nationwide survey.

In the week ending Nov. 10, rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.36 percent, up from 6.31 percent last week, the survey showed. That was the highest level since 30-year mortgages were at 6.44 percent in early September 2003.

This week's rates on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages, a popular choice for refinancing a home mortgage, averaged 5.89 percent, up from 5.85 percent last week.

The survey also found that rates on one-year adjustable rate mortgages(ARMs) rose to 5.12 percent this week from 5.09 percent last week. Rates on five-year hybrid adjustable rate mortgages nudged up to 5.81 percent from 5.76 percent.

A year ago, 30-year mortgages averaged 5.76 percent, 15-year mortgages were at 5.16 percent and one-year ARMs averaged 4.16 percent. Freddie Mac began tracking on the five-year ARMs this year.

The increases in mortgage rates this week came as financial markets grew more concerned about inflation, according to analysts.

"News that wages grew faster than had been expected in October reinforced fears of inflation in the financial markets and that bumped up interest rates again this week," Freddie Mac's chief economist Frank Nothaft said.
