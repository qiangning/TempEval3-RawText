The UN Security Council adopted a presidential statement Thursday that welcomed peace efforts between the Ugandan government and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) with an aim to end the long-running conflict in northern Uganda.

The statement called for peace and security to be restored and the rule of law re-established in the areas affected by the fighting and that "those responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are brought to justice."

It welcomed the ongoing peace talks between the Ugandan government and the LRA, which have fought a brutal civil war for 20 years, urging the rebel group to immediately release all women, children and other non-combatants that it holds.

In the statement read out by council President Jorge Voto- Bernales of Peru, the council also welcomed the renewal early this month of the cessation of hostilities agreement struck between the two sides in August and pledged to continue to monitor developments closely.

Council members praised the Ugandan government for setting up a committee to monitor efforts to relieve humanitarian problems in northern Uganda and also its work so far on a peace, recovery and development plan that aims to tackle longer-term issues.

The council "looks forward to further progress on improving the living conditions for civilians in northern Uganda, measurable against clear benchmarks, and urges member states to maintain their support to these efforts."

Talks are taking place in Juba, southern Sudan, between the government of Uganda and the LRA, in a bid to reach a comprehensive peace agreement to end a conflict that has caused the death, abduction or forced displacement of 2 million people across northern Uganda and southern Sudan - as well as the killings of eight UN peacekeepers in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo.
