The US State Department has advised its embassies to review their security measures in the wake of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's execution, a spokeswoman said Saturday.

"We did send a cable to all of our diplomatic missions simply asking them to look at their security stance in light of the execution," a State Department spokeswoman told AFP on condition of anonymity.

She said the message did not call for any "specific steps," noting that each embassy has its own set of security procedures.

Asked whether any threat precipitated the release of the message, the spokeswoman said she was not aware of any such danger.

Saddam was hanged for crimes against humanity for the execution of 148 Shiite civilians following an attempt on the then president's life in the town of Dujail, north of Baghdad, in the early 1980s.

Dozens of Iraqis were killed and dozens more wounded in a series of bloody car bombings that caused chaos after the government's pre-dawn execution of the ousted dictator on Saturday.
