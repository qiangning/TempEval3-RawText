About 1,000 Buddhists held a religious ceremony on Thursday in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, to see off the holy Buddha Finger Sarira, which is heading for the Republic of Korea (ROK) for one month of enshrinement there.

The ceremony was chaired by Master Monk Yi Cheng, president of the Buddhist Association of China, and Master Monk Sheng Hui, who is in charge of the escort, at Famen Temple of Xi'an, one of the four sacred places in Chinese Buddhism.

The Buddhists, from both China and the ROK, saluted the images of Buddha and chanted aloud sutras from Buddhist classics at the ceremony.

The Buddha Finger Sarira, or the finger bone relic of Buddhism founder Sakyamuni, is regarded as China's state treasure. It is going to the ROK at the invitation of the ROK Buddhist Association.

This is an important event in the 1,600-year history of friendly relations between the two countries, said Master Monk Sheng Hui.

The enshrinement of the Buddha Finger Sarira in the ROK could bring the ROK people happiness, improve social morality and boost friendship between the two countries, said Hui Cong, head of the inviting Buddhist delegation from the ROK.

The Buddha Finger Sarira will stay in the ROK from Nov. 11 to Dec. 20.

Since it was unearthed from a secret chamber at the Famen Temple in 1987 after being buried underground for nearly 1,000 years, the Buddha Finger Sarira has been sent to Thailand and China's Taiwan Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for enshrinement. The three activities, arranged respectively in 1994, 2002 and 2004, attracted millions of Buddhist believers.
