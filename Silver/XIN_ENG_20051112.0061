An insurgent sniper hunted two US soldiers in the flashpoint city of Fallujah, west of Baghdad, on Saturday, a witness said.

"A sniper opened fire at a US military patrol in Souq al-Qadiem district, and picked off two soldiers before he fled the scene," Abdul-Rahman told Xinhua.

"Another insurgent hurled a grenade at a US patrol in the city damaging a US Humvee, but it was not known whether there was any casualty," he said.

US troops returned fire and cordoned off the area and searched for the attackers, he added.

Fallujah, some 50 km west of Baghdad in the restive Anbar province, has witnessed frequent attacks against US and Iraqi forces.
