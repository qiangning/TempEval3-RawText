White mice will be used to test the safety of food prepared for 2008 Olympic Games athletes, say Beijing officials.

Milk, alcohol, salad, rice, oil, salt and seasonings will be tested by white mice 24 hours before being used in cooking or served to athletes, said Zhao Xinsheng with the Beijing Municipal Health Inspection Bureau.

He told a meeting that mice would develop adverse reactions to poisoning within 17 hours, quicker than test methods like bacterial cultures.

Most food for athletes would be Western style, complemented by Chinese dishes, said Zhen Xiaozhen, from the Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games medical team, at the meeting on Olympics hygiene safety.

Zhao said all the food would be securely stored, and all food arriving at the Olympic restaurants would be recorded by control headquarters.

Moreover, food deliveries would be vetted by public security personnel and quarantine departments and transported by special vehicles and staff.

The vehicles would be equipped with global positioning systems and food packages would be secured during transport, said an official with the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau.

Food storage areas would be fitted with alarms, video cameras and fire controls, and kitchens guarded around the clock.

Starting this month, health inspectors would receive training in Western food management and inspection techniques, said Liang Jin with the inspection bureau.

To ensure food safety, experts also suggested eliminating some foods from the menu for Olympic athletes to avoid doping problems.

Yang Shumin of the China Doping Control Center said that Olympic restaurants should not serve food such as animal livers because they might contain traces of drugs or additives consumed by the animal.

Nowadays lots of fowl and livestock are fed with additives that contain blacklisted hormones, he said, noting that athletes who accidentally ate this kind of food might test positive in anti-doping urine tests.

The organizing committee should set strict standards for food suppliers regarding feed for fowls and livestock, banning them from using any additives which could cause doping problems, Yang told a meeting on Olympic food safety in July.
