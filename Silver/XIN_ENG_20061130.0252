China's Ministry of Commerce issued a bulletin on Thursday to launch a mid-term examination of measures against dumping by a petro-chemical company in the Republic of Korea (ROK).

The examination into the alleged dumping of styrene butadiene rubber was scheduled to end within a year, according to the ministry.

ROK-based Kumbo Petrochemical Co., Ltd. submitted an application to the ministry in September for a mid-term examination, asking China to lower its 10 percent tariff rate.

Styrene butadiene rubber is a chemical material used in the manufacture of tires and other rubber products. China levied an anti-dumping tax on imported rubber from Russia, the ROK and Japan in September 2003.
