Iraqis turned out in droves Thursday in a landmark poll to choose a new government many hope will restore stability to a nation wracked by violence and sectarian feuding since the fall of Saddam Hussein.

Despite a massive security lockdown, two men were killed in attacks in northern Iraq while mortar strikes in Baghdad, including one in the heavily fortified Green Zone claimed by an Al-Qaeda-linked group, injured four civilians and a US marine.

"The most important thing is for Iraqis to express themselves with ballots, not blasts," said Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari.

Turnout quickened throughout the day, with voting strong in the Shiite south and in Sunni Arab districts where people queued up to cast their ballots, in stark contrast to their overwhelming boycott of an election in January.

Strict security measures brought Iraq to a halt as 15.5 million Iraqis were called to vote for a four-year, 275-member parliament, with top candidates pledging to restore stability and pave the way for an exit of foreign troops.

"It's a national celebration for all Iraqis," said President Jalal Talabani, the country's first Kurdish head of state.

US President George W. Bush, whose approval ratings slumped over the mounting US death toll in Iraq, said Iraqi democracy would serve as a "model" for the Middle East.

The vote, the third this year, marks a new beginning following the US-led invasion in March 2003 to oust Saddam, two transitional governments and the adoption of a constitution in October.

Iraqis poured into the streets and walked to polling stations because of a vehicle ban aimed at curbing car bomb attacks.

In the capital and in the restive Sunni city of Fallujah, disabled men in wheelchairs and on crutches joined neighbours to cast their ballots, with many demanding stability and the restoration of public services such as electricity and water.

In the holy city of Najaf, as well as the main southern city of Basra, residents were already celebrating the victory of the main religious Shiite United Iraqi Alliance coalition.

A total of 7,655 candidates and 307 political entities, nearly triple the number that stood in January, are running, with turnout among the ousted Sunni minority expected to be much higher this time.

"The next parliament will represent all Iraqis," said Vice President Abdel Abdel Mehdi, tipped by many as the next prime minister.

Ministers praised the security operation intended to prevent the suicide attacks that killed almost 40 people during January's election, the first free vote in Iraq in half a century.

"The security situation in most of the provinces is good, if not to say excellent," announced Interior Minister Bayan Jabr Solagh.

The leading secular Shiite candidate, former prime minister Iyad Allawi, complained however that his supporters had been attacked and killed during the campaign.

A top British general said the election gave London "growing confidence" that a transition of security powers, allowing foreign troops to leave Iraq, would begin in the first half of 2006.

"We ought to be just grateful that today is going so well and will bring us that much nearer to the day that the job gets done and we can come home," General Nick Houghton told the BBC.

Roughly 2,150 US soldiers have been killed since the 2003 invasion, which Bush admitted Wednesday had been based on wrong intelligence. An estimated 30,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed.

Suicide attacks, shootings and kidnapping have become standard fare in a deadly insurgency driven by Sunni Arab nationalism and Al-Qaeda extremists.

Adjourned for the election, Saddam's trial on charges of crimes against humanity threatened to exacerbate already high ethnic tensions in the country.

Following purported Al-Qaeda threats to "ruin the 'democratic' wedding", virtually all Iraq's 190,000 police and army were mobilized, with US-led troops providing perimeter security for voting stations.

Civilians were banned from carrying weapons and driving to polling stations that opened at 7:00 am (0400 GMT) and were to close at 5:00 pm.

Shiites and Kurds who dominated the transitional administration, are looking to a full-term parliament as a chance to cement their grip on power after decades of oppression.

The Sunni minority is keen to prevent a government dominated by religious Shiites and a break-up of Iraq into autonomous Kurdish and Shiite zones.

"The Shiites have more seats than they deserve and because of this there has been state terrorism and killings," charged Mekky Latif, an election observer in Fallujah.

The first task of the new parliament will be to appoint a president and two vice presidents. The presidential council will then have 15 days to name a prime minister, who has 30 days to form a cabinet with parliamentary approval.

On Tuesday, US Senator Richard Lugar warned however that an operational government might not be finalised until April.
