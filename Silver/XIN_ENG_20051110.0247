French Minister for Foreign Trade Christine Lagardo is due in Kenya on Friday for a two-day visit to discuss trade and development issues, officials disclosed here Thursday.

During her visit to Kenya, which comes just six weeks before the World Trade Organization's (WTO) ministerial conference to be held in Hong Kong in December, Lagardo will emphasize the key priorities that France attaches to the development aspect of the global trade negotiations, said a statement from the French Embassy in Nairobi.

"Lagardo will discuss trade and development issues. She will also stress the important priority that France attaches to the development aspect of the WTO negotiations and especially the issues of access to medicines in African countries," the statement said.

The French minister, who arrives from west Africa where she visited Benin and Nigeria, will hold talks with Kenyan authorities and the relevant stakeholders as well as representatives of the private sector and nongovernmental organizations.

She is also expected to visit a factory producing generic drugs in Nairobi, as well as a coffee firm in the outskirts of the Kenyan capital.

The WTO talks in Hong Kong are part of the four-year-old Doha Round talks which aims to expand free trade in a way that benefits poor countries.

African nations have remained adamant that no deals would be struck on the agricultural fronts during the talks because of the huge agricultural subsidies given by the United States and the European Union.
