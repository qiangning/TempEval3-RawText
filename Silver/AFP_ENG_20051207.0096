Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao was due to tour a hi-tech satellite facility Wednesday as he wraps up a four-day visit to France, during which he has secured a huge Airbus plane deal and stressed his country's nuclear energy ambitions.

The focus of his trip has been clearly strategic business-making, shown by his involvement in a contract Monday to purchase 150 mid-range Airbus planes worth nearly an estimated 10 billion dollars (8.3 billion euros).

On Tuesday, he inspected a site in southern France that is to host a future experimental nuclear reactor which China is participating in.

On Wednesday, he was to tour a satellite facility in Cannes, on the French Riviera, belonging to Alcatel. One of several deals he signed Monday in Paris was for the French firm to make a Chinasat 6B telecommunications satellite.

Wen was to continue his European tour by flying to Slovakia later Wednesday before he heads to the Czech Republic and Portugal.

The biggest announcement by far during his stay in France was the Airbus order for jets from its single-aisle A320 family -- the largest contract ever received by the European plane-maker, which is fighting US rival Boeing for Chinese market share.

In an indication of the deal's importance, Wen began his trip by visiting the headquarters of the European plane-maker in France's southwestern city of Toulouse on Sunday.

There, he highlighted China's goal to master its own economic development by having a memorandum signed that commits Airbus to exploring the feasibility of building an aircraft assembly plant in China.

With Western companies seriously courting China -- which boasts a burgeoning economy and a population of 1.3 billion people -- Wen and his government are ensuring that any big deals come with strings attached, namely the transfer of knowhow and technology so China can be a heavy manufacturing powerhouse of the future.

Experts say the transfer of technology is often a clincher in negotiations.

That interest in technology was also at the forefront of Wen's visit to the site of the planned International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in southern France.

"The energy issue elicits great attention in the whole world, and the ITER site also attracts great attention in the world," Wen said at Cadarache, north of Marseille.

Nuclear energy is seen as a key component behind China's economic expansion, filling a demand created by the multiplication of Chinese industries.

Although ITER is a joint research project by the European Union, Japan, the United States, China, Russia, South Korea and India and will not be operational for another decade, Beijing is seeking to extend its current nuclear energy programme.

To that end, Wen told his French hosts Tuesday that more effort was needed if they wanted to win an eight-billion-dollar (6.8-billion-euro) tender to construct four third-generation nuclear energy reactors in China.

"China hopes that France will offer more attractive conditions on technology transfer as well as price so that Franco-Chinese cooperation in this field can develop," he said just before visiting the ITER site.

French company Areva is vying for that contract but faces stiff competition from Westinghouse of the United States and Russia's AtomStroyExport.
