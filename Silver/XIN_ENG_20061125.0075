China ushered candidates into examination rooms on Saturday as the national civil servant recruitment examination got underway, with on average 42 people competing for each government job in 2007.

The exam is held simultaneously in 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions nationwide where more than 530,000 people will compete for about 12,700 jobs, said a spokesman of the Ministry of Personnel, the exam organizer.

The ministry said the administrative aptitude test (AAT) in the morning is followed by an essay test in the afternoon.

Nationwide, north China's Liaoning Province has about 18,000 exam takers, the coastal province of Jiangsu registered 30,000, while the northwestern province of Shaanxi and the southern province of Guangdong have each enrolled about 40,000 people for the exam.

Since 1994, China has organized 13 consecutive civil servant recruitment examinations for central and regional government bodies.

Statistics show 4.13 million college students graduated this year, three quarters of a million more than last year. The number of college graduates in 2007 will be close to 5 million.

"The examination is popular because it provides a level playing field for those competing to become civil servants," said Vice Minister of Personnel Yin Weimin.

He said the examination's popularity is also due to the prestige of civil servants and increasing competition on the job market.
