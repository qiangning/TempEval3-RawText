The economic climate in Greece has returned to a growth course similar to that of the EU-25, while the Greek economy significantly reduced a "shortfall of optimism" that prevailed after the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, a report said.

Economic growth is expected to exceed 3.4 percent this year, boosted by domestic demand and rising investments, said the report issued on Thursday by the Institute for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE).

It attributed the rising consumption to an expanding consumer credit and stressed that the increasing investments reflected an improving business climate and a recovery in public investments. The economic sentiment index kept rising for the last 12 months.

Consumers, however, remained gloomy over economic developments, the report said. The consumer sentiment index was the third lowest in the EU-25 and the lowest in the Eurozone, a trend prevailing for the last 15 years even in rapid growth periods for the Greek economy.

It underlined a systematic difference between real economic development and how consumers viewed them, the IOBE report said.

The report also blamed the out-of-date laws and regulations, and as for the new legislative initiative, it remained uncontrolled as far as its impact on the economy was concerned.

The report said spending on the country's social insurance system would grow rapidly in the future, warning that if the problem was not timely dealt with, it could undermine efforts for a sustainable reduction of public spending.
