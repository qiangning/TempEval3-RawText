Israeli President Moshe Katsav said on Saturday that the upcoming general elections due in March will be a true referendum on Israel's political path.

"This time, it is the true referendum," Katsav said in an interview with Israel Radio. "We must reach a decision in the debate that has been going on for 38 years since the Six-Day War."

"The parties must present the voters with clear, responsible positions on all the issues that are on the balance, including the state's permanent borders," Katsav added.

Meanwhile, Vice Premier Shimon Peres on Saturday confirmed reports that he was approached by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's new party, and said he would decide whether to join it in the coming days.

"The only thing before my eyes is the country's interest, and the chances to bring about peace," Peres told Israel Radio. " There are no personal considerations in my decision."

The 82-year-old politician said he would make a final decision on the matter in the coming days.

Sharon officially asked Katsav to dissolve parliament on Monday. After quitting the center-right Likud party he co-founded decades ago, Sharon announced the formation of a new centrist party named Kadima (Forward).

President Katsav has issued a decree to call a snap election, scheduled for March 28, which is widely expected to reshape Israel 's political landscape.

Prospects of reviving long-stalled peace talks with the Palestinians, economy and social welfare are to be in the heart of the March ballot, said analysts.
