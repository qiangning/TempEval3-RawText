The Chinese government is taking effective measures to ensure the safety of foreigners and foreign organizations in China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a regular press conference here Tuesday.

Liu was commenting on a warning on the US embassy website that it had received credible information that a terrorist threat may exist against official US government facilities in Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong province.

"China's public security departments organized a meeting as soon as it received the message from the US embassy." Liu said, adding that China is taking the report seriously and will respond responsibly.

The US embassy published the warning on its website on November 13. The website also indicated that the threat may also exist for places where Americans are known to congregate or visit, including clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools or outdoor recreation events.

Liu emphasized that the Chinese government always attaches great importance to the safety of foreign nationals and organizations in China.

"The Chinese government has taken effective measures and will continue such efforts to guarantee personal safety of foreign citizens here." Liu said, "I believe that with these measures and increased awareness of self protection, foreign citizens will continue to enjoy living, working, traveling and studying in China."
