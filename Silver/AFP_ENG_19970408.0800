Expert-level delegations from China and Vietnam started discussions early Wednesday on a territorial dispute in the oil-rich South China Sea.

Held at the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, the talks are aimed at solving a potentially troublesome dispute over waters contested between Beijing and Hanoi.

They were arranged at Vietnam's request after the China National Offshore Oil Corp. deployed an exploratory oil rig in the disputed area on March 7.

The Kantan III rig was finally withdrawn on April 1.

The disputed zone lies south of the Gulf of Tonkin, almost equidistant from the central-Vietnamese coast and the Chinese island of Hainan. The area is believed to be rich in natural gas.

It is not covered by regular bilateral talks on contested areas in the South China Sea.

China and Vietnam have twice run into territorial disputes in the South China Sea, first in 1974 over the Paracel islands and again in 1988 over the Spratly Islands.
