Japan's ace Miki Ando has vowed to bounce back for a qualification for the Olympics after her disastrous performance at the Grand Prix series NHK Trophy figure skating competition here.

The 17-year-old Ando, the only female skater to have performed a quadruple in competition at the 2004 world junior championships, fell twice in her free skating to finish fourth Saturday.

Ando was behind fellow Japanese Yukari Nakano, who captured her first Grand Prix win, and Fumie Suguri, the runner-up.

But Ando, as well as Nakano, earned a place in the Grand Prix Final later this month in Tokyo and she is likely to be chosen for the Olympics by the Japan Skating Federation if she finishes among the top three.

Japan has three tickets in the women's competition for the Olympics.

Mao Asada also reached the elite six-women Grand Prix Final with her victory at Paris and runner-up finish at Beijing, but at age 15 she is ineligible for the Olympics.

"I'm really glad that I reached the Grand Prix Final, because I thought I failed to qualify. It's wonderful that three of us from Japan qualified for the Final," said Ando, who will be 18 on the last day of the GP Final.

"I really want to take part in the Olympics. Until last season, I felt just happy whenever I skated my own performance, but now I feel like I cannot win unless I try to win. I want to smile on the podium next time."

Nakano, a 20-year-old from Tokyo, said she was surprised with her first victory as well as a place in the Grand Prix Final despite a fall at landing a triple axel in the free skating.

"I'm not going to think about the Olympics, because I'm sure I will be under heavy pressure if I think about it. It is important to always perform solid and try to do as well as I usually do in practice," Nakano said.

Suguri, who was fifth in the Salt Lake City Olympics, the 2004 world champion Shizuka Arakawa and Yoshie Onda have to wait until the national championships for their chances to qualify for Torino.

"I feel as if it has cast a gleam of hope upon my way towards the Olympics," said two-time world bronze medallist Suguri, 24, who put an end to her injury-affected season with the runner-up finish in Osaka.

"I'm not in good form physically, so I just tried to do what I was able to do at this moment," she added. "When I think about how far I've completed my programme, it's less than 80 percent."
