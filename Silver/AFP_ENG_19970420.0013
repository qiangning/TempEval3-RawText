More than 2,000 Chinese armed police and soldiers have taken over a town in southern China after a revolt there against plans to switch it to another municipality, reports here said Sunday.

The armed police surrounded the town of Wuyin, in southern Guangdong province, Saturday after townsfolk injured and threw out members of an official working group sent in to solve the long-running row over the boundary change.

The villagers, mainly ethnic Chiu Chow, are angered by the plan to switch jurisdiction of Wuying to Kaxi municipality, mainly peopled by another Chinese minority group, the Hakka, according to a report in the China-backed Wen wei Po published here.

Around 10,000 people in Wuyin turned out for a protest recently, calling on the authorities to allow them to remain within the boundaries of Luhe municipality.

The argument has been raging since 1960 when the authorities first mooted the idea of change the jurisdiction of Wuyin which has rich natural resources.

A similar confrontation happened in 1991, but no-one was injured.

The Kaxi area is poorer and the Hakka people are considered China's gypsies.

According to the Oriental Daily News on Sunday, 86 percent of people in Wuyin oppose the proposed boundary change.
