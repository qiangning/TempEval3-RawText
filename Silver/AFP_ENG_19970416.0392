A four-storey building under construction in the Senegalese capital Dakar collapsed, killing two workers and injuring three others, hospital sources said Wednesday.

Tuesday's accident came just a week after two old buildings tumbled down in Dakar and the northern town of Saint-Louis, killing two other people.

Technicians at the ministry of planning said that the building had collapsed on Tuesday because workers had failed to observe construction regulations.

After the previous accidents, the local press blamed greedy proprietors for erecting buildings with the sole aim of cutting costs at the expense of safety.
