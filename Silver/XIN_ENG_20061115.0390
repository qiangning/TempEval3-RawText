A series of firebomb attacks targeting banks in Athens occurred Wednesday overnight, days before the 33rd anniversary of the Polytechnic students' uprising in 1973.

The first firebomb attack, which targeted a National Bank branch in the Peristeri district, damaged an ATM and the bank's entrance. A few minutes later, the entrance of another National Bank branch in Paleo Faliro was also wrecked by fire.

In Holargos district, a firebomb caused minor damage to a third National Bank branch.

Extensive damages were also reported following a firebomb raid against an Emporiki Bank branch in downtown Athens.

The 1973 uprising was an event marred by violence of self-styled anarchist and anti-state youths and activists.
