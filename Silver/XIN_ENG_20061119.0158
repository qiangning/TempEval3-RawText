UN peacekeeping troops in Liberia from Bangladesh called on Liberians over the weekend to mitigate the effects of 14 years of civil war and sustain ongoing initiatives towards achieving self-sufficiency in food production.

"Liberians must move towards a brighter future of self- dependence," Col. Abdul Haque, commander of the 10th Battalion of the Bangladeshi peacekeeping troops, told Liberians at the inaugural harvesting of mechanized rice farms in Ganta, a once embattled town in Nimba county, about 300 km north of the Liberian capital Monrovia.

The inaugural harvesting was part of two days of festivities in commemoration of the World Food Day organized by the Liberian government.

Under the slogan "Mechanized Farming is the Key to Agriculture Success," Bangladeshi peacekeepers have been assisting the farmers to start mechanized farming at viable project sites abandoned during the civil crisis. A modest amount of lands have been redeveloped and cultivated for seed rice multiplication by the farmers through the assistance of the peacekeepers who provided tractors, fuel and training.

Liberian Agriculture Minister Chris Toe hailed the peacekeepers' efforts, saying that the initiative would lead the way to food security in the country. He assured, "As the economy improves and with available resources, there would be marked improvement within the agriculture sector within five years."

"Next year we will triple the amount of lands and the government will buy each bag of seed rice that would be produced by the farms," Toe told farmers.

Food insecurity in the country is a challenge the Liberian government is committed to cope with through its own initiatives and with the support from development partners, Toe said.

According to a commerce ministry's estimate, food imports in Liberia account for more than 50 percent, among which rice imports take up over 50 percent.

The World Food Day was set by the United Nations on October 16, but last month's global celebration of the World Food Day was postponed in Liberia by a month to accommodate mass participation.

Officials of the government, nongovernmental organizations and the diplomatic community, as well as Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and UN Special Envoy Alan Doss, gathered in the town of Ganta for the festivities and were impressed by the huge turnout and the variety of produce hundreds of farmers put on display from around country.

Johnson-Sirleaf said to farmers, "Do not see this as a one-day event. See it as a kickoff to continue the work."

In view of the need for smaller countries to gain maximum benefits from increased investment in agriculture, Doss called for a "level playing field" in global trade by appealing to industrialized nations to do away with barrels that hinder fair trade to the disadvantage of smaller nations.
