Everton have decided to file a formal complaint to the Football Association over what they regard as a defamatory attack on striker Andy Johnson by Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.

The Merseyside club have already indicated that they are considering legal action over Mourinho's criticism of Johnson's alleged diving, which he made after Chelsea's 3-2 win at Goodison Park on Sunday.

Mourinho was enraged by an incident in which Johnson jumped over Chelsea goalkeeper Hilario as they both went for the ball and tumbled after landing.

"He's dangerous for the opponents because you cannot trust him," Mourinho said of Johnson.

That infuriated Everton manager David Moyes, who argued that his forward had been taking evasive action to ensure he did not clatter into the goalkeeper.

Everton had called on Mourinho to retract his remarks but the lack of a response from Stamford Bridge prompted them to make things official with spokesman Ian Ross confirming: "We will now make a formal complaint to the FA over Jose Mourinho's remarks regarding Andrew Johnson."

Everton's move means the FA will have to review Mourinho's post-match interviews and decide whether he has a disciplinary case to answer.
