Iraqi Interior Minister Bayan Baqer Sulagh has criticised the training of Iraqi police recruits by German experts in the United Arab Emirates and said they would no longer participate in the programme.

"We aren't convinced by the level of training of the Iraqi police officers by the German experts, nor by their barely seriously manner" the minister said Tuesday during a press conference here, the UAE news agency Wam reported.

Sulagh said he had expressed his dissatisfaction to the German ambassador to the UAE, adding they were seeking "training programmes which were more serious and more effective".

"Iraq now needs men trained with seriousness and intent, because they are engaged in a real confrontation with terrorism," the minister said.

Sulagh said Baghdad "won't be sending any more Iraqis" to the next training programme starting in March.

Germany was opposed to the US and British invasion of Iraq in 2003 and refused to send German troops to the country, even as part of NATO forces.

It did, however, agree to train Iraqi security forces, police and soldiers outside the Iraqi territory.
