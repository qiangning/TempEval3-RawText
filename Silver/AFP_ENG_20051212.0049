FIFA president Sepp Blatter has called for every club to employ at least six players eligible for the national team in the country they ply their trade to curb the invasion of foreigners.

Blatter, in Tokyo for the World Club Championships, said a taskforce was looking at "the national identity of clubs" with many now a cosmopolitan mix of several nationalities, shutting out local players.

"National identity is very important but the regulations of the club competitions are not made so far by FIFA but by the national associations and it is up to them and their leagues to limit the entry of foreign players," he said.

Blatter acknowledged that rules in the European Union allowed for the free circulation of workers among the EU's 25-member nations but said there was a sensible solution.

"What the solution is is that there should be a minimum, and this is FIFA's idea, we should have at least six players eligible for the national team of a the country in which they play," he told reporters.

"This is the system FIFA thinks is right.

"In many clubs there are now only a maximum or one or two players, like Bayern Munich or even Liverpool. This situation is not good for football."
