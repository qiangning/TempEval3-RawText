Four Palestinian militants were killed and five others wounded on Thursday night in two separate airstrikes carried out by Israeli army aircraft in northern Gaza Strip, medics and eyewitnesses reported.

Eyewitnesses said that an Israeli reconnaissance drone fired one missile at a group of Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) militants east of Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza Strip, killing one militant and wounded three others.

Half an hour later, another drone missile was fired at another group of militants in the same area, killing three Palestinian militants and wounded two others, they added.

The latest deaths brought the total number of the Palestinians killed on Thursday to at least nine.

Earlier on Thursday evening, a senior female security officer was killed in the town of Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza Strip by Israeli soldiers' gunfire, said Palestinian security sources.

Mes'eda Hweihi, 40, an officer in the secret intelligence and also a Fatah movement activist, was shot dead as she was trying to help militants who were surrounded by Israeli soldiers into one of the mosques in the town.

On Thursday morning, four Palestinians were killed, three were shot dead by Israeli army snipers, and one 75-year-old man died of fear due to a severe heart attack, said Palestinian medics.

The Israeli army forces stormed early on Wednesday morning the town of Beit Hanoun in a large-scale military operation, the Israeli army had called "the clouds of autumn".

Palestinian security sources said that the Israeli army forces backed by dozens of tanks, bulldozers and armored vehicles covered by helicopters and fighting drones had occupied the whole town.

Palestinian medics said that seven Palestinians were killed on Wednesday, most of them were militants, adding that the death toll since the beginning of the operation hit to 15 killed and more than 100 wounded.

Resident said the Israeli army imposed a curfew on the whole town and ordered every male aged between 16 and 45 to gather into one of the schools in the town.

They added that many of them were interrogated and beaten by the soldiers, while at least 100 people were arrested. "The school turned into a detention camp," said the residents.

The Israeli army said the aim of the operation into northern Gaza Strip is aiming at reining on Palestinian militant groups who are firing homemade rockets round the clock on Israeli communities in southern Israel.

Different militant groups claimed responsibility on Thursday afternoon for launching several homemade rockets at Israel. Three Israelis were injured earlier Thursday by the shrapnel of a homemade rocket fired from Gaza.
