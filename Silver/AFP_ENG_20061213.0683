Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard said on Wednesday they would jointly invest 300 million dollars in a three-year partnership to become the go-to source for business computer systems.

Microsoft software expertise would be combined with HP hardware savvy to tailor networks to meet individual company needs from e-mail and voice mail to video conferencing and infrastructure, executives said at a news briefing.

"It's a perfect time to go to market as one single stack of the best combination of hardware and software available today," said HP senior vice president John McCain. "It is a great opportunity."

Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner said the partnership was aimed at winning a major share of the business network market, which is predicted to exceed 50 billion dollars in 2007.

"We are very excited about this partnership and where we can take it," Turner said. "It is about driving hardware sales and services for HP and selling more Microsoft technology."

The partnership was an extension of a decades-old relationship between Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and California-based HP, according to the executives.

"This builds on 20 years of successful partnering by the companies," said HP executive vice president Ann Livermore. "Our sales forces are ready. We could begin tomorrow."

The alliance announced on Wednesday made HP the first "global partner" in a Microsoft People-Ready Business program that was described as being focused on giving people technology tools needed to excel at their jobs.

"We ought to be able to cover almost the whole world between the resources we have and what Microsoft has," Livermore said.

"In some cases the solution might be a simple server and some software, and in others more complex software. The power is we can come at this from many different standpoints."
