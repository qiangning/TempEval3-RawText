Thierry Henry became the first Gunner to net 100 goals at Highbury when he led Arsenal to a 3-0 win over Blackburn on Saturday.

Arsenal raced to a 1-0 ahead with Cesc Fabregas' shot but Rovers reacted strongly with Craig Bellamy a constant threat.

Henry made it 2-0 just before half-time as Arsenal looked comfortably on top.

Bellamy and David Thompson went close with headers as Rovers refused to give up, before Robin van Persie's stunning late effort wrapped up the points.

Arsenal led after four minutes when Fabregas was left unmarked to curl a low shot into the bottom corner from outside the box.

But any thoughts that this would herald a stroll for Arsenal proved unfounded as Rovers responded positively.

The combination of Shefki Kuqi's physical presence and Morten Gamst Pedersen's deft footwork kept Sol Campbell and Pascal Cygan on their toes.

Rovers' best early chance came when Lucas Neill's long ball bisected Campbell and Kolo Toure, but Bellamy had to stretch just that bit too far and his lob was off target.

In the dying moments of the half Henry created another piece of history, clocking up his Highbury century when he stroked home Pires' through-ball.

Shortly after the restart Kuqi and Steven Reid both went close for Rovers, and Bellamy's header inches wide gave Arsenal another scare.

But just when the home side were starting to worry, substitute Van Persie cut in from the right and produced a sweet shot into the far top corner to settle matters.
