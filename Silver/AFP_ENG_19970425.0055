A former US diplomat was charged Friday with possession of forged instruments after being earlier acquitted of possessing forged passports.

Jerry Wolf Stuchiner, 45, a top immigration official at the US consulate in Honduras was immediately rearrested Friday by anti-graft officers after winning an appeal against his conviction and 40-month jail term for possessing forged passports.

He appeared in court under the new charge but no plea was taken and the case was adjourned until next Tuesday.

Stuchiner was remanded under the custody of the anti-graft body, the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

He was convicted last August of possessing five blank Honduran passports.

In his appeal, lodged last week, he admitted holding the passports but pleaded not guilty because they were blank.

Under Hong Kong immigration law, forged passports must carry a photograph for a crime to be committed.

In handing down the appeal court's decision, Judge Henry Litton said "it is quite clear" that the charge against the defendant was "unsustainable under the law."

Stuchiner's application for the court to pay legal costs was rejected.

Stuchiner was arrested at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport on July 15 last year carrying the passports he allegedly planned to sell to allow people from China, Macau and Taiwan to get into the United States.

He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail on August 16 last year.

Stuchiner was head of the US immigration service in Honduras at the time of his arrest. Before that, he held a similar position at the US consulate in Hong Kong between 1989-1994.

Last month another US diplomat was suspended from work over a case of suspected visa fraud.

James DeBates, 45, acting officer-in-charge of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in Hong Kong, and his wife, Heddy, a US citizen of Chinese origin, were detained for questioning by Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in mid-March.

DeBates was suspended after being released without charge. He claimed diplomatic immunity and his wife was released on bail.
