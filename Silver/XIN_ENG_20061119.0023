Group 20 (G20) finance ministers and central bank governors finished their 8th meeting here Sunday, noting the outlook of the world economy remains positive, while the global economic growth is expected to slow slightly from the rapid pace of the past few years.

Attendants at the two-day meeting, under the theme of "Building and Sustaining Prosperity," discussed world economic conditions, energy security, demographic change, climate change and International Monetary Fund and the World Bank's reforms.

Since above average growth in the global economy has seen spare capacity decline, which has increased the risks to inflation, countries need to continue the normalization of monetary policy, they said in a final communique issued on Sunday.

On energy security, the attendants said global demand for energy and minerals commodities is set to increase significantly over the coming decades driven by a strong world economy, rising incomes, and ongoing industrialization and urbanization in many economies.

"We agreed that enhancing global trade by strengthening markets, and ensuring sustainability by promoting investment and encouraging efficiency, are the best ways to deliver lasting resource security," they said in the communique.

Meanwhile, police numbers doubled at barricades around the meeting venue in case of a possible fresh attack by the protesters Sunday.

On Saturday, 2,000-3,000 protesters held demonstrations against the meeting and clashed with police.

A number of police officers were injured and one of them was taken to hospital with a suspected broken wrist.

The Group 20 is an informal forum which first met in December 1999 following the Asian financial crisis. The group members represent around 85 percent of global gross domestic product, 80 percent of world trade and two-thirds of the world's population.
