A series of climate change meetings opened at the UN Office in Nairobi, Kenya on Monday with participants warning that climate change is fast proving to be one of the greatest challenges in the history of humankind.

Thousands of participants to the meetings, dubbed as "the United Nations Climate Change Conference -- Nairobi 2006", called for collective action to tackle the threat.

"Climate change is rapidly emerging as one of the most serious threats that humanity may ever face," said the newly-elected President of the conference, Kenyan Environment Minister Kivutha Kibwana at the opening ceremony.

The Nov. 6-17 conference, including the 12th Conference of the 189 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2nd meeting of the 166 Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and other side events, is the first UN climate summit held in sub-Saharan Africa.

Kibwana warned that global warming threatened the development goals for billions of the world's poorest people.

"We face a genuine danger that recent gains in poverty reduction will be thrown into reverse in coming decades, particularly for the poorest communities on the continent of Africa," he said.

The conference president went on to say that for these communities, scarce resources that would otherwise be channeled into essential projects to further economic development would instead be used for other emergencies, such as health care crises, water shortages and food stock failures.

He called on parties meeting in Nairobi to work together to ensure that real action is achieved on the issue of adaptation to climate change.

"Past and current greenhouse gas emission levels have already committed us to at least some level of temperature increase, and therefore a certain level of adaptation measures will be needed as a result," Kibwana said.

The UNFCCC's Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer called for specific activities to be agreed within the five-year work plan on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation.

"We expect countries to take decisions in Nairobi that will enhance action on adaptation on the ground," he said.

Another key outcome expected of the conference is agreement on how to manage the UNFCCC's Adaptation Fund. The fund is financed by a share of proceeds generated by the Kyoto Protocol's clean development mechanism (CDM).

The CDM permits industrialized countries which are members of the protocol to invest in sustainable development projects in developing countries, and thereby generate tradable emission credits.

"Ministers meeting in Nairobi have an opportunity to reach agreement on critical elements of the governance and management of the Adaptation Fund," the UN top climate change official said.

Kibwana called on the meeting to address the key obstacles faced by the least developed countries, in particular those in Africa, in participating successfully in the CDM.

He added that after a successful start in May 2006 in Bonn, discussion on future action to mitigate climate change would continue in Nairobi.

One track is for negotiating commitments beyond 2012 for countries under the Kyoto Protocol, the other deals with talks under the UNFCCC on the future of the climate change process, with a focus on how to advance development in a sustainable way and on how to realize the full potential of market-based opportunities.

"We need an equitable and effective future climate change regime that enables us to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases while at the same time allowing economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner," Kibwana said.
