The Association of Muslim Scholars on Friday called on Sunni Arab politicians to withdraw from the government and parliament after the authorities issued an arrest warrant for the most prominent Sunni cleric, Harith al-Dhari.

"A call on the political groups to withdraw from the parliament and the government, which it has proved that is not a national unity government," the Association spokesman, Abul Salam al- Kubaisi, told reporters.

"The warrant was issued to cover the acts of the government's security forces that kill dozens of Iraqis every day," Kubaisi said.

On Thursday, Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani said that al-Dhari, was trying to "spread division and strife among the Iraqi people and will be chased by our security agencies."

The arrest warrant was issued days after al-Dhari was accused by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki of "inciting sectarian and ethnic sedition."

Dhari, 65, who is safe from arrest in neighboring Jordan, reported the pan Arab al-Jazeera television on Friday, adding that the Iraqi government is "provoking crises" with him to cover its failure in facing up the militias loyal to government Shiite political parties.

Dhari, the secretary general of the Association of Muslim Scholars, described the arrest warrant of the Shiite-dominated government as "illegal" and that he would return to Iraq at the appropriate time.

However, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in the day that the Iraqi government has not ordered an arrest warrant for Dhari, but it was only to open a criminal investigation into his activities.

"There is an investigation warrant related to the activities of Sheikh Dhari and they are not final," Dabbagh told state-run Iraqia television.

"Iraqi government issued an arrest warrant is not accurate. We confirm that this news were out of context," Dabbagh said.

Al-Dhari is the top leader for Iraq's Sunni minority and reportedly is an outspoken critic of Al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government.

He often travels abroad and it is not clear whether he is in the country when the arrest warrant was issued late Thursday.
