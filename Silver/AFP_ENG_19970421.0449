UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the rapid repatriation of up to 100,000 Rwandan refugees stranded and sick in camps in eastern Zaire, saying imminent action was needed to save lives.

Annan, in a statement issued in Geneva before he returned to New York after a 24-hour visit, called on an "all parties to stop fighting and allow the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population caught in the conflict."

UN refugee chief Sadako Ogata, who discussed the refugee crisis with Annan, also called on the Kisangani authorities to "take urgent action to airlift Rwandan refugees home," insisting that delays would lead to more deaths and that repatriation was the only solution for these people.

A first batch of Rwandan refugees was supposed to be airlifted out of Kisangani on Friday, but Zairean Tutsi rebels who control the city blocked the move.

They apparently fear that cholera plaguing the Kasese and Biaro camps south of Kisangani, which shelter some 80,000 individuals, would contaminate the city. Relief workers on the ground, claiming the cholera outbreak is containable, said there was no such risk.

They want to begin a major operation to fly refugees from Kisangani more than 500 kilometres (300 miles) southeastwards to Goma, on the border with Rwanda, for repatriation, the but the exercise has been postponed indefinately. Goma is the "capital" of rebel-held eastern Zaire.

"I hope repatriation and air-bridge operations will start very soon to save the lives of the vulnerable women and children needing better care," Annan said.

Outbreaks of violence over the last four days among the local population, including the looting Monday of a relief train carrying 120 tonnes of food south of Kisangani, have interrupted aid agency operations in the camps.

"Since Friday a series of security incidents, including the looting of foodstocks, has blocked our access to the camps. Today the military told us that we would not be allowed in the camps because of a security operation in the area," Ogata said.

"This is not good enough. We must have access and we must begin the airlift. Every day's delay means more lives lost. Repatriation is the only solution for these people, the only way to guarantee their safety."

The UNHCR is calling for security guarantees for its staff to carry out their urgent humanitarian work in the camps and to help defuse tensions between the refugees and the local population which is clamouring to benefit from humanitarian agency assistance.

In Goma, UNHCR spokesman Filipo Grandi on Monday told AFP that "the (rebel) military authorities have asked humanitarian organizations to stop all their operations in the camps until further notice.

"No agency can go to the left bank" of the Zaire river, to which they need access to reach the camps, Grandi added. "We are extremely concerned about the deterioration in the security situation, which has prevented humanitarian agencies from providing help to the camps and nearby villages for the third time in four days."

Last week's attack on UNHCR vehicles led to the first suspension of assistance, which resumed on the weekend.

The refugees went on a five-month trekking odyssey following the launch of the rebels' offensive against President Mobutu Sese Seko's army in October.

They escaped to Zaire following the civil war in Rwanda in 1994 in which Tutsi rebels toppled the governing Hutu regime after Hutu extremists massacred half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
