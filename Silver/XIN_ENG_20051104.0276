The board of the Athens Bar Association on Friday called for complete removal of all the surveillance cameras installed for Olympic security last year citing the reason of violating civil rights of Athenians.

The association outlined a series of objections to the operation of surveillance cameras on the streets of Athens, ostensibly to monitor traffic flow.

The cameras had been installed as a security measure during the Athens Olympics in 2004, but their use has only be sanctioned for monitoring traffic by Greece's independent Authority for the Protection of Personal Data.

It said that the technical capacity of the cameras already installed far exceeds the needs for monitoring traffic and their use can very easily be extended to the visual and audio surveillance and recording to incidents according to the instructions of the system's user.

It added that the government has failed to comply with the conditions set by the Data Protection Authority for the operation of the system, nor its demand for the removal of cameras that don't serve the sanctioned use.

It stressed that the use of surveillance system is in direct violation of the Constitutional rights to social and political freedom, identity, public gatherings, protection from the use of one's personal data and private life.

The association also expressed its opposition to the public order ministry's plans to extend the permitted usage of the cameras and demands that they immediate cease operating and be removed.
