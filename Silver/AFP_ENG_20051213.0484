Israel has put off opening a bus link between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank because of the Palestinian Authority's failure to stop militants from firing rockets on the country, its army chief of staff said Tuesday.

"Israel has no intention of allowing the passage of convoys between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank while the Palestinian Authority does not act to stop the firing of the Qassam (homemade) rockets," General Dan Halutz was quoted by parliamentary sources as saying.

Under an agreement in principle reached between the two sides last month brokered by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the service was to have begun on Thursday.

The announcement comes as no suprise.

Last week, Israel froze negotiations on the details, with a spokesman for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon saying: "There will be no discussions about these convoys as long as the Palestinian Authority fails to respect its commitments to fight against terrorism."

The security cabinet took the decision on December 6, a day after a suicide bomber from the radical Palestinian movement Islamic Jihad killed five Israelis at the entrance to a shopping mall.

Under the deal, Israel should also allow convoys of trucks to travel between Gaza and the West Bank from January 15.

At the time, a senior security official quoted by the Haaretz daily attributed the decision to halt the negotiations to Israeli concerns about the monitoring of travellers crossing the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt since it reopened late last month, alleging that "hostile elements" had entered the territory.

The Palestinians have been pushing for residents of Gaza and the West Bank to be allowed to travel back and forth, while Israel was insisting on limiting movement to Gazans.

At the same time, Israel wants to ban travel by men between the ages of 16 and 35.

The Israeli media have said a working document proposed by the United States talks of five, five-bus convoys making the trip each day, transporting 1,800 Palestinians. In contrast, Israel wants only one such convoy, limiting the number to 250.
