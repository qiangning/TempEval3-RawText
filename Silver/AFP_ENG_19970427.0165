A moderate earthquake rattled Los Angeles early Sunday for the second day in a row, spiking at 4.9 on the open-ended Richter scale, a spokeswoman with the US Geological Survey said.

There were no immediate reports of damage.

Pat Jurgenson said the quake hit at 4:09 a.m. (1109 GMT) with the center at Val Verde about 48 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Los Angeles.

She said it was yet another in a series of aftershocks from the January 1994 Northridge quake and that it would probably be followed by other minor ones through the morning.

She said they are all aftershocks of the 6.7 Northridge quake in January 1994 that claimed 61 lives and devastated parts of Los Angeles.

On Saturday, the largest temblor that was centered in the same region hit 5.0 on the open-ended Richter scale. That initial quake was followed by another temblor measuring 4.0 and then several smaller ones.
