Chief negotiator of the Republic of Korea (ROK) to the six-party talks urged here Wednesday all parties to have more patience in the new round of talks.

The path is still "open" for all sides to implement the joint statement through consultations, Song Min-soon told reporters when leaving the hotel to attend the fifth round of the six-party talks, which opened in Beijing Wednesday morning.

The fifth-round talks will lay the groundwork for carrying out the first joint statement among the parties, he said, adding that in the coming three days, all parties will exchange views and hold consultations in this regard.

Song admitted that differences exist among the parties, but all sides will find out methods to narrow the differences.

The ROK delegation will hold bilateral consultations with other delegations respectively on Wednesday afternoon, Song added.
