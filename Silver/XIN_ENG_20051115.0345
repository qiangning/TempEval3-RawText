Warren Feeney capitalized on a rare international start by scoring Northern Ireland's goal in their 1-1 draw against Portugal on Tuesday.

The Luton Town striker, who had not started for over three years and was a sub for the last seven games, scored with a looping header in the 53rd minute.

World Cup finalists Portugal had led through a Stephen Craigan own goal five minutes before half-time when the Motherwell defender diverted a Ronaldo cross past keeper Maik Taylor.

Northern Ireland did well to battle back against Luiz Filipe Scolari's side and the result allowed them to end the year on a positive note.

Back-to-back defeats against Wales and Austria in the World Cup qualifiers had taken some of the gloss off the famous victory against England.

However, they bounced back against a side ranked eighth in the world thanks to Feeney's equaliser.

Given manager Lawrie Sanchez was without a number of key players, he could claim a moral victory.

There were good performances from goalkeeper Maik Taylor and midfielder Steve Davis and Portugal knew they had been in a game.

The Belfast fans were also able to celebrate the appearance of Irish League star Peter Thompson.

The Linfield striker, with 18 goals this season, came on as a substitute for James Quinn with 14 minutes left.

Dean Shiels of Hibernian also won his first cap, coming on just before the end.
