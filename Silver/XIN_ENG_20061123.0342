Brazil's Federal Police arrested 33 people in a joint operation with the Environment Agency on Thursday, and charged them with illegally exploiting indigenous people's land.

The detainees had taken part in illegal logging operations in Brazil's permanent reserves, and had occupied land reserved for the Kayabi, Mundukuru and Apiaka indigenous groups in the east-central state of Mato Grosso, the police said.

The indigenous reserves cover an area of nearly 1 million hectares, and were created in Oct. 2002 through a decree from the Justice Ministry.

The police began investigations in December 2005 following a request from the Federal Prosecution Office, and found that the illegal seizure of indigenous reserves became more frequent after the 2002 decree.

Up to now, 300,000 square km of indigenous reserves have been deforested and replaced by agriculture and cattle pastures.
