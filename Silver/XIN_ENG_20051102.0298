The United States has filed a trade case with the World Trade Organization (WTO) accusing Turkey of imposing unfair restrictions on US rice exports, US Trade Representative Rob Portman announced Wednesday.

"Right now American rice exporters are being unfairly restricted. That's wrong," Portman said in a statement.

The decision to file a case with the WTO came after discussions with Turkey had failed to resolve the dispute, he said.

The trade case contends that Turkey's import licensing system violates global trading rules by imposing significant barriers to the sale of US rice in the country, according to the statement.

The United States said that its rice sales to Turkey had declined by two-thirds since 2003 due to the restrictions with sales of US milled and semi-milled rice falling by 91 percent over this period.

As the first step after a case is filed, consultations are required under WTO rules. If those discussions do not resolve the issue, the dispute can proceed to a hearing before a WTO panel.
