South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun on Friday met with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, strongly protesting the latter's repeated pilgrimages to a controversial war shrine.

The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here.

Koizumi, however, defended his position that the visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japanese war dead, including war criminals, are not aimed at paying homage to the war criminals but to repent for the past.
