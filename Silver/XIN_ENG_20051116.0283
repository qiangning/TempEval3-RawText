Inventories held by US businesses on shelves and backlots increased by 0.5 percent in September, marking the largest gain in eight months, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.

Data released by the department showed that business sales in September totaled 1,021.6 billion dollars, up 0.6 percent from the previous month and up 7.8 percent from the same month last year.

Business inventories in September were estimated at an end-of- month level of 1,282.1 billion dollars, up 0.5 percent from the previous month and up 4.3 percent from the same month last year.

The 0.5 percent gain in September's inventories was down slightly from an advance of 0.7 percent in the previous month.

Data also showed that the total business inventories-to-sales ratio based on seasonally adjusted data at the end of September was 1.25.

Economists see rising inventories either as a sign of confidence in future demand or as a result of an unexpected decline in sales.
