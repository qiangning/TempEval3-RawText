New Zealand Women's Affairs Minister Christine Fletcher rected angrily Tuesday to news that a bar she owns has staged a raunchy Australian strip show.

"I'm quite horrified," Fletcher said. "Some may call it entertainment -- I reject that. It's exploitation not only of women's bodies but of men's bodies."

Fletcher with husband Angus own the Whitianga Hotel on the Coromandel coast, east of here.

A standing-room only, all-male audience paid 10 New Zealand dollars (seven US) a head to watch the five-woman 'Seductions Australia' group strip themselves naked.

Fletcher said she had known nothing about the show and they would now reconsider the contract of their hotel manager, Hugh Rhodes.

She said they had wanted the hotel to be a place for families and a strip show was "entirely inconsistent with our vision".
