The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has won 35.94 percent in the elections for Zagreb city council, a key battlefield with the opposition, according to preliminary results announced early Monday.

The figures were slightly down from its share of the vote after local elections in 1995 when it won 36.55 percent.

Electoral commission chairman Ivan Mrkonjic said that with about half the votes counted, the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) in coalition with the tiny Croatian People's Party (HNS) had won 23.87 percent, a small rise on 1995.

The Croatian Social and Liberal Party (HSLS) had won 12.24 percent, as against 12.87 percent it won two years ago.

In elections in 1995, the opposition won control of the city council after which Tudjman four times vetoed their choice of mayor, drawing international condemnation.

Final results for the local, regional and upper house polls were expected Monday or Tuesday.
