Many of the EU countries hoping to sign up to the euro are making progress in meeting economic conditions but must do more on inflation or spending deficits, the European Central Bank said on Tuesday.

Compared with a so-called convergence report published two years ago, the ECB found in its 2006 study that "many of the countries under review have made progress with economic convergence".

However, "in some countries there have also been setbacks", the guardian of the euro wrote.

In order to be able to adopt the euro, candidate countries must fulfil a total five different convergence criteria, most importantly with regard to inflation and to strict budgetary discipline.

The 2006 convergence report examined nine countries with respect to their fulfilment of the different criteria for euro entry: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden.

Two other countries, Slovenia and Lithuania, had already been the object of a convergence report in May this year and so were not included in the latest report.

Slovenia is scheduled to adopt the euro from January 1, 2007.

Of the nine countries examined this time round, four had inflation rates below the reference value of 2.8 percent, namely the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Poland and Sweden, the ECB found.

"However, in some countries with inflation above the reference value, significant increases in inflation have been recorded in recent years," the report said.

The largest deviations were seen in Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia, it found.

With regard to the budgetary situation, five countries currently had so-called excessive deficits -- public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of output -- namely the Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.

Furthermore, "further fiscal consolidation is required in most of the countries under review," the ECB said.

The ECB did not give any recommendation as to the possible date when the euro aspirants might adopt the euro.

The EU Commission in Brussels published its own separate report at the same time, in which it found that none of the prospective euro candidates fulfilled all of the necessary criteria.

The ECB does not only look at the different economic criteria, but also examines the legal framework within the countries wanting to adopt the euro, particularly with regard to central bank independence.

On this front, the bank expressed "particular concern about recent growing signs of pressure being put on the decision-making bodies of some member states' national central banks, which would be inconsistent with the spirit of the (Maastricht) Treaty as regards central bank independence".

The ECB said it was "closely monitor any developments" in this area "prior to any final positive assessment" with regard to euro membership.

The bank did not name any specific country. But ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet publicly expressed concern earlier this year about the independence of the Polish central bank.
