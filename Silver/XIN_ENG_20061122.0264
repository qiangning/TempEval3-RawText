Bangladeshi President Prof. Iajuddin Ahmed said Wednesday night he hoped he would be able to present the country a clean general election with the help of people and all political parties.

In a televised speech, Ahmed said, "I am before you for the second time after I took the charge of the office of Chief Advisor of a neutral caretaker government on October 29. I am committed to discharge the responsibility given on me to hold a free and fair election."

Ahmed, 76, said some political parties questioned about the neutrality of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) MA Aziz. "Since I cannot sack him constitutionally, I had sent three of my advisors to him with a request to Aziz to go on a long leave or resign. Moreover, I had telephonic talks with Aziz. He honoring my request agreed to go on a leave for three months."

Ahmed, a former university teacher, said a political stalemate was created as CEC was sticking to his stand not to resign despite the political parties was wanting. He hoped the political standoff will now come to an end.

The president also said since CEC has gone on leave, he will appoint two more election commissioners for holding a free, fair and acceptable election.

He said he hoped all political parties and the people will maintain restraint, and extend all out cooperation in staging the desired election within the time frame of three months.

Ahmed also called upon the all concerned officials having link with the elections to remain above fear and work with honesty and neutrality for discharging their duties in presenting the nation clean and acceptable election.

Ahmed called upon his advisory council to work to return the normalcy of all activities.

"Our holy responsibility is to present the nation a free and election and we will have to do it for the sake of people of the country," he said.

In Bangladesh a non-partisan caretaker government organizes the general election in line with the country's constitution and hands over power to elected government since 1996.
