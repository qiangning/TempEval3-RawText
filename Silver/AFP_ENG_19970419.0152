Hopes of direct talks between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila receded Saturday, as demands that Mobutu quit immediately enraged his entourage and damaged prospects of a face-saving exit.

Mobutu's special advisor said Friday the president had agreed in principle to meet Kabila at the request of South African President Nelson Mandela.

But, as the rebels insist the only negotiations they will agree to must be on the manner of his departure, and given the differences on a ceasefire that still divide the warring sides, the chances of an encounter appear remote.

Mobutu's aide, Honore Ngbanda Nzambo, told a news conference Friday that Mobutu had accepted Mandela's invitation for talks, but practical details on time and date remained to be sorted out.

Later Friday, the Zairean government called for a "complete and immediate cessation of hostilities."

Mandela's spokesman was more confident, saying Mobutu could meet Kabila in Cape Town "in the first part of next week, probably on Monday or Tuesday."

However, that supposes a sudden climbdown on the part of Kabila who, with his forces already in control of half the nation and most of its vast mineral resources, can call the shots.

Kabila has not yet confirmed that he will meet Mobutu, who the rebels have continually called on to resign throughout their six-month campaign.

On Friday, rebel "foreign minister" Bizima Kahara restated that position, saying "Mobutu must quit power" and "no ceasefire is possible before the end of the war," nor would the rebels ever share power.

"We will not stop hostilities, we want an end to the war. We cannot sign a ceasefire with mercenaries," he added, stating that both negotiations and the military option were open to the rebels.

Ngbanda rejected any suggestion that Mobutu should relinquish his 32-year rule or go into exile, but said there was agreement between the two sides on free and fair elections open to all, including the president.

Cancer-stricken Mobutu, 66, has resolutely clung to power despite the rebel onslaught and announced he may stand if presidential elections are held.

Given his long autocratic hold on power, the rebel demands -- coupled with hints from capitals around the world that he should resign -- must be hurting Mobutu's pride.

Kabila meanwhile continues to threaten to take Kinshasa by June, but says he will spare the lives of expatriates, as if hinting they could be hostages. The rebels say they are 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the capital, although diplomats put them further away.

"What difference is there for Zaire between Mobutu and Kabila," a diplomat here asked Saturday.

"Kabila must understand that routing the Zairean army is one thing, it is not difficult, but colliding with the powerful machinery of the international community is another matter altogether."

The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, also voiced a rumour that has already surfaced in Kinshasa -- the presence of a total of 4,000 Belgian, British, French and US soldiers in neighbouring countries to evacuate foreign nationals if necessary.

"He (Kabila) should ask wy the West has placed so many of your best troops around Zaire ... to evacuate less than 3,000 people."

Kabila himself was due to hold a public meeting on Saturday in Lubumbashi, Zaire's second city and its economic hub, which was captured by the rebels 10 days ago, the rebels' Voice of People radio station reported.

At the end of the morning, local people were starting to converge on foot on the stadium, still named after Mobutu.
