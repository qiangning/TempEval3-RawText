Two people were killed and five others wounded when two roadside bombs went off at central Baghdad district on Sunday, a well-informed police source said.

"Two roadside bombs detonated at about 1:40 a.m. (1040 GMT) in the Fanarah district near the Taiyran Square, killing two civilians and wounding five others," the source said on condition of anonymity.

In an earlier incident, the death toll of a suicide bomb attack at a police commando recruitment center in western Baghdad rose to 35, with up to 60 others wounded, the source said.

Violence rages in Iraq as sectarian killings, car bombings and roadside bombings claim lives of dozens of Iraqis on the daily basis.
