Britain is pulling together a coalition to fight the Taliban and al-Qaida insurgency in southern Afghanistan after next year's partial US pullback, the Guardian newspaper said on Tuesday.

Britain is set to take over NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan in early 2006, when the United States plans to withdraw 4,000 soldiers from a parallel force fighting the rebels.

Talks to create a counter-rebel force were allegedly taking place with several countries, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

British Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram said on Monday that elite paratroopers were already training for possible operations in Afghanistan's lawless Helmand province.

As many as 2,000 more British troops are expected to be sent to Afghanistan next year to increase the UK's forces in the war-torn country to almost 5,000, said the report.

"We are not talking war fighting. But there is potential for armed conflict in some areas," an unnamed military source told the newspaper, adding "the reality is that there are warlords, drug traffickers, al-Qaida, al-Qaida wannabes and Taliban."

The report came amid demands from critics for Britain to seek an exit strategy from Afghanistan, where there is no sign of a letup in the bloodshed with a German ISAF soldier reported to be one of the latest killed in car bomb attacks by Taliban fighters.

The report was also published against the backdrop of NATO's announcement on Monday that it had agreed to the US-proposed closer cooperation in Afghanistan between ISAF peacekeeping force and the US-led coalition fighting insurgents.

The agreement is a step towards ending a dispute sparked last year when France, Germany and others rejected a US proposal for an outright merger of the two forces under overall NATO command.

NATO's 9,000-strong ISAF peacekeeping force is present in the relatively stable north, west and in the capital Kabul. The push to the south will bring its numbers up to 15,000 by early next year, with further expansion to the east also planned.

NATO took over command of ISAF in 2003, two years after US-led forces overthrew the Taliban government.
