The fourth Vasaloppet China international cross-country ski race is to be held in January 2006 in Changchun City, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, an official of the organizing committee said Monday.

"We are busy preparing for the ski race these days," Gong Wenbin, an official of the organizing committee, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview on Monday.

The event, known as Vasaloppet China, will enter its fourth edition in Changchun after it was brought to China in 2003.

"Three experts of the International Ski Federation (FIS) came to Changchun in October this year to help reconstruct the skiing lanes for the competition," Gong said.

"The construction of the new design is underway."

With the theme of cultural exchanges, the fourth Vasaloppet China aims to promote relationship and strengthen exchanges between China and Sweden, Gong said.

In addition, a snow sculpture show and a special ski race for the disabled will be held during the event.

Vasaloppet, a long distance cross-country ski race, is held annually in Sweden and has a long history of more than 80 years.
