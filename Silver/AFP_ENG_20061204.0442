Russia hopes that the next US ambassador to the United Nations will be less "severe" than outgoing envoy John Bolton, a ministry of foreign affairs spokesman said Monday.

Bolton, whose resignation was announced by a White House spokeswoman, "was a very strong professional, although on a series of issues, including problems of UN reform, he supported extremely severe views," the spokesman was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.

"We would like to express the hope that his successor will be able to overcome excessive severity in his approach, and at the same time preserve and develop the positive experience of our cooperation," he added.

US President George W. Bush appointed the controversial, tough-talking Bolton in August 2005 in the face of stiff Democratic opposition.

It was unclear when Bush would announce his choice for a successor to Bolton, who will leave his post at the end of the year.
