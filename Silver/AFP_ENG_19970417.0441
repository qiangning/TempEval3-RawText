Floodwaters from the swollen Red River soared to record high levels in this upper Midwest town Thursday and kept on rising as residents raced to shore up weakening sandbag dikes.

Many residents shook their heads in disbelief as the water kept rolling in and officials said they could not say when the river would crest after nearly two weeks of the worst flooding this century.

The water rose to 13.1 meters (39.3 feet), seven meters (22 feet) above flood stage, eclipsing the previous record of 13 meters (39.1 feet) set in 1897.

Firemen and policemen evacuated four families in the dead of the night as between 15 and 20 homes were flooded.

Two percent of the city was under water. Although there has been no precise estimate of the damage, the flooding is clearly taking its toll. Garbage collection has stopped and several areas are without water.

Several districts are only accessible by boat.

The floodwaters will delay planting of wheat and sugar beets causing an estimated one billion dollars in damages to farmers in the upper plains area.

Protective dikes have been built to a height of 13.3 meters (40 feet) but many are being weakened by the relentless pressure from the floodwaters.

One resident built a 30,000-dollar concrete dike around his home only to see it crack Wednesday. His house was entirely flooded.

In Fargo and in Moorhead, on the Minnesota side of the river, hundreds of volunteers worked throughout the night to shore up leaky levees and dikes or raced to pump water out faster than it came in.

The Red River and its tributaries, swollen by rains and melted snow, spread some 25 kilometers (15 miles) over highways and roads in rural areas here and covered the pancake-flat farmland.
