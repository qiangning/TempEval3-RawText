Peru's army on Thursday honored the two soldiers who died in the raid to free 72 hostages from the Japanese ambassador's residence in an emotional ceremony before laying the bodies to rest.

Colonel Juan Valer Sandoval and Capitan Raul Jimenez died Tuesday in the bold attack on the mansion that freed 71 of the hostages.

One hostage, a judge, died of a heart attack after being shot and all 14 of the Tupac Amaru rebel commando inside the residence were slain.

Fujimori's son, Kenji wept as his father praised the two soldier's valor in facing a "cruel and fanatical enemy."

"What a great honor for a Peruvian soldier" to die in battle "but that does not impede us from crying" for the losses, Fujimori said.

Valer was in charge of Kenji Fujimori's personal safety during his vacations from university in Boston, Massachusetts. Kenji arrived in Lima late Wednesday.

Armed forces chief Nicolas Hermoza also wept as he remembered the fallen soldiers.

The president's son kissed the flag-drapped coffin of his protector and friend and placed a plaque on the casket.

Valer, 38, received gunshot wounds from rebel fire as he tried to protect Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, one of the hostages, from the bullets. He is survived by his wife Luz Collado Escuza and two children.

Collado sobbed as she was handed the red and white Peruvian flag that had covered her husband's coffin as her two small children looked on sadly.

Jimienez, 27, was shot in the neck as he tried to usher other hostages out of the residence.

Valer and Jiminez were promoted post-humously to the ranks of colonel and captain, respectively.
