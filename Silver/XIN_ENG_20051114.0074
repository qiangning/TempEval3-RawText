A senior leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) was shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Nablus early on Monday, Palestinian sources said.

The sources said Israeli troops backed by 15 military jeeps raided eastern Nablus early on Monday and Israeli soldiers stormed a building where Amjan Hannawi, commander of Hamas' armed wing Ezzel Dein al-Qassam Brigades in Nablus, was hiding.

Hannawi, 32, was shot in the head and died on the spot when he tried to flee the building, the sources added.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army confirmed the killing, saying that Hannawi is one of the most wanted Palestinian militants, who is believed to have masterminded several suicide bombings in Israel in the 1990s.

In addition, eight other suspected Hamas militants were also arrested during the raid, the army added.

Al-Qassam Brigades vowed revenge in a statement.

A few hours after the incident, a Palestinian was killed and at least two others wounded by Israeli troops' gunfire in the Gaza Strip.

Monday's violence has cast pall over a visit to the region by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to revive the stalled peace process.

Israel has stepped up raids and targeted killings of Palestinian militants since a suicide bomb attack killed six Israelis in a seaside city last month.

The recent worsening of violence has dampened peace hopes ignited by the Israel Gaza withdrawal in September.
