A total of 205 international observers will begin to arrive in Venezuela on Tuesday to monitor the South American country's presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 3, the National Electoral Council said on Monday.

Incumbent President Hugo Chavez, who is running for re-election, is favored to beat opposition candidate Manuel Rosales.

The observers will inspect the voting stations and supervise the counting and the process of announcing the voting results.

They will release their conclusions at a press conference after exchanging views with the National Electoral Council on Dec. 5.

The international groups watching the elections include the European Union, the Organization of American States and the Common Market of the South (Mercosur).

About 130 representatives from the European Union have already arrived in Venezuela. In addition, eight to 10 observers from the Carter Center will also oversee the elections.

Nearly 16 million voters have registered to vote in the upcoming elections.
