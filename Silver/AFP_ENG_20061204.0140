World oil prices dropped on Monday after striking two-month high points the previous week on supply concerns.

In London, Brent North Sea crude for January delivery slid 52 cents to 64.10 dollars in electronic trading.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in January, lost 45 cents to 62.98 dollars per barrel in electronic deals before the official opening of the US market.

World oil prices had risen sharply last week, mainly owing to data that revealed falls in US energy stocks and expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will decide later this month to cut further its oil output.
