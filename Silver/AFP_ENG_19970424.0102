Shanghai's residents have developed a taste for expensive imported fruits, some as exotic as the thorny durian from Malaysia, a newspaper reported Thursday.

The Shanghai Youth Daily said that despite their high prices, imported fruits have made their way into the homes ordinary families, which buy them as gifts or just because they like the taste of the exotic.

Until several years ago, Shanghai's market was closed to imported fruits but now shoppers can buy durians for 60 yuan (7.2 dollars) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), Thai lychees for 68 yuan a kilogram and Sunkist oranges for 12 yuan a kilogram.

Some Shanghai parents buy only imported fruits for their only child while tourists from the provinces consider imported fruits as something special to bring home from Shanghai, the report said.

Wholesalers can mark up the price of imported fruits 100 percent and retailers add another 20 to 50 percent, while the products face duties of 50 percent and value added tax of 13 percent.
