The air force chiefs of ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member countries have agreed to increase cooperation in the procurement of spare parts for both transport and fighter planes.

The agreement was reached at the two-day third ASEAN Air Chiefs ' Conference (AACC) concluded here Wednesday.

Indonesia had so far cooperated with several other ASEAN member countries in procurement of spare parts for Hercules transport and Hawk fighter planes, Indonesian Air Force Chief of Staff Marshal Herman Prayitno said on Wednesday.

"Most ASEAN member countries have Hercules transport and Hawk fighter planes. So if we have a spare part problem we can ask for help from Malaysia or Singapore," he said on the sidelines of Indo Defense Expo and Forum 2006.

Under the spare parts cooperation, Indonesia could "borrow" parts from its ASEAN neighbors. The parts would be returned after Indonesia had obtained replacements from producing countries like the United States in the case of Hercules parts.

Indonesia had so far cooperated with Singapore in parts supply for Hawk fighters and "we will consider doing it with the Philippines and other countries," he said.

Besides discussing parts procurement, the third AACC also dwelt on terrorism and security stability in the region and the handling of natural disasters.

On anti-terrorism cooperation, the ASEAN air force chiefs agreed to conduct exchange of information and joint patrols and to increase cooperation in training and education.

Indonesia has held joint exercises with other ASEAN member countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, he said.

The AACC was attended by the air force chiefs of staff of Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

The first AACC was held in Thailand in 2004 and the second in Malaysia in 2005.
