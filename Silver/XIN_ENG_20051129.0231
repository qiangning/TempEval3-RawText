The Johannesburg Security Exchange finished in negative territory for the second successive day on Tuesday, weighed down by a relatively strong rand and soft world markets.

Traders said fresh long-term highs by both gold and platinum were countered by the rand while the market also witnessed some profit-taking.

The JSE also showed no reaction to gross domestic product data released on Tuesday morning which, although good, was much in line with expectations.

The all share and industrial indices ended down 0.97 percent and 0.95 percent respectively. The resources index was off 1.37 percent and the gold mining index was 1.90 percent weaker, with the platinum mining index 2.18 percent lower.

The financial and banking indices were down 0.33 percent and 0. 54 percent respectively.
