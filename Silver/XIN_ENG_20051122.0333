Brazil will be based at a luxury lakeside hotel in Switzerland in the run-up to next year's World Cup finals in Germany, the Brazilian Football Confederation said Tuesday.

The four-time world champions will prepare for the defence of their crown in Weggis, on the shores of Lake Lucerne, from May 22 to June 4 and will have exclusive use of the hotel, the CBF said on its official website.

The tournament starts on June 9.

The CBF did not say whether Brazil had fixed up any friendly internationals during the period.
