More than 10,000 soldiers have been mobilized and at least one million yuan (about 123,000 US dollars) will be allocated in the disaster relief in central China's quake-hit areas, said the sources with the provincial governments of Jiangxi and Hubei on Monday.

The Jiangxi provincial government said it was launching its emergency plan shortly after the quake struck and mobilized more than 10,000 soldiers and militia members to help restore the normal order of life and production in Jiujiang.

As of Monday evening, the rescuers have found and saved more than 200 people who were trapped in the collapsed buildings.

Meanwhile, more than 50,000 people who were affected by the disaster have been relocated by the local government.

In the nearby Hubei Province, which was also partially hit by the earthquake, the provincial government decides to allocate at least one million yuan (about 123,000 US dollars) to give free medical treatment to people who were injured in the quake.

The provincial government held a special conference on Monday to strengthen the disaster relief work, adding that an earthquake prevention and disaster relief responsibility system will immediately take effect in Hubei.

The majority of the schools in the quake-hit areas resumed class Monday, which unanimously gave the students lessons concerning earthquake and the survival skills.

To further monitor the Jiujiang earthquake, the China Seismological Bureau organized a panel composed of more than 50 seismologists, to head toward the two provinces.

The experts will carry out field inspections and set up 11 seismographs in both Jiangxi and Hubei for earthquake prevention and study.

An earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale jolted the city of Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, on Saturday, leaving at least 14 dead.
