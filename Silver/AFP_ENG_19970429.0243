Three Chinese warships have entered territory claimed by the Philippines in the Spratly islands and Manila will file a diplomatic protest to Beijing, Press Secretary Hector Villanueva said Tuesday.

Armed forces chief General Arnulfo Acedera has reported to President Fidel Ramos that the warships were monitored near two South China Sea islands, he said in a statement.

China and the Philippine are among six countries which claim all or part of the Spratlys, which are believed to sit atop oil deposits and command strategic shipping lanes.

Acedera said a military reconaissance plane monitored the three Chinese frigates "in the immediate vicinity" of Kota and Panata islands, which are among eight islands occupied by Filipino troops in the South China Sea chain.

Villanueva said the frigate-type vessels, armed with deck guns, were sighted on April 25. The plane also discovered a "new hut-like structure" built on a reef six miles northeast of Kota island.

He did not say if this structure was manned by Chinese troops.

One of the vessels as "positively identified" as belonging to the Shuguang 04 class with bow number 427. It was "observed to be accompanied by two small fishing boats and was towing two other boats," Villanueva said.

Another vessel, with bow number 420, was identified as belonging to the Hai class, Villanueva said but did not give a description of the third vessel.

"The Department of Foreign Affairs is sending a diplomatic protest to its counterpart in Beijing and will inform its ASEAN counterparts of these developments," Villanueva said.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. All but Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand are Spratly claimants. Taiwan also is a claimant.

Villanueva said Acedera has instructed the commander of the Western Command which covers the Spratlys "to undertake continous surveillance of the area."
