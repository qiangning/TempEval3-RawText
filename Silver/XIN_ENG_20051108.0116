Urbanites suffer the phobia that the whole world has deserted them only because they forget to bring their cellphones. Trendies, though not necessarily high earners, buy a new handset every three months. Cellphones embedded with diamonds are sold at 210,000 yuan each (25,900 US dollars).

In booming China, cellphone is not just a communication device, but also a luxury and a symbol of one's status and taste, said Sun Yuanming, a sociologist with the Chongqing Municipal Academy of Social Sciences.

Ministry of Information Industry says the Chinese were throwing away 70 million cellphones a year by mid 2004, according to the latest data available.

Piles of deserted cellphones -- most of which worked perfectly though weren't stylish enough -- have overloaded the resource-thirsty Chinese economy and threatened its environment with massive electronic waste, whose proper disposal remains a problem.

On top of it, to buy a trendy cellphone every three months is not a piece of cake even for many extravagant consumers.

"I saved for six months and was even ready to cut my meals to buy that cellphone. It cost 5,000 yuan (616 US dollars) but is worth it -- it has a superb lens and make very good videos," said a junior clerk at a Beijing bank, surnamed Yu.

This is already his third cellphone in two years, though Yu makes less than 4,000 yuan (493 US dollars) a month, nearly two thirds of which has to repay his housing loan.

"Most customers are more interested in the accessory functions of cellphones: whether they play MP3, shoot videos or have the latest games," said Liu, a sales clerk at a Beijing-based store.

Three years after the first camera phone debuted in 2002, China's mobile communication market is in full bloom with novel cellphone brands and diverse functions.

"In most American and European markets, a cellphone is just a communication device and it doesn't matter much how it looks. In China and some other Asian countries, however, a phone has to be fashionable to catch the buyers' eyes," said Liu.

Nearly 60 percent of China's mobile subscribers are in the market for a new cellphone; 12.8 percent of them buy a new handset every six to 12 months and 24.4 percent buy one every 12 to 24 months, according to a recent survey by China Center of Information Industry Development (CCID).

At the end of 2004, there were 25.7 mobile phones for every 100 Chinese, which exceeded the world average, statistics released at the 2005 China Mobile Telecommunications Terminal Development Forum showed.

It also predicted that the number of mobile phone subscribers in China would top 380 million by the end of this year, and soar to 520 million by 2008 and 600 million by 2010.

Incompatibility between different brands and even between different cellphones from the same manufacturer simply produces more waste.

Suppose each subscriber buys a new cellphone every three years, and each cellphone is equipped with two batteries and one charger, an average 200 million batteries and 100 million chargers become wastes every year.

"In fact, most people absent-mindedly put their outdated cellphones away -- after all, it's not easy to throw away something that used to cost dearly," said Sun Yuanming, a Chongqing-based sociologist. "But the proper disposal of these e-wastes remains a problem in the long run."

Lithium batteries and chargers contain copper, aluminium and plastics that are not degradable and threaten the environment, says Wang Xiaoming, an expert with Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. "Besides, deserted cellphones also contain precious metal. It'd be a huge waste if the valuable materials are not recalled for reuse."
