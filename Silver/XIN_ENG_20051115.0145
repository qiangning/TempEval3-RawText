The Indonesian Military will withdraw 5,556 troops from Aceh in the further phase of military pullout agreed in the Aug. 15 Helsinki peace accord between the government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), a high-ranking officer said Tuesday.

"In line with our commitment to the agreed peace process, thousands of non-organic military troops will be relocated in stages to their original bases starting this week, at the same time with the third phase of GAM's arms dismantling," Maj. Gen. Supiadin, commander of the Islandar Muda Military Command in Aceh, was quoted by the Antara news agency as saying.

Under the Helsinki agreement, the government will cut by a half the number of troops in Aceh to 14,700 and reduce its police force to 9,100 before the end of the year.

The police this week will also withdraw 1,350 policemen from Aceh to honor the Helsinki agreement, which ended a civil war of three decades between government troops and GAM guerillas.
