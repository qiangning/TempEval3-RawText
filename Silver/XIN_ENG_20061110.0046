Indonesia Friday dismissed a report that it would sign a security pact with Australia during the bilateral meeting scheduled Monday on the resort island of Lombok.

"The security cooperation agreement that we are about to sign ( with Australia ) is not a security pact," Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said at a news conference at his office here.

The security cooperation framework covers mutual respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries, he said.

"In the security agreement, Australia puts its firm stance over the sovereignty of all Indonesian territories, including Papua, in a written statement," the minister said.

The draft of the agreement also covers bilateral cooperation in a wide range of security areas, including the fight against terrorism, smuggling and trafficking in people; aviation safety; natural disaster emergency response and nuclear energy.

The draft agreement is different from the security pact both countries signed in 1995, in which both countries agreed to help each other in case of attacks by another country, said Wirajuda.

The 1995 security pact was revoked in 1999, when Indonesia- Australia ties fell to the lowest due to the presence of Australian forces in East Timor, once one of Indonesian provinces that seceded from the Jakarta rule that year.
