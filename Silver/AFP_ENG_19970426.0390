A North Korean defector walked into South Korea early Sunday across the heavily armed demilitarized zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas, the Defense Ministry said.

The ministry identified the defector as Jang Yong-Kwan, 38, a civilian who was found seeking asylum in the eastern section of the DMZ by South Korean border guards at 4:00 a.m. Sunday (1900 GMT Saturday).

"The defector was guided safe into our region and put under protective custody," a ministry spokesman told AFP.

He was the first defector since North Korea's top ideologue Hwang Jang-Yop arrived in Seoul on April 20, 67 days after he sought asylum in Beijing.

The defense ministry said details on the latest defector would be withheld pending an investigation into the motive for his defection and background in the North.

On February 27, a barefoot 25-year-old North Korean woman crossed the DMZ into South Korea in a daylight defection bid.

The woman from the Yongbyon district of Pyongbuk province, north of Pyongyang, told investigators she crossed the border because of hunger and discontent.
