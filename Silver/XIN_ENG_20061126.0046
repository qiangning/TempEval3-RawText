A suicide bombing killed nine Afghans and injured over 20 others Sunday in the center of Urgon district of Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan, an official of Interior Ministry told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.

"The incident occurred in a restaurant, which local officials frequently visited," the official said.

Meanwhile, the provincial governor Akram Khapalwak told Xinhua that the blast, which happened at around 10:00 a.m., killed seven people and wounded 20 others.

Barmal district chief Mohammad Mubin, who was there by chance, and a police chief were among the injured, he added.

However, locals said 10 persons were killed and about 30 others injured in the explosion.

All bazaars and shops in the center of Urgon have been shut down in the wake of the blast and local police have launched an investigation into the incident.

It is not very clear what motivation is behind the blast, but a man named Mullah Abdul Samad, who claimed himself as a local Taliban commander, said a Taliban fighter carried out the attack.

He claimed a number of Afghan soldiers were killed and injured in the explosion.

Paktika has been a hotbed of Taliban and other militants, who attack government and foreign targets frequently.

A suicide bombing killed Paktika governor Abdul Hakim Taniwal on Sept. 10, and the Taliban claimed responsibility.

Due to rising Taliban-linked violence this year, Afghanistan has plunged into the worst spate of bloodshed since the Taliban regime was toppled down nearly five years ago.

Over 3,800 people, mostly Taliban militants, have been killed in this volatile country this year. Among the fatalities are over 150 foreign soldiers.
