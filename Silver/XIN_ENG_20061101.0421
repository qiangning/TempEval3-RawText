More than three million Vietnamese people, or over 3.6 percent of the country's population, suffer from diabetes, according to local newspaper Pioneer on Thursday.

Millions of other local people face the risk of contracting the disease, the paper quoted reports at a seminar held by the Vietnam Diabetes and Endocrine Association as saying on Wednesday.

The situation results from low awareness of local people on the disease, weak grassroots health networks, and changes in residents' lifestyle such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and obesity, said the reports.

Vietnam is focusing on raising public awareness about the danger of diabetes and ways of preventing it such as using appropriate diet, increasing physical activities and reducing weight, and improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment systems nationwide.

The country currently has one hospital, five centers and five hospital faculties specializing in endocrinology, said the report.
