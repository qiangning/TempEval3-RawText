Indonesian athletes got a morale boost from President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before they left for the 15th Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, on Dec. 1-15.

Indonesia is sending a total of 219 people -- 131 athletes, 36 coaches, 17 team managers, six mechanics, six officials and 23 cooks -- to the Dec. 1-15 event.

The athletes will compete in 84 events from 20 sports, The Jakarta Post newspaper reported Thursday.

"You athletes are those who have been selected, groomed and are experienced after many competitions in and out of the country. So compete and fight for the best," the President was quoted as telling the athletes during a ceremony Wednesday.

The country is hoping to earn at least four gold medals from badminton, bowling, karate, taekwondo, cycling and sailing.

State Minister for Youth and Sports Adhyaksa Dault said many of the athletes had trained in Thailand and Switzerland and their progress had been closely monitored by a government team.

Adhyaksa said he considered the official target of a minimum of four golds as "too pessimistic".

"We can win more than that... at least eight golds from badminton, karate and bowling," he said.

The Asiad would also serve as a training ground for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, he said.
