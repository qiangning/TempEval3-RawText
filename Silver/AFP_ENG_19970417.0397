The trial of a group of Bosnian Moslems dubbed "The Zvornik Seven" accused of murdering four Serbs began Thursday with a senior international mediator dismissing it as a "travesty of justice" because defence lawyers had been barred from the court.

Deputy High Representative Michael Steiner said the trial of the seven, who were arrested in May last year, was unconstitutional because Serb officials had refused to let the defence lawyers for the Moslems into the court Thursday morning to represent their clients.

"This trial can only be judged to be a travesty of justice," said Steiner, adding that the case could result in sanctions against the Serbs.

"This is one typical case to which we must refer when the (Serb Republic) complains about getting less financial assistance than" the Moslem-Croat Federation, the other entity that makes up post-war Bosnia.

Bosnian Serb justice minister, Branko Petric, announced on Monday that the lawyers would be barred from the court because they came from the federation, and hence were not subjects of the Serb Republic.

The lawyers were told they could act only as "assistants" to court- appointed lawyers.

But Steiner said that in banning the officials, Petric had "violated the constitution of Bosnia-Hercegovina."

The trial opened in the eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik, in Serb- controlled territory, which was the scene of some of the most brutal "ethnic cleansing" of non-Serbs during Bosnia's 43-month war.

The case of the Zvornik Seven has mystified observers ever since the men turned themselves in to US peacekeepers last May after running into a group of Serbs on the road between Zvornik and Tuzla, in the Moslem-Croat Federation.

The men told the troops they were Moslem refugees from the former enclave of Srebrenica and asked for protective custody, but the US commander handed them to the Serb police.

A US colonel later failed to secure the men's release from a Serb jail, and UN officals said the men were beaten by their Serb captors.

The Serb authorities allege that the men killed four Serb woodcutters, whose mutilated bodies were shown to UN investigators soon afterwards in a forest nearby.

Some of the men were found to be on a list of thousands of persons who went missing from Srebrenica after Bosnian Serb forces overran it in July 1995. Most of the missing are believed to have been massacred.

Three of the men are charged with the murders of the four woodcutters, one is charged with murdering a Moslem person, and the remaining three are charged with illegal possession of weapons.
