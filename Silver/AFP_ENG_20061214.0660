Wall Street's main indexes leapt to fresh highs Thursday as investors appeared encouraged by the latest economic news and shook off a jump in oil prices.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a new all-time record closing high with a gain of 96.46 points (0.78 percent) to 12,413.96 at the closing bell.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite meanwhile climbed 21.44 points (0.88 percent) to 2,453.85, its highest level since February 2001. The Standard and Poor's 500 advanced 11.95 points (0.85 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,425.16, a new six-year high for the broad-market index.

In economic news, the US Labor Department reported weekly jobless claims fell 20,000 to 304,000 in the past week, the latest in a string of stronger-than-expected data.

While this highlighted concerns about a tight labor market and inflation, it also suggested economic growth is not faltering.

"The two straight weeks of nice declines reinforces the belief that companies are holding on to employees in anticipation of an economic rebound, despite recent numbers showing a slowdown in activity," said John Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Keegan.
