Fifty schools in Thailand's insurgency-plagued southern border province Narathiwat reopened Wednesday following a one-week closure after a local woman teacher was shot dead last week.

Thai News Agency reported that the majority of the 62 schools in Ruso and Srisakorn districts of Narathiwat reopened Wednesday morning, except a few schools including the Lamoh School, where the female victim Kulthida Injumpha had worked as an assistant school principal. The thirty-three-year old teacher was gunned down by a suspected insurgent while she was on her way home on November 15.

Though most schools have reopened Wednesday, only less than half the enrolled students came to classes. In Ruso district, of 186 students enrolled at Sawo school, only 50 students turned up at school, presumably because most students and parents didn't know that the school had reopened.

Meanwhile in nearby province Yala, over 30 schools in Yaha district were closed Wednesday with no schedule for reopening as teachers fear that local people would take them hostages, according to news network The Nation.

Somchai Ronglua, deputy director of Yala's Education Zone II, was quoted as saying that teachers feared for their safety after local villagers protested on Tuesday to pressure border patrol police and troops to pull out from their temporary bases in two schools in the district.

Somchai said although most of the protesting villagers dispersed, teachers believed that they were still dissatisfied so they could stage violent protests, including holding teacher hostages.

He said teachers would not resume teaching until the situation got improved or the authorities could guarantee their safety.

Insurgency-related violence has been on the rise in recent weeks in the three southern border provinces Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani, where over 1,700 people have been killed in the past three years.
