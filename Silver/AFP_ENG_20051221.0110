A reshuffled Pakistan team restricted a struggling England to 206-9 in the fifth and final day-night limited overs international at Pindi cricket stadium here on Wednesday.

Vikram Solanki top-scored with 49 while Andrew Flintoff (39) and Paul Collingwood (33) were other notable contributors after England won the toss and decided to bat on a slow pitch which assisted spin.

England have already lost the five-match series 3-1 and were playing for pride and for an opportunity to improve their international one-day rankings.

Marcus Trescothick, leading England in the absence of the injured Michael Vaughan, continued his run of poor form. He played on to debutant Mohammad Asif in the second over after scoring just one.

Asif, who turned 23 on Tuesday and was one of three changes Pakistan made to rest their players, then accounted for Matthew Prior (nine) in his third over as the batsman flicked straight into the hands of square-leg.

England had crawled to 52 by the 18th over as their batsmen found the going tough against some tight Pakistan bowling, especially by the spinners.

Off-spinner Arshad Khan deceived Andrew Strauss in the air and had him stumped by wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal for 26, leaving England struggling on 52-3.

Solanki steadied the faltering innings with a 65-run fourth wicket stand with Flintoff, before he miscued a drive off leg-spinner Shahid Afridi and was caught in the covers. He hit six boundaries during his 86-ball knock.

Naved-ul-Hasan then claimed Flintoff and Ian Blackwell off successive deliveries before Geraint Jones (three) and Collingwood further added to the tourists' misery with sloppy run outs.

Flintoff, who played only as a batsman due to a sore ankle, hit three boundaries and a six in his 73-ball knock.

In a late-order charge Liam Plunkett hit three boundaries and a six in his 12-ball 24 to take England past 200.

Asif finished with 2-14 off seven overs before being surprisingly replaced by super-sub Danish Kaneria.

Pakistan rested their captain Inzamam-ul-Haq after he strained his groin during Pakistan's 13-run win in the fourth match here on Monday.

Younis Khan, who led Pakistan to victory against the West Indies in his only one-day match as captain early this year, took over the captaincy. Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami (both rested) made way for Asif and Yasir Hameed.

England were forced to omit Kabir Ali, who hurt his back in practice, and batsman Ian Bell. But bowling spearhead Steve Harmison returned after missing Monday's match with sore throat and flu.

Off-spinner Shaun Udal was brought in for batsman Bell.
