Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Tuesday that clear progress has been achieved over the operation of the Rafah crossing on the Gaza-Egypt border.

"It is agreed that Palestinians who carry Palestinian ID cards can cross the Rafah crossing in both directions without any conditions," Erekat told Palestinian radio "Voice of Palestine."

The agreement was made at an Israeli-Palestinian-European meeting held on Monday night, which was also attended by James Wolfensohn, the Quartet Committee envoy, he said.

"We also agreed on transporting goods abroad via Rafah," Erekat said, adding that goods into the Gaza strip will be transported through the Kerem Shalom crossing.

Israel's security cabinet approved last week an agreement with Egypt to reopen the Rafah crossing under the supervision of European inspectors.

However, Israelis and the Palestinians are at odds over the role of the European inspectors as the Palestinians consider them advisers while Israel wants them to have veto power over security enforcement.

Erekat said more three-party meetings are scheduled in the coming days to discuss the inspectors' role and the installation of observation cameras at the crossing, another outstanding dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.

Meanwhile, Palestinian Chief of Crossings Nazmi Mhanna announced that Rafah will be open for 24 hours for Palestinians as of Tuesday midnight.

The Rafah crossing, the only exit of Gaza to the outside world, was shut down for security reasons shortly before Israel completed withdrawing settlers and troops from the coastal strip in September.
