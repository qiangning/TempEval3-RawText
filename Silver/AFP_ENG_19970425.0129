Ceasefire talks between Moslem guerrillas and the Philippine government have stalled here with both sides agreeing to meet again next month, officials said Friday.

The two-day talks which ended Thursday are aimed at forging a truce with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the country's last remaining major Moslem guerrilla group, to allow negotiations on a political settlement to the civil war to begin.

The two sides scrapped a scheduled news conference Friday after failing to agree on the wording of a joint communique, but agreed to meet again at a Roman Catholic university here on May 13-14 to try to break the impasse.

The MILF, founded in 1978 and which commands around 10,000 guerrillas, wants a ceasefire agreement in place throughout the country's south, known as the Mindanao region, with its forces being allowed to maintain their current positions.

Before any Mindanao-wide truce, the government first wants to put to paper a three-month-old informal truce around the guerrilla stronghold of Buldon, where 4,000 Army units and an equal number of MILF guerrillas are locked in a standoff that has claimed around 60 lives this year.

"We failed to reach further understanding on the positioning of troops in Buldon but we will discuss it further," the chief ceasefire negotiator for the government, Major General Joselin Nazareno, told AFP.

The two sides discussed a "repositioning of forces" in Buldon, "and it was there unfortunately, (that) we failed to reach any agreement."

The rebel panel's legal counsel, Lanang Ali, confirmed the impasse, saying: "We could not agree on the specific (disposition) of our forces in Buldon. We wanted one thing, the (government panel) wanted another thing. Even on compromise, we failed to agree."

As negotiators prepared for this week's talks, an Army spokesman said an MILF unit ambushed a military-escorted crew of a road construction project near the town of Aliosan on Monday, killing one soldier and wounding another.

The attack forced around 2,000 villagers to flee, Captain Noel Detoyato told AFP.

The military deployed a Marine battalion and a "Rapid Deployment Force" of the Army in the area on Wednesday, he added.

The MILF is a splinter of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which last year signed a peace treaty with the government to end a 24-year guerrilla campaign aimed at setting up a separate Moslem state in the country's south.

The MILF, which had refused to join the negotiations, was left out in the political settlement, which installed MNLF chief Nur Misuari as the chief overseer of development funds which the government pledged to pour into Mindanao.

President Fidel Ramos' government believes a peace settlement with the MILF would solve rampant crime in Mindanao, perpetrated by rogue guerrilla units who kidnap local businessmen for ransom, and improve the region's attraction as an investment site.
