The linkages between sport, peace and the environment will be the main focus at the Sixth World Conference on Sport and Environment to be held in Nairobi from November 9 to 11, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) said here Tuesday.

The conference, one of the key activities under UNEP's long term strategy on sport and environment, will be attended by 300 heads of National Olympic Committees, international sport organizations, UN agencies as well as sport stars, according to a UNEP statement.

The three-day meeting, organized by the International Olympic Committee and UNEP, will review the environmental activities of the Olympic Movement and other sport stakeholders. Within the course of the conference the participants will take part in panel discussion on key themes relating to sports, peace, environment and sustainable development.

This edition follows on from the one held in Turin, Italy, in December 2003, where delegates from all five continents shared experiences and ideas on sustainable development in and through sport, and how it could be better promoted and achieved.
