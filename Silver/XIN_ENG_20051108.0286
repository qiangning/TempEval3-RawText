The spokesman of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Nabil Abu Rudeineh accused Israel on Tuesday evening for trying to blowup the situations in the region.

Abu Rudeineh's accusation came in response to earlier statements made by Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lieutenant Dan Halutz who said that Israel will continue its targeted killing against Islamic Jihad militants in the Gaza Strip.

Abu Rudeineh told reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah that the PNA will never allow any attempt that aim at hindering holding the parliament elections set for Jan. 25, 2006.

He added that "the PNA will not allow any side to destroy its efforts that are spent preparing for the coming parliament elections."

Abu Rudeineh, meanwhile, demanded the Israeli government to stop its policies represented by incursions, assassinations and arrests against the Palestinian citizens.

He also demanded the Israeli government to offer help for the PNA in guaranteeing positive atmospheres for the hold of fair Palestinian elections.

Halutz made the statements earlier in the day while briefing the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Israeli Knesset ( parliament) on the security situations in the region.

He said that the policy of targeted killing against Palestinian militants has proven to be extremely effective in restricting Palestinian militants' terror activities.

Targeting the Islamic Jihad members will continue in the Gaza Strip even after the Israeli army had pulled out from the strip, he added.
