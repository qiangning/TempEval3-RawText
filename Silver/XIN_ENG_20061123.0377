Mohamed ElBaradei, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on Thursday welcomed the positive signals sent by relevant parties about the resumption of talks on the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula.

In an address to the Board of Governors of IAEA, ElBaradei said that the nuclear weapon test launched last month by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) underscored "the importance and urgency of finding a negotiated solution to the current situation regarding the DPRK's nuclear program."

"The resumption of dialogue between all concerned parties is indispensable and urgent," he added.

He also stressed that the DPRK's test was "a matter of deep regret and concern" and constituted a "serious challenge" to the current international nuclear non-proliferation regime.

At present, he noted, the IAEA stood ready to work with the DPRK and all concerned parties toward a solution to assure the international community that all nuclear activities in the DPRK would be "exclusively for peaceful purposes."

As to Iran's nuclear issue, ElBaradei said that due to Iran's limited cooperation with IAEA, the IAEA was unable to move forward in its efforts to confirm the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran.

He described Iran's recent decision to allow IAEA experts to inspect two nuclear sites as "steps in the right direction."

The IAEA chief expressed his hope that through dialogue between Iran and its partners, conditions would be created to achieve a comprehensive solution that addresses the respective concerns of all parties.

At Thursday's meeting, the IAEA Board of Governors decided that it would temporarily not provide technical assistance to Iran's Arak heavy water nuclear reactor program.

Christopher Hill, U.S. assistant secretary of state, said on Tuesday after a whirlwind one-day visit to Beijing that he believed the six-party talks dedicated to resolving the unclear issue on the Korean Peninsula would probably resume in mid-December.

The six-party talks, launched in 2003, were suspended last November when Pyongyang walked out in protest against financial sanctions imposed by Washington.

After carrying out a nuclear test on Oct. 9, the DPRK government agreed to return to the talks which also involve China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States, but did not say a specific date.
