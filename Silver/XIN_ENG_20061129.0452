The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would open a liaison office in Belgrade in mid December, a senior Serbian official said here on Wednesday.

"The opening of the NATO liaison office in Belgrade is doubly important in the sphere of multilateral cooperation, exchange of experiences and better mutual communication and understanding," said Snezana Samardzic-Markovic, Serbian assistant defense minister for the defense policy.

Samardzic-Markovic told the press that the Serbian government has decided to open this office and that it was offered to NATO officials that this office is located in the Defense Ministry.

Early on Wednesday, NATO's heads of state decided at a summit in Riga to invite Serbia to join the Partnership for Peace program along with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro.

The Partnership for Peace, which was created by NATO in 1994, was a program designed to facilitate cooperation with partner countries to extend the zone of peace and stability in Europe.

According to the official Tanjug news agency, NATO plans to open its office in Belgrade probably on Dec. 19.

The opening ceremony will be attended by high NATO officials headed by its Deputy Secretary-General Alessandro Minuto Rizzo, the news agency reported, citing diplomatic sources.
