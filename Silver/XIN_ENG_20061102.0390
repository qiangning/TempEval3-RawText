Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen 's visit to China from Oct. 29 to Nov. 2 was fruitful and would promote the friendly cooperative ties between China and ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asia Nations), especially those between China and Cambodia, according to a local media's report on Friday.

Hor Namhong, Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, told local reporters at a press conference at the Phnom Penh International Airport on Thursday after the prime minister's return.

During the summit held in Naning, Guangxi, to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the dialogue ties between China and ASEAN, Hun Sen proposed to build cooperative partnership between both sides, which would greatly promote the friendly cooperation between China and ASEAN, especially that between China and Cambodia.

Such cooperation would bring benefits to Cambodia's social and economic developments and help the kingdom narrow its difference with other member countries of ASEAN, he said.

In a joint declaration of the summit, Hor said, Hun Sen provided some complementary opinion for China to accomplish the Singapore-Kunming Railway as soon as possible, so as to supplement the current rail lines connecting Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia.

In addition, the prime minister asked China to offer loans for Cambodian to construct a railway leading to Vietnam, thus enabling the kingdom to transport more commodities to China via Vietnam, he added.

Hun Sen returned to Phnom Penh on Thursday afternoon. During his trip to China, he also visited Shandong Province in order to tap experience of economic development.
