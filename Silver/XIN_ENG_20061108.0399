Ecuador's President Alfredo Palacio on Wednesday denounced Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's "interference" in Ecuador's presidential elections.

"This is unacceptable. There cannot be such outside interference," said Palacio, referring to Chavez's remarks that banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa used his vast wealth to exert influence in the elections.

Noboa finished first "in a somewhat strange fashion" in the first round, Chavez told foreign correspondents in Caracas on Wednesday. "He showed up in the first place and started spreading money around all over the place."

Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Francisco Carrion said he had summoned Venezuelan Ambassador to Ecuador, Oscar Navas, on Wednesday morning to lodge a complaint about Chavez's comments.

After the meeting, Navas told reporters that "there is no interference" as Chavez "said nothing against the Ecuadorean government."

According to Ecuadorian law, a candidate needs 50 percent, or at least 40 percent and a 10-percentage-point lead over the rest of the field, to avoid a runoff.

As the Oct. 15 Ecuadorian elections failed to produce an outright winner, Noboa and Rafael Correa, a leftist candidate favored by Chavez, will face each other in a runoff on Nov. 26.
