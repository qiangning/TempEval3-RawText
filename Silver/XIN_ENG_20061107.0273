The Chinese Kuomintang Party (KMT) and the People First Party on Tuesday put forward their own bills, respectively, for Friday's session of Taiwan's "legislative yuan", to oust Chen Shui-bian who has been implicated in corruption, according to reports by Taiwan media.

It has been the third such bill ever since Chen's family came under fire for alleged involvement in corruption early this year.

But the Democratic Progress Party (DPP) said all its members will not participate in the legislative meeting to cast their votes, same to what it did during the two previous votings.

The previous anti-Chen votings failed to succeed, due to the opposition by the DPP and the abstaining by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).
