Outgoing Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari on Monday defended his 10-month record in government, just three days before a general election that could see him lose the top cabinet job.

Jaafari, who has been criticised by rivals for a weak administration that has failed to quell violence, said his mandate had improved Iraq's security services and enshrined the principle of a peaceful change of power.

"Despite the short mandate which has been our lot, with God's help we have had security, economic and political successes," said the premier, a devout Shiite and leader of the Dawa party.

Jaafari was sworn in last May. His predecessor as interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi, has accused the current administration of exacerbating sectarian divisions and marching the country to the brink of civil war.

"Praise be to God, Iraq is today stronger after overcoming so many obstacles," said Jaafari, recalling 35 years of political and economic instability, and international isolation under former dictator Saddam Hussein.

"We inherited a difficult situation with disorganised security services and we have now completed two-thirds of our objectives for the manning and equipment of these forces," he told a Baghdad news conference.

"On the political level, the principle of a peaceful transfer of power has become a reality and we are ready to re-assume power if that is what the people decide," he said.

His government created 59,000 jobs in the education ministry alone and brought back 4,000 staff to their former positions at the information ministry, Jaafari said before expressing hopes for a peaceful election on Thursday.

In a direct response to complaints from Allawi against institutional abuses among Shiite-dominated security forces and torture in prisons, Jaafari pointed the finger at his secular rival.

"The towns of Fallujah and Najaf continue to bleed from the effects of actions" taken by Allawi's administration.

As prime minister from June 2004 to April 2005, Allawi's unflinching support for US military campaigns against Sunni and Shiite insurgents in Fallujah and Najaf left him few friends in those cities.

Jaafari also hit out against accusations of human rights abuses and pointed out that he had brought Sunnis into his government saying "Iraq can only rebuild itself with their participation.

"The new Iraq excludes none of its sons.

"My government avoided any sectarianism," he concluded.
