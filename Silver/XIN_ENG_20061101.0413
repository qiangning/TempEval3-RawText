One week before next Tuesday's midterm Congressional elections, Iraq and terrorism top the list of issues that American voters consider "extremely important," a new poll released on Wednesday showed.

The CNN poll, conducted from Friday through Sunday, found that 49 percent of those surveyed said they consider Iraq "extremely important" in deciding how to vote.

Terrorism followed closely, at 46 percent, and the third-biggest issue was ethics in government, with 37 percent of respondents saying they consider it extremely important.

The importance of economy dropped in the poll, which found only 33 percent of those canvassed said it was important in their decision how to vote.

The poll of 837 registered voters had a margin of sampling error at plus or minus three percentage points.

Another poll released on Wednesday suggested that Democrats continued to have a significant advantage heading into the midterms.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that Democrats held a 15-point lead over Republicans in voters' preference for control of Congress - 52 percent against 37 percent. President George W. Bush's approval rating remained below 40 percent.

The poll, which was taken of 1,010 registered voters from Friday through Monday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, also found more than 60 percent of those respondents felt less confident that the war in Iraq would come to a successful conclusion.
