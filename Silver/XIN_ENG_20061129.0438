A summit between U.S. President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was put off until Thursday, local media reported on Wednesday.

The postponement was announced shortly after Bush arrived in Jordan Wednesday evening for talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II and al-Maliki.

Bush and al-Maliki are expected to discuss the worsening security situation and ways to stem mounting violence in the war- torn country.

The Bush-Abdullah II meeting will proceed as scheduled.
