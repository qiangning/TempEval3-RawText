Any violence in Kosovo could derail the nearly completed process to give the UN-administered province a new status, a senior US diplomat warned on Monday.

"We want to reiterate our desire to see this process, which is now in the concluding stages, completed without delay," US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo told local reporters.

"To do so, we all need to ensure that the people of Kosovo move forward according to the terms set by the process, that there will be no violence which will hurt considerably the aspiration of the people of Kosovo to see this process to conclusion."

Special UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari is expected to reveal his proposal early next year on the future status of Kosovo, whose ethnic-Albanian majority is seeking independence from Serbia, a demand Belgrade strongly opposes.

The UN-run province remains tense more than seven years since the end of its 1998-1999 conflict between Serbian forces and separatist ethnic Albanian guerillas.

Frustrations over the wait for determining Kosovo's status have occasionally turned violent among ethnic Albanians, who comprise around 90 percent of the province's two million population.

"Unilateral actions will be counterproductive," said the EU representative to the Kosovo talks, Stephan Lehne.

"You have to show the maturity and commitment to help the international community partnership with you to bring this process to its essential conclusion," said Lehne.

DiCarlo and Lehne made the statements after meeting with Kosovo Albanian leaders and their negotiating team.
