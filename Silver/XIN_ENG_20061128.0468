A gold mine collapse in northern Colombia on Tuesday trapped 15 miners, rescue workers told media.

The accident took place in Barranco de Loba, in the Caribbean coast province of Bolivar, which has been suffering heavy rains this week.

The town's mayor, Victor Vasquez, told media that rescuers are supplying oxygen to the trapped miners through a hole on the ground while trying to dig them out. Local residents said that the mine has met basic security standards.

A similar collapse trapped four gold miners in Remedios, a town in the northeastern Antioquia province. The miners were rescued alive after five days. They were able to breathe, but were forced to drink their own urine due to the lack of water.
