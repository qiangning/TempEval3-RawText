UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday welcomed the resumption of peace talks in Nigeria between the Sudanese government and rebel groups in western Sudan' s Darfur region.

With the mediation of the African Union, Khartoum and the two rebel groups -- the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement -- started the long-delayed seventh round of peace talks in the Nigerian capital of Abuja earlier in the day.

"The secretary-general strongly appeals to the parties to the Abuja peace process ... to immediately stop all violence and atrocities on the ground," said a statement issued by UN spokesman Stephanie Dujarric.

"He calls on the parties to negotiate a just and comprehensive peace agreement. Individual leaders will be judged on their immediate action to stop the bloodshed in Darfur," the statement said.

The secretary-general urged the parties to the conflict and all other armed groups in Darfur to cooperate fully with the African Union Mission in Sudan and with the United Nations Mission in Sudan.

Annan also appealed to donors to continue supporting both the crucial work of the AU mission in this long suffering region and critical humanitarian assistance for millions of war-affected civilians in Darfur, the statement said.
