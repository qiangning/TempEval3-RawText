Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah said the new Israeli Labour leader Amir Peretz may help unite Israel's "peace camp" and promote talks with the Palestinians, the official Saudi Press Agency reported on Monday.

"The emergence of Amir Peretz as the leader of the Israeli Labour party may pave the way for a breakthrough and lead to unification of the dispersed peace camp in Israel," SPA quoted Abdullah as saying.

Peretz emerged as the winner during a leadership election on Nov. 9, replacing the veteran Labor chief Shimon Peres.

Peretz, who had promised to pull Labour out of a coalition government headed by Ariel Sharon, pledged to restart talks with Palestinians if Labour wins parliamentary elections in March.
