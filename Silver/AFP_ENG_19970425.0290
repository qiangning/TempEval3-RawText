Albanian President Sali Berisha on Friday appointed a new head for the country's central bank, which has been without a governor for two months, a presidential spokesman told AFP.

Qamil Tusha, 40, will replace Kristaq Luniku, who left Albania two months ago for the United States, a Tusha aide said.

Tusha was previously deputy director of the Albanian Trade Bank, a state institution. According to opposition Socialist newspapers, Tusha is a close associate of Berisha.

Luniku, 35, had warned of the dangers of pyramid schemes -- the bogus savings schemes whose collapse sparked widespread unrest in January that developed into a full-scale insurgency.

According to the Albanian press, he went to the United States to take up a post as adviser to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
