Malawi's Constitutional Court sitting in Blantyre was on Monday a source of bad news for President Bingu wa Mutharika and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as it threw out his plea for appeal in the Section 65 referral case, Nation Online of Malawi reported on Tuesday.

Mutharika was asking the court for a chance to appeal against its interpretation made two weeks ago of the controversial Section 65 of the Constitution that does not allow lawmakers to cross the floor in Parliament.

The ruling effectively leaves about 85 members of parliament ( MPs) in the line of fire as the speaker of parliament can now unleash the constitutional provision on those legislators deemed to have crossed the floor.

The three-man panel of judges--comprising Healey Potani, Edward Twea and Frank Kapanda--told the packed court that after examining the affidavit sworn by Solicitor-General Alexander Maluza, it found that the plea for appeal had no basis.

"The decision by the speaker will depend on the facts before him. MPs have the right to come to the court on their own right, according to Section 63, part 3 of the Constitution," said Twea, who delivered the 10-minute ruling on behalf of his colleagues.

Twea said Mutharika's argument that the application for the appeal would help avoid unnecessary costs--if by-elections are held following the speaker's decision to invoke the section-- lacked merit and that it only served to show that the president lacks confidence in the court.

"The court, therefore, denies the stay...This application must fail in its totality," said Twea.

Just as the judges went backdoor, cheers of jubilation by opposition members, notably from the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and the United Democratic Front (UDF), spiced by hand-clapping and waving, filled the court room, according to the report.

Two weeks ago the constitutional court ruled that the parliamentary speaker could declare scores of disputed seats vacant, making possible ouster of President wa Mutharika.

The Constitutional Court sitting in Blantyre said Section 65 of the Constitution is valid and not inconsistent with other provisions of the Constitution. This means the Speaker of Parliament Louis Chimango can now make his ruling on petitions by the opposition UDF and MCP to declare seats of some MPs vacant, arguing they had crossed the floor according to the parties' understanding of Section 65 (1) of the Constitution.

Wa Mutharika's ruling party stands to lose 70 members of parliament in the 139-seat assembly following the ruling on seats occupied by defecting MPs, who defected from the then ruling UDF last year to join the DPP, enabling it to become the governing party.
