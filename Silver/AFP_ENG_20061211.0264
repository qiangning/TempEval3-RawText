Four members of Bangladesh's interim government quit on Monday in protest at the president's decision to deploy the army to restore order ahead of January's elections.

The resignations came despite assurances from President Iajuddin Ahmed that calling in the military would not harm the democratic process in the country, paralysed for weeks by opposition protests and bloody clashes.

"We have sent our resignation letter to the president, because we think that no situation has been created in the country that warranted an army deployment," interim cabinet member Sultana Kamal said.

The president ordered the deployment late on Saturday in a bid to restore order and counter opposition threats to conduct non-stop protests to force electoral reforms.

The opposition, led by the Awami League, have alleged the January 23 polls will be rigged in favour of the outgoing Bangladesh National Party (BNP).

At least 34 people have also died in pre-election violence in the impoverished and politically polarised south Asian nation.

Kamal said all the president's 10 advisors, or cabinet members, had opposed the president's move to deploy the armed forces.

"But he did not care," she said. "The deployment of the army is against the democratic process ... it can provoke the political parties and create obstacles to holding a free and fair election."

The four cabinet members who quit included a former army chief, a former senior bureaucrat, a former foreign secretary and a human rights lawyer.

"The resignation of four advisers proves that a free and neutral election is impossible under President Iajuddin Ahmed," said senior Awami League official Tofail Ahmed.

"The president has been serving the outgoing Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). I think unless he is removed as the head the caretaker government, we can not expect free and fair elections."

The opposition, meanwhile, vowed its protests would continue, even as thousands of troops fanned out across the capital and the country.

"We will hold protest rallies to press our demand for creating a level-playing field for the upcoming elections," opposition spokesman Abdul Jalil said.

"We will continue our movement until the caretaker government implements all our demands."

Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said Sunday that the situation in the country did not warrant the army's deployment.

But in a televised speech to the nation late Sunday, the president sought to justify his move by saying the armed forces had been deployed by previous governments.

He also said he merely wanted to "ensure security and to create a congenial and peaceful atmosphere".

Soldiers have been deployed in Dhaka -- particularly around the presidential palace -- as well as in all districts and towns and the nation's ports.

"So far we have deployed nearly 16,000 army troops, 1,000 navy and 500 airforce personnel," armed forces spokesman, Colonel Anisur Rahman, told AFP.

"If the situation demands, the troops will move to sub-district towns," he said.

British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury said the resignations would create uncertainty in the present political situation ahead of next month's general election, according to the private UNB news agency.

"The resignation is unexpected. This is not a good development," he told reporters.

Analyst Ataur Rahman, a professor of political science in Dhaka University, said the walk-out was a "major blow" to the interim government.

"It opens up a serious crack in the country's caretaker government system. It deepens the country's political crisis and now raises questions about the democratic process," he said.
