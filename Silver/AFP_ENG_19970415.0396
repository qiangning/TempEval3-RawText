A top-level Mauritian delegation to China has signed two agreements pertaining to the future Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, officials said here Tuesday.

One accord waives visa requirements for Mauritians traveling to Hong Kong after the territory reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, and for Chinese citizens travelling to Mauritius.

It was signed in the presence of the Chinese and Mauritian premiers, Li Peng and Navin Ramgoolam, by Mauritian Cabinet Secretary Philippe Yan Sin and Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Tang Xiaxuan.

China has also agreed to provide aid totalling five million yuan (600,000 dollars) to Mauritius, and trade officials signed a cooperation agreement.

Ramgoolam, who met Monday with Li, was due to meet Tuesday with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
