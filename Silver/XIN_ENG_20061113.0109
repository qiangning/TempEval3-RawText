Malaysia's Industrial Production Index (IPI) for September rose by 3.6 percent to 136.8 on a year-on-year basis, the Department of Statistics said Monday.

The positive growth was driven by the increases in the manufacturing and electricity indices, which grew by 5.9 percent to 143.7 and by 4.2 percent to 154.3 respectively.

The mining index, however, declined by 5 percent to 111.3, the department said in a statement released here.

Compared with the previous month, IPI for September decreased by 1 percent.

The decrease was due to the lower indices in all sectors, with the electricity index down 3 percent, mining index down 2.7 percent and manufacturing index, down 0.4 percent.

For the third quarter this year, the IPI rose by 5 percent to 137.2 compared with the same period last year.

From January to September 2006, the IPI surged by 5.6 percent to 133.7 as compared with the same period last year.

The IPI is the measure of the rate of change in the production of industrial commodities in real terms over time. These commodities are obtained from the manufacturing, mining and electricity sectors.
