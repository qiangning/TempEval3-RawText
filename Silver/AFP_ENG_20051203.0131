African leaders and French President Jacques Chirac opened a two-day summit here on Saturday, aimed at tackling the problems of Africa's youth, but the continent's conflicts and combatting immimgration were also likely to top the agenda.

All 53 African states are represented at the biennial gathering, a Malian organising committee official said, in a first for the Africa-France summits since they began in 1973.

As well as Chirac, about 20 heads of state and government, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and recently re-elected Omar Bongo Ondimba of Gabon were present at the opening.

Mali President Amadou Toumani Toure opened the summit, which began about an hour behind schedule at the specially-extended congress hall in the Malian capital, Bamako.

He called for a meeting between European and African nations on how to tackle immigration, highlighting the need to combat trafficking networks.

"We have to keep young people here at home," he said.

He was to be followed later by 73-year-old Chirac, who on his arrival late Friday called for greater international effort for development. He also said Africa's youth predominantly wanted peace and democracy.

The theme of the discussions, which include three closed-door sessions over the two days and continue until about midday on Sunday, is 'African youth, its vitality, its creativity, their hopes'.
