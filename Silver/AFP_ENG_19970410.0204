NASA has decided to delay the launch of a future international space station for one year and needs an extra 200 million dollars to replace a key Russian component that has fallen behind.

The new target date for the first launch is "no later than October 1998," NASA Space Flight Director Wilbur Trafton told the space subcommittee of the House of Representatives on Wednesday.

The additional 200 million dollars to build a backup for the missing Russian service module, he said, will come from the US shuttle program, but a decision to build the substitute component will not be made until mid-May.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had planned to launch the first module of the 43 billion dollar space station Alpha in November of this year.

But the first sign the project would have to be delayed came in February when the Russian space agency announced it was postponing the launch of its part of the station for six or seven months.

The Russian "cargo" module was going to transport construction equipment to build the international station, a project between Russia, the United States, Japan and several European countries.

Committee members were angered by Trafton's announcement. Republican representative Dana Rohrabacher called Russian officials "dunderheads" and "nincompoops" for causing the year-long delay.

The lawmakers were also displeased at Trafton's plan to transfer money from the shuttle program for Alpha's component, but the NASA official explained that it was necessary to avoid further delays.

"To keep from shutting down the program today we need some additional funds today," Trafton said. "For the lack of 200 million today, we could end up costing ourselves several hundred million down the road."
