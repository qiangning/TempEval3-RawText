The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill arrived here Monday afternoon to continue efforts on resuming the six-party talks on the Korean Peninsular nuclear issue.

Just a week ago, Hill came to the Chinese capital and met with vice foreign minister Wu Dawei. The two agreed to make joint efforts for the restart of the talks.
