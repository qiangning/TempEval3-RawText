The UN Environment Program (UNEP) Executive Director Achim Steiner has expressed appreciation for what China has done in dealing with climate change and advised the largest developing country in the world to do more in this field.

"It is rapidly gaining pace. There is steward awareness among Chinese leadership, particularly those who are looking at future economic development power of China," he told Xinhua Wednesday during a major United Nations climate change meeting being held here.

Steiner suggested that China exert more efforts in power generation in the future and public transport.

"I know the leadership in China, with international collaboration, is looking at how the power, the electricity that is needed in the future can be generated," he said.

The UNEP chief also advised the Chinese government to work out a plan to manage the public transport as China has seen a rapid growth of private vehicles in the past years.

Steiner also pointed out that forestation and efficient management of lands could help China register sustainable development.

China, which has sent a delegation led by senior officials and diplomats to the climate change conference, is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emission through global efforts to curb the trend of adverse climate change.

The UN conference on climate change kicked off on Monday, with participating parties exploring an international framework to deal with the issue of global warming after 2012, the last year covered by the current gas emission rules under the Kyoto Protocol.
