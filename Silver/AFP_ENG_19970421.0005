Fresh violence between supporters of rival political parties erupted in four separate towns in Java province at the weekend injuring at least 20 people, party officials and reports said Monday.

In Solo, PPP supporters clashed with security members on Saturday, leaving at least 20 people injured while in nearby Klaten, a Golkar convoy was pelted by stones by pro-PPP villagers on Sunday, the Media Indonesia daily said.

In Temanggung district, southeast of Pekalongan, a convoy of PPP supporters clashed with members of two youth groups affiliated with the ruling Golkar party on Sunday, another PPP official there said.

In Pekalongan a town on the province's coast rocked by political violence since March, a mob damaged a government office in the early hours of Sunday but there were no casualties, an official of the Moslem-led United Development Party (PPP) said.

"It is the people, our supporters, not PPP members, who attacked the district assistant's office," the deputy chairman of the Pekalongan PPP chapter Nursianto (Eds: one name) said by telephone.

Hundreds of people, mostly riding motorcycles, attacked the office, 11 kilometres (7 miles) west of Pekalongan in the early hours, pelting it with stones, breaking window panes and doors, the Jayakarta daily said.

The daily said the mob had been part of a larger one which had toured the town in vehicles, yelling pro-PPP slogans, after attending a prayer session late on Saturday.

"There have been reports of arrests but I have not been able to confirm them," Nursianto.

The Pekalongan police declined comment saying the situation was "under control" and "calm."

In a separate incident, a rowdy convoy of PPP supporters returning from a party meeting in Ambarawa in the Semarang district was pelted with stones in the Kaloran sub-district of neighbouring Temanggung on Sunday.

Temanggung PPP chapter spokesman Parjiono (Eds: one name), said the attack was by members of two youth groups affiliated to Golkar.

PPP supporters on motorcycles toured the area around Solo on Saturday clashing with security members after they attempted to break through a security barricade in town.

Violence has swept several Java towns in the past month, much of it connected to rivalry between the PPP and President Suharto's Golkar party, ahead of the general elections on May 29 with campaigning due to start on April 27.

Indonesia's three official political parties -- Golkar, the PPP and the Indonesian Democracy Party (PDI) -- are contesting the May 29 parliamentary election.

Golkar has been widely criticised for using government facilities and officials to gain support in general elections.

The country's six million civil servants are ordered to vote for Golkar, with pressure also applied on their wives, husbands and children to vote for the ruling party.
