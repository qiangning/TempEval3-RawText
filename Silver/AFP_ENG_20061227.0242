An aide to the British commander of NATO troops in Afghanistan was sent Wednesday for trial at the Old Bailey, accused of passing secrets to "the enemy" -- believed to be Iran, officials said.

Corporal Daniel James, an interpreter to Lieutenant General David Richards, has been charged under the Official Secrets Act with "prejudicing the safety of the state."

The 44-year-old, who first appeared before magistrates last week, was back in court on Wednesday -- and judge Timothy Workman set a date of January 12 for a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey, England's central criminal court.

The charge alleges that on November 2 this year, he "communicated to another person information calculated to be, or that might be, or intended to be directly or indirectly useful to the enemy."

James' boss Richards is head of NATO's more than 30,000-strong International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

James, who lives in the southern English resort town of Brighton, is of Iranian descent and speaks fluent Pashtun, one of the main languages in Afghanistan, according to The Daily Telegraph newspaper.

At last Wednesday's initial case the judge ordered reporters out for much of the proceedings because of possible prejudice to national security, and remanded him in custody over the Christmas break.

According to The Guardian newspaper, the court ruled that there was a substantial risk of further "communications" between James and "a foreign power", and he might be "extracted" from British jurisdiction if granted bail.

The court case comes as British-led forces struggle against fiercer than expected Taliban insurgents in the south of Afghanistan, invaded by US-led forces following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on the United States.

The charges also come amid heightening tension between the West and Iran over the Islamic republic's nuclear plans.
