SHANGHAI, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese American Michael Chang, the youngest Grand Slam champion in ATP history, is sportscasting the yearend Masters Cup in Shanghai.

The tennis genius, who was acquainted with Chinese when he was called Zhang Depei, came as sportscaster at the Shanghai Sports Channel.

Chang, 34, claimed the French Open title in 1989 when he was just 17 years and three months old and became the first American male to win the Roland Garros since Tony Trabert in 1955.

He was remembered as his thrilling five-set win for the title over Stefan Edberg and his round of 16 win over former Number one Ivan Lendl, in which he served underhanded at one point after cramping but won 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in a 4-hour, 37-minute match.

"With the schedule the way that it is now on the ATP Tour, it plays a very, very important role as for as being healthy for the top players. That's one of the things that has really been very good for you, to be able to go out, play tennis, and be healthy. How is it you find to be able to balance time to work hard, taking time to rest and relax?" Chang asked world number one Roger Federer after the opening match as an average journalist.

The year of 2002 was his swan song when Chang retired partly due to the health problems after Compiling a disappointing 7-18 match record and it was first time he's ever had a losing record and not won 10 matches in a season since he turned pro in 1987.

"Federer is obviously among the great players. He demonstrated his prowess under pressure while Nalbandian lost his confidence as early as in the second set. And he ran out of his stream in the opening set, which led to the fast collapse in the remaining sets. And I think what was in Nalbandian's mind during the third set is to have a bath as soon as possible!" Chang commented in Chinese, which was not his strong point in the past.

On Sunday, top seed Federer rallied from one set down to destroy Argentine nemesis David Nalbandian 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 in a blockbuster opening match of the 2006 circuit finale.

As for the question Chang threw to Federer, the Swiss tycoon replied:"I always used to played 25 to 30 tournaments in the past few years. Now I only play around 20 tournaments."

"I always take a lot of good care, you know, with my coach, with my condition trainer. We always sit down together and think what is the best plan.

"I always try to enter a minimum of tournaments, and I hate pulling out."

Although playing in the different era, Chang has played Federer five times in career with the Swiss wrapping off four wins.
