Jose Luis Yulo, who runs a state trading firm, has been elected the new president of the Philippine Stock Exchange, the bourse announced Tuesday.

The choice of Yulo, a non-broker and president of the Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC), would ensure that the bourse "continues to maintain and improve its high standards of efficiency and integrity," a bourse statement said.

The PITC is the government's trading arm with the socialist bloc which includes Iraq, Libya, North Korea and several other countries.

Yulo replaces Vitaliano Nanagas, who resigned after a few months on the job when some owner-brokers resisted his effort at reforms.

Yulo, who turned the PITC from near bankruptcy in 1990 to profitability in 1996, was a former president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He was educated at the University of the Philippines, Stanford Advance Management College and the Colegio de San Juan de Letran.
