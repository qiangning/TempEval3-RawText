There are a lot of loopholes in the electoral system in Zambia, an international independent review team has said, Times of Zambia reported on Thursday.

Team that was tasked by the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) to conduct a review of the last elections held on September 28 this year urged Zambian government to seal the loopholes in the next elections.

Group leader Ron Gould said here on Wednesday that both the government and ECZ would abide by the recommendations that would reflect in their report to be handed to ECZ in two weeks time.

"This is the last group we are meeting today, we have already met politicians, and government officials, police and civil society, and all the meetings are confidential to help come up with a lot of information," he said.

The team collected other reports from both local and international observers, according to Gould.

He said any country holding elections must respect the local monitors because they are always on the ground and reflect what more transparent than international monitors who only observed the counting.
