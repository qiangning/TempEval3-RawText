Denmark will fight to the last to muster maximum support for its draft resolution condemning human rights violations in China despite threats from Beijing, diplomats said here Wednesday.

The Danish delegation will present a draft resolution before the UN Human Rights Commission on Thursday and the 53 member countries will vote on the text next Tuesday.

Denmark had been expected to present its resolution on Wednesday, but diplomats said it was waiting until the last minute in the hope of winning as much support as possible.

"We are seeking to get as many co-sponsors as possible. There is no reason to present it today," one diplomat said. The deadline for proposing the resolution is 1600 GMT Thursday.

Denmark stepped in Saturday and announced it would put forward the motion critical of China after the European Union failed to agree on a joint position for the annual human rights debate.

The EU has previously sponsored a critical resolution on China each year since the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in 1989, but France this year blocked a common EU stance.

Paris was supported by Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece, drawing fire for putting trade considerations first.

While enthusiastically praising France and its allies, China warned Tuesday that any country supporting the resolution would harm its relations with the Asian giant.

"Supporting this resolution will not be beneficial to any nation's ties with China," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said.

But Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said Tuesday that Denmark would not be swayed by Chinese warnings of retaliation, nor by Beijing's sudden announcement that it would sign the UN convention on economic, social and cultural rights before the end of the year.

Petersen added that the divisions in Europe on the subject, which he said were the first in seven years with regard to China, constituted "a serious setback for the European Union's common foreign policy."

At least 11 EU members as well as the United States and several other countries have already decided to co-sponsor the draft resolution, but diplomats said the resolution had little chance of being adopted.

They said no Asian country was expected to back the text after the defection of Japan, and African and South American countries are also expected to hold back.

All previous resolutions have been defeated as a result of intense lobbying by Beijing, which presents the debate as a clash between North and South.
