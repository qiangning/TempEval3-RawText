The Polish group PKN Orlen on Friday took firm control of Lithuania's Mazeikiu Nafta after completing two transactions worth 2.344 billion dollars that give it a stake of nearly 84 percent in the Baltic oil complex, officials said.

Orlen on Thursday acquired a 53.7-percent stake in Mazeikiu -- which operates the only oil refinery in the Baltic states, an offshore terminal and pipeline -- from bankrupt Russian oil group Yukos for 1.492 billion dollars (1.133 billion euros), in the biggest block trade in the history of the Vilnius bourse.

On Friday afternoon, Lithuanian officials confirmed that the Polish oil concern had finalised another deal, this time with the Lithuanian government, giving it a further 30.66 percent in Mazeikiu for 852 million dollars.

Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas called the transaction "the deal of the century".

"There were sceptics and those who put forward conspiracy theories, but we succeeded in proving that it is possible to take important decisions for Lithuania when there is political agreement, even if there is a minority government," Kirkilas said after the sale of the government's stake was closed.

On Thursday, Yukos described the sale process as "a most extraordinary 18-month marathon" which the Kremlin repeatedly tried to derail.

Yukos had announced a tender to sell its stake in Mazeikiu last year, as a politically charged row with the Kremlin over unpaid taxes heated up.

Yukos founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, is serving an eight-year prison sentence in a Siberian camp after being convicted in May 2005 for embezzlement and other financial crimes.

The company he used to run, which was once Russia's biggest oil group, is being dismembered by the Russian courts and was declared bankrupt in March by a Moscow court.

The temporary administrator appointed by Moscow to oversee the beleaguered oil company's business asked that Yukos' attempts to sell its stake in Mazeikiu be blocked until the dispute with the Kremlin had been resolved.

But a US court lifted a restraining order barring Yukos from selling its stake in Mazeikiu Nafta, leaving the road clear for PKN Orlen to sign an agreement in May to buy Yukos' majority stake.

Since the deal between Yukos and Orlen was signed, the Lithuanian oil complex has been dogged by problems, ranging from a halt in supplies of crude by pipeline from Russia, a shutdown of its offshore oil terminal for repairs, and a fire that ripped through its key asset, the refinery, in October.
