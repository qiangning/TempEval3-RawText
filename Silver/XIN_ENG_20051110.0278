Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Naji Ottri on Thursday sent a cable of condolences to his Jordanian counterpart Adnan Badran, condemning the terrorist acts that rocked three hotels in Amman Wednesday night.

Ottri denounced this "heinous crime" that claimed life of innocent persons and targeted security and stability in that country and condemned those who stand behind such "ugly acts", the official SANA news agency reported.

"Syria expresses solidarity with the brotherly Jordan in facing the machine of blind terrorism," Ottri said, extending his sincerest condolences to the victims' families and wishing the wounded quick recovery.

Meanwhile, Speaker of Syria's People's Assembly (Parliament) Mahmoud al-Abrash sent a condolence cable to his Jordanian counterpart, condemning the bombings.

At least 57 people were killed and more than 110 others wounded in the blasts that struck the Grand Hyatt, the Radisson SAS and the Days Inn hotels in downtown Amman.

The al-Qaida terror group in Iraq claimed responsibility on Thursday for the three suicide bombings in an internet statement, but the authenticity of the statement could not be verified.
