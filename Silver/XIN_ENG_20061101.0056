Afghan and the U.S.-led coalition forces killed three suspected terrorists and arrested another in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province, a coalition press release said Wednesday.

"Three armed terrorists were killed and another detained during an early Wednesday morning operation by Afghan and coalition forces near the town of Taranli in Khost province," it said.

They were inside a compound and intelligence information led to their location and finally their elimination, it added.

No civilians were harmed during the operation. There were no casualties on Afghan and coalition forces, it further said.

Khost, a mountainous region, has been a hotbed of Taliban and other militants, who clash with foreign and government forces frequently.
