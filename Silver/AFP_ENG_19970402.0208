The Washington bureau chief of the New China News Agency, Xinhua, committed suicide over the weekend in Beijing after a collague discovered he was planning to defect, The New York Times said Wednesday.

China's state-run agency made no public mention of Wei Guoqiang's death, but it was confirmed by several of his colleagues in the Chinese capital, the daily said.

A Xinhua employee said Wei, 47, was called back to Beijing in late March, only one month after his usual yearly visit to the agency's headquarters.

"I heard he was back to discuss something with his superiors, and I was surprised because I had just read one of his articles from Washington," said Wei's colleague, who, like the others, asked not to be identified.

Another colleague said Wei was recalled after he had been discovered by a co-worker in Washington preparing documents to support a political asylum application for himself, his wife, and his 17-year- old daughter.

Once in Beijing, Wei was put under close watch at his home by a relative, but was left briefly alone over the weekend.

He chose that moment to hang himself in the bathroom of his apartment, the colleague said.
