Major shareholders in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have urged Jacques de Larosiere to accept their offer to continue as president of the bank for another four years.

Britain's Overseas Development Minister, Baroness Chalker, on Tuesday added her voice to those who are pressing de Larosiere to remain at the helm of the bank after his term of office expires in September.

"You have transformed the bank and shareholders are deeply indebted to you. When the Governors meet in Kiev next year, we very much hope that you will be there, in your second term as President," Baroness Chalker told the annual meeting of the EBRD.

De Larosiere, 67, has been asked by the EBRD's board of governors to serve a second four-year term, but says he has not made up his mind, and will give an answer in May.

Together with the outgoing vice-president, Wall Street banker Ron Freeman, de Larosiere was able to repair the damage from a scandal which, in 1993, forced the resignation of the EBRD's first president, Jacques Attali, criticized for his lavish spending.

Under the Frenchman's presidency, the bank, set up in 1991 to assist the transition to a market economy in the former Communist states of Europe, has frozen its operating costs for the past three years.

At the same time, in collaboration with Freeman, who has worked doggedly to ensure the bank's money goes only to projects which meet sound banking principles, de Larosiere has massively expanded its portfolio of loans and equity investments.

The succession of these two top posts is the main uncertainty hanging over the future of this multilateral institution, which has become an essential partner for the private sector in the former Communist states of eastern and central Europe and the ex-Soviet Union.

On Monday, the United States praised the two men, and underlined the importance of finding a good successor to Freeman, who announced last week he would step down in June to return to his old employer, Salomon Brothers.

The Assistant Secretary for International Affairs at the US Treasury, David Lipton, expressed his "appreciation for what President de Larosiere and Ron Freeman have accomplished in this institution."

Belgian finance minister Philippe Maystadt, for his part, said that Freeman's departure was "a further important argument in favour of a second term of office for Mr de Larosiere, representing stability and continuity at the head of the bank."
