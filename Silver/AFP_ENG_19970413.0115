Pope John Paul II is to honour three Turin firemen who risked their lives to save the Shroud of Turin when a weekend fire ravaged the Italian city's cathedral, a Vatican spokesman announced Sunday.

The pontiff had decided to honour the city's fire chief and two firemen on his return to Italy from Sarajevo, spokesman Joaquim Navarro said.

The fire Saturday partially destroyed the Guarini chapel which normally houses the Shroud, revered for centuries by Christians as the cloth which wrapped the body of Christ after the crucifixion.

The linen cloth had been removed from the chapel while restoration work was in progress, and temporarily placed behind the nearby central altar in the St John the Baptist cathedral.

Two firemen braved the inferno in the adjacent chapel to reach the relic, and used sledgehammers to smash a thick protective screen before carrying the priceless cloth from the cathedral, the spokesman said.

The pope, who held an open-air mass in Sarajevo's main football stadium early Sunday, was to return to Italy in the evening.
