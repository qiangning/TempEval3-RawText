Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko will meet Friday for historic face- to-face talks on board a South African ship, US envoy Bill Richardson announced here.

The meeting will take place under UN auspices in international waters on a ship that will set sail from the Gabonese capital of Libreville, he added.

"I am pleased to announce that President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila have agreed to face-to-face talks," he said.

"This is a historic occasion that hopefully will lead to a peaceful transition in Zaire. "There are no pre-conditions."

The breakthrough announcement came after Richardson met Mobutu for the second time in two days. In between, he met Kabila in the rebel-held city of Lubumbashi in southeast Zaire.

Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire while the meeting is held, he replied: "It is our hope that there will be a ceasefire while these talks take place."

Mobutu did not appear after the 90-minute meeting, although he was briefly seen at the window of his palatial residence here.

Informed Zairean sources said that Mobutu would leave Kinshasa on Thursday to head to the talks.

Kabila's rebels have captured more than half this country since they launched their offensive to topple Mobutu more than six months ago.

The ailing Mobutu, 66, who is recuperating after prostate cancer surgery, has ruled over Zaire for 32 years.

Earlier Wednesday, the president's son and spokesman Nzanga Mobutu said his father did not want to meet Kabila on board the South African vessel.

Richardson said other African leaders would also take part in the encounter. He did not say who they would be, but went out of his way to praise South African President Nelson Mandela and his Gabonese counterpart Omar Bongo.

Mandela is expected to chair the talks.

The US envoy will also be present at the start of the talks, but the agenda itself will be up to Mobutu and Kabila, he added.

France said it could "only welcome" the development if the meeting were indeed to take place.

The foreign ministry said the meeting "should coincide with a defintive halt to hostilities." The venue was immaterial: "the important thing is that the meeting should take place."
