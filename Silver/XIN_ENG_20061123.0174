Only one tenth of college students remember their parents' birthdays, while nearly half of them have never done anything to move their father and mother, according to a recent survey conducted in central China's Henan Province.

Two hundred students from four local universities were questioned on a number of issues prior to the Thanksgiving Day, an American festival which is gaining acceptance among Chinese young people.

According to the survey, only 10 percent of the students are capable of writing down their parents' birthdays, 33 percent want to celebrate their birthday with their parents, and 16 percent said they had moved their parents when they presented birthday gifts.

"When I filled out the survey, I suddenly realized how little I had done for my parents," said Yang Bo, a student from the Henan University of Industry.

Like Yang, many students found it very difficult to fill out the form, even though the questions looked simple.

Yang Jie, a girl student from the Henan University of Agriculture, said many students hold a big birthday dinner with their classmates, forgetting to thank their parents on the day. "Everyone's birthday is a day of suffering for their mother, so people should at least call their parents to express their gratitude on that special day," she said.

Most Chinese parents, however, prefer to see their children get a good exam score rather than receive a birthday call. "An excellent school report is better than anything else," said a local woman named Fu, whose son is an 18-year student.

Chinese students, mostly from one-child families, are the focus of the family and are growing up to be careless of others, said Peng Yi, a licensed psychiatrist.

Peng said that, traditionally, Chinese parents never demand anything from their children, and the children believe they deserve everything their parents have done for them.
