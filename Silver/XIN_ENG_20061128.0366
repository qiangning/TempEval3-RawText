More South Africans are voluntarily getting counseled and tested for HIV with figures rising annually, the country's health ministry said on Tuesday.

A total of 1.715 million people in South Africa, one of the world's hardest hit countries by HIV/AIDS, utilized the free pre- HIV test counseling and 80 percent of them volunteered for HIV tests between April 2005 and March 2006, the ministry spokesman Sibani Mngadi said.

"The trend is that it seems to be doubling every year," he said.

About 35 percent, or 479,086 people, of those who tested were found to be HIV positive. But Mngadi said this did not reflect prevalence within the general population.

More than 5.5 million South Africans, or 12 percent of the population, are infected with HIV. This number is the second largest in the world, only after India.

Mngadi said the government has launched a nationwide awareness campaign which encourages people to know their HIV status.

"The progress in increasing the uptake into VCT (Voluntary Counseling and Testing) is largely attributed to the campaign," he said.

In 2004-05 one million participants were counseled and 866,000 tested. In the 2003-2004 period 690,000 people were counseled and 511,000 tested.

The uptake was also enhanced by the wide accessibility of VCT service across the country, Mngadi said. A total of 4,172 VCT service points are operational in both medical and non-medical sites in all nine provinces, and VCT is available in more than 90 percent of clinics.

A draft program for the World AIDS Day event on Dec. 1, issued by the health ministry on Tuesday, suggested that the South African government would launch a new HIV/AIDS-combating strategy in 2007-2011.

Local media revealed earlier this month that the strategy aims to halve the HIV-infection rate and provide treatment to 750,000 patients within the next five years.
