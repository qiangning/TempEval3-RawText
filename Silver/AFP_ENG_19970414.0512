A Turkish state security court Monday ordered the release of 13 leaders of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party (Hadep) who have been in jail since last June, a party official said.

"Party leader Murat Bozlak and 12 other party administrators were released at the end of today's hearing," Hadep official and former MP Sirri Sakik told AFP.

"This is a delayed but positive step towards internal peace and we are happy about this," Sakik said.

Bozlak and the other party leaders were arrested at the end of a party congress here on June 23 last year, which became the scene of the desecration of the Turkish flag by a Kurdish youth.

The trial of the Kurdish youth, who is still under arrest, and the released Hadep leaders will continue in May, Sakik said.

"But the release of the party officials might be an indication that they will be acquitted," he added.

Television footage showing the huge Turkish flag being thrown onto the floor by the masked youth at last year's Hadep congress caused public outrage.

The Ankara state security prosecutor has demanded capital punishment for the youth, Faysal Akcan, who has confessed to the incident.

The prosecutor has also sought 22-year prison sentences for Bozlak and 23 other Hadep officials on charges of "setting up an armed gang."

Bozlak said at the previous hearing last Friday that he and the other party leaders were not responsible for the flag's desecration, adding Hadep "denounces such actions."

"It is now becoming clear that accusations against the Hadep officials are baseless," Sakik said.

Hadep failed to enter parliament in Turkey's general elections in December 1995 as it received about 4.5 percent of the national vote, well short of the required 10 percent threshold.

During the election campaign, Hadep had said it supported the rights of the Kurds, but that it was not a separatist group.

The party grew out of the defunct pro-Kurdish Democracy Party, which was banned three years ago on the grounds of cooperation with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

The PKK has been waging a separatist war in southeastern Turkey since 1984 and more than 23,000 people have been killed in violence in the region since then.

Four former Democracy Party deputies were sentenced in 1995 to 15 years in prison for collaboration with the PKK. They include Leyla Zana, who was named winner in 1995 of the Sakharov prize for freedom of expression by the European Parliament.
