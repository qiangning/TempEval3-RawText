Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who is to receive an honorary Oscar in February, on Thursday said the award was "a nice surprise" which made him happy.

Morricone is the man behind the memorable music used in 1960s spaghetti westerns such as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and classic movies such as "Cinema Paradiso" and has composed more than 300 scores in a career spanning 45 years.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said on Wednesday he will be presented with the award at the 2007 Oscars in Hollywood on February 25.

"I am stunned but happy because the Oscar is coming my way while I am still fully active in my profession," the 78-year old said.

"In my life, I've never sought the centre stage. I have never asked a director to be allowed to work with him and I've never asked anybody to promote me, especially not in America. The Oscar is a nice surprise. I had stopped thinking about it," said Morricone, who is to conduct a Christmas concert in Milan on Saturday.

Morricone made a name for himself by composing the music for Sergio Leone's spaghetti western "For a Fistful of Dollars". He went on to write the scores of classics such as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,", "Once upon a Time in America" and "Cinema Paradiso".
