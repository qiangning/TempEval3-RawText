Japan's Finance Ministry ordered the troubled Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co. Friday to suspend most of its operations, marking the first insolvency of a Japanese life insurer since World War II.

Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said the order followed a report from the company outlining difficulties in restructuring its business following huge losses suffered during the "bubble" economy of the late 1980s.

With accumulated losses of about 200 billion yen (1.6 billion dollars), the company itself decided on the action at a board meeting Friday morning.

"Our action to order the suspension followed its decision, and the decision was made at its own discretion," the finance minister said.

Mitsuzuka said the ministry would take step "to protect policy holders" and was preparing measures to assume control of the company's assets.

Among the measures, the ministry is arranging to transfer contracts to other insurance companies to prevent a credit crisis.

"The order of suspension is to ensure the credibility of the industry and to dispel policy-holder concerns," Mitsuzuka told a news conference.

Asked about the possibility of similar cases, Mitsuzuka said: "We expect this case to be the first and last in the insurance industry."

Nissan Mutual president Hiroshi Yonemoto said the net loss in the 12 months to last March was estimated at 52.5 billion yen, the company's first net loss ever. He added that unrealised losses totalled about 100 billion yen on securities holdings and a further 43.6 billion yen on properties and loans.

"We had thought we could handle the situation through restructuring efforts, but the situation did not allow us to," Yonemoto said.

Nissan Mutual is Japan's 19th-largest life insurer with 5,000 employees and close ties with Nissan Motor Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd.

Yonemoto said he would seek continued support from Nissan after transferring existing contracts to other life insurers.

"We have explored a variety of options including a merger but under current legislation, this was the only option we could choose," he said.

In a statement, Mitsuzuka said the suspension followed difficulties stemming from the sale of high-yielding pension policies and a subsequent downturn in share prices, causing a deterioration in returns.

To protect policy-holders, Mitsuzuka appointed the Japan Life Insurance Association to control and manage its assets and liabilities.

The suspension of business covers the handling of policy cancellations, entering into new contracts and lending to policy- holders. But Mitsuzuka said the company would be allowed to keep making payments to policy-holders and continue other operations to ensure payouts are met when they fall due.

Mitsuzuka also said he would ask associated industries and a policy holders' protection fund set up by the insurance sector last year to help clean up the mess. The protection fund is supposed to disburse up to 200 billion yen in assistance to the life insurance industry.

"There is unlikely to be a similar case to Nissan Mutual Life," Mitsuzuka said, noting that other Japanese life insurance companies have been able to restructure their business activities despite difficult conditions.

Makoto Fukuda, head of the finance ministry's insurance department, said Nissan Mutual Life's accumuluated losses were about 200 billion yen, exacerbated by recent declines in share prices. As a result, he said, unrealised gains on securities holdings at the end of March were zero.

Speaking a separate news conference, Fukuda said heavy selling of high-yielding pension funds caused an "abnormal situation" in the company's financial condition. "This product has no problem but it is a problem with the way it was sold by the company," he said.

Fukuda also said that the company's mutual ownership probably prevented it from boosting equity to deal with its difficulties.

While the life insurance association has the authority to work out the bail-out scheme, he said Hitachi and Nissan Motor might participate.

"We cannot say that the Hitachi-Nissan group is entirely irrelevant, as they have been sending managers to Nissan Life," Fukuda said.

Fukuda said his ministry had "no immediate plan to inject public funds to bail out Nissan Life" but added that it planned to protect employees and launch an investigation into the present financial condition of Nissan Life.
