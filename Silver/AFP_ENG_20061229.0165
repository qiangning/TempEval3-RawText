Belarus dispatched a senior energy official Friday to Moscow to join talks on defusing a row over Russian natural gas imports that threatened to disrupt energy supplies to the European Union from Monday.

"An additional delegation is flying to Moscow, headed by Eduard Tovpenets, first deputy energy minister," Andrei Zhukov, an aide to Belarus' energy minister, told AFP in Minsk. "We are flying to reach final agreement. I think the issue will be resolved."

Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom is threatening to switch off natural gas supplies to Belarus at 10:00 am (0700 GMT) Monday, New Year's day, if the ex-Soviet republic fails to agree to a more than doubling of price.

Belarus, which lies between Russia and the European Union, threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of Russian gas to Europe, potentially hitting supplies in Germany, Lithuania and Poland.

Belarus says that without a contract for its own supplies, there can be no contract on transit.

Gazprom vice-president Alexander Medvedev told France's Le Figaro daily on Friday that this amounted to "grotesque blackmail" and warned that European clients could face shortfalls.

Although daily talks have so far ended without compromise, both sides on Friday expressed cautious optimism as Gazprom executives in Moscow met with Dmitry Kazakov, the head of Belarus' gas pipeline company Beltstransgaz.

The situation is "tense, but there is still a chance, of course," Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said.

If no deal is struck, the stage will be set for a New Year's crisis similar to a cut-off of Russian gas 12 months ago to Ukraine during a similar pricing dispute, with knock-on effects through western Europe.

Gazprom insists that its price increases -- already imposed on Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova -- are part of a legitimate move to end Soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates.

However the Kremlin-connected gas giant's rough tactics against Russia's smaller neighbours has damaged Moscow's image abroad and caused alarm in Europe about what the European Union sees as overreliance on Russian energy supplies.

The EU Commission says it is following the situation "very closely" and has called for a rapid settlement.

Belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of Russian gas flowing to Europe, amounting to about five percent of Europe's total gas needs. The other 80 percent of westward Russian exports are piped via Ukraine.

Ukraine announced on Thursday its readiness to increase the transit of Russian gas through its territory in case of possible disruptions on the Belarus route.

"We could increase transit with the volume needed to ensure stable functioning of the economies of our European neighbours," Ukraine's Energy Minister Yury Boyko said.

Currently, Belarus pays Gazprom 46.68 dollars per 1,000 cubic metres of gas.

Gazprom originally demanded an increase to 200 dollars, which is closer to western European prices, unless Belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator Beltransgaz.

Gazprom has since reduced that demand to 105 dollars per 1,000 cubic metres -- 75 dollars per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments, plus the equivalent of another 30 dollars in shares of Beltransgaz.
