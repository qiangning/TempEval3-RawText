From Sao Paulo to London to New Delhi, governments worldwide have spoken out against the execution of Saddam Hussein, with the Vatican too lending a voice of moral authority to the anti-capital punishment camp.

"We don't think a crime should be avenged by another crime," Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino, who heads the Vatican's Justice and Peace department, said this week.

Even Britain, whose Prime Minister Tony Blair has been a staunch US ally since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, reiterated its opposition to capital punishment while saying the decision to execute Saddam rested with Baghdad.

"We are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle but the decision is one for the Iraqi authorities" a foreign office spokesman told AFP.

That position was much in line with Washington's own, however.

Asked whether the US government had a hand in deciding when Saddam was to be hanged, a White House spokesman said last week that that "was a matter for the Iraqi people, and we are observers to that process. They are a sovereign government."

Braving the US stand of non-interference, defence lawyers for the convicted former Iraqi chief made a last-ditch bid on Friday and asked a US judge to stop the US military from handing over Saddam to Iraqi authorities for execution.

Hours before Saddam was taken to the gallows, the US Justice Department said the attorneys had filed a request for an immediate "temporary stay of execution", arguing that as a prisoner of war, he deserved protection under the Geneva Conventions.

A US federal judge rejected the request, CBS news reported.

Italy meanwhile, echoing strong opposition to the execution in European Union countries, issued yet another plea for generosity.

"No fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another," said Prime Minister Romano Prodi.

"This is a principle that unites all civilisations and all religions. And it is the only principle that can allow the building of solid and lasting peace," he said.

"I issue a final and sad plea for wisdom and magnanimity to prevail", he said, according the ANSA news agency.

Brazil and Chile, both opposed to the US-led war in Iraq, agreed.

Santiago argued against carrying out the hanging after the sentence was confirmed. "The application of the death penalty in such a swift manner is contrary to our principles," a junior minister said Friday.

Brazil added in an official statement that it "does not believe the execution of the sentence contributes to the pacification of Iraq."

In the United States, two major newspapers also wondered what impact the execution of Saddam would have on Iraq and the world.

The New York Times took a critical tone, warning that hanging the deposed Iraqi leader would not solve Iraq's ills. "Toppling Saddam Hussein did not automatically create a new and better Iraq. Executing him won't either."

The Washington Post was more circumspect, saying that the execution came on the heels of an "imperfect" trial for Saddam.

"For those who oppose the death penalty, as we do, any execution is regrettable -- and this one, should it come to pass, will follow highly imperfect judicial proceedings and may, in the short term, inflame sectarian divisions," the daily said.

Not unexpectedly, Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi was far harsher, calling Saddam's execution illegal and he was still a prisoner of war.

"The court which tried him is illegal. Iraq is an occupied country. It is the American and British forces (in Iraq) that judged him and, in this case, decided to execute him, and they bear the responsibility," Kadhafi said Friday.

Although the condemned man himself has said he would go to the gallows as a potential "martyr", India, which enjoyed close ties with Iraq, too appealed for leniency for Saddam this week.

"India hopes the death sentence against... Saddam Hussein will not be carried out," a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying.

In a letter penned in his cell and released Wednesday, the 69-year-old former leader convicted for crimes against humanity wrote: "I sacrifice myself. If God wills it, he will place me among the true men and martyrs.
