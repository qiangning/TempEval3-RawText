Vietnamese police have uncovered a trans-national drug trafficking ring alleged to have trafficked 1, 000 heroin cakes, each weighing 0.35 kilograms, into the country from neighboring Cambodia since 2002, Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.

Heroin was brought into Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City via southern Kien Giang province's Ha Tien town, which borders Cambodia, before heading to Quang Ninh province and other northern localities, the report quoted the police as saying.

Late last month, local police arrested Kong Hung, a Cambodian, in Ha Tien town, with five heroin cakes. The man, who was a member of the ring, admitted that he has so far this year transported 194 heroin cakes across the border.
