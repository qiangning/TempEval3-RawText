The Cambodian Football Federation has re-elected a close ally of Prime Minister Hun Sen as its president, despite claims of political interference in choosing the sport's national chief.

Newly-elected Sao Sokha, a military police chief, on Sunday vowed to work to improve the quality of the country's football team after he was chosen unanimously on Saturday by the 11-member executive committee.

He was first brought in as the new president of the Cambodian Football Federation in an April election, but the world football governing body FIFA claimed political interference marred those elections.

FIFA also threatened to suspend its 250,000 dollars in annual funding to Cambodia's national football program, which has struggled to gain international respect after numerous scandals and a dismal record of losses.

"We have nothing now, but we have to boost and encourage our players, to have more players and more supporters," Sao Sokha told AFP.

"When there are more players, more supporters and more matches, we will have more experience and we can choose the best quality players for our nation and for international competitions," he added.

He said that Rene Z. Adad, representative for the Asian Football Confederation, had observed Saturday's election, and labelled them "democratic and good".

Cambodia is currently ranked 184 out of 205 countries by FIFA.
