Japanese women's sensation Ai Miyazato missed the cut in the Asia-Japan-Okinawa Open on Friday in a disappointing end to her debut tournament against the men.

Miyazato, whose brother shared the halfway lead in the 830,000-dollar Asian and Japanese-sanctioned event, slumped to a second-round 78 to be 16 over for two rounds.

Defending champion Kiyoshi Miyazato fired a 67 at the par-71 Naha Golf Club for a share of the lead along with countrymen Yasuharu Imano and Kaname Yokoo on seven-under-par 135.

Ai Miyazato, the first Japanese woman to play in a men's tournament, got off to a disastrous start with a triple bogey at the par-four first.

The 20-year-old World Cup-winner had a rollercoaster run with birdies on the second, bogey on the third and birdie again on the fourth.

But she double-bogeyed the par-three eighth hole and dropped another shot on nine. She birdied 10 and 15 but bogeyed four of the last five in a demoralising finish.

Meanwhile Kiyoshi Miyazato fired five birdies against a lone bogey to tie with Imano and Yokoo, who shot a 64 and 70 respectively.

Miyazato had birdies on the par-four third and par-three fifth, dropping a shot on seven but enjoyed a blemish-free back nine with birdies on 11, 12 and 15.

"I was fully focused and gave it my best as I was desperate to score well today which I did," he said. "I had a good day as I was able to gauge the wind and struck the ball consistently well.

Imano, who finished second in the recent Japan Golf Tour Money list with two victories in 2005, was blemish-free as he nailed seven birdies on the card to charge into contention.

Newly crowned Asian Tour Order of Merit winner Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand fired a fine 67 for a 136 total and shared fourth place with local hope Ryuichi Oda and Australias Chris Campbell.

The Okinawa Open is the opening leg for the 2006 season for the Asian Tour and Japan Golf Tour.
