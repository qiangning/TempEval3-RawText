South Africa has the largest leasing industry in the continent with 4.6 billion dollars in 2005, which is about 73 percent of the African leasing volume.

East Africa accounts for only 100 million dollars in 2005.

A lease is a usage agreement between the equipment owner ( lessor) and user of the equipment (lessee).

Uganda's Dfcu Bank's business development manager David Mulinde was quoted by local media on Tuesday as saying that the lease industry is characterized by high concentration of equipment in the transport, construction and manufacturing sectors.

He said the region's average lease transactions are between 10, 000 dollars and 250,000 dollars.
