Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita said Monday that the country's economic recovery was gathering pace and described the dollar's recent surge against the yen as "steep."

Speaking at a lecture in Tokyo, the central bank governor said the recovery was "becoming firmer" with the increase in consumption taxes from three percent to five percent on April 1 unlikely to thwart the upturn.

Matsushita also said that drastic restructuring measures announced by the troubled Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. earlier this month showed that Japanese banks were being "aggressive" in resolving their debt problems.
