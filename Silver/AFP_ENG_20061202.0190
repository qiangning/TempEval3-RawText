Japanese wondergirl skater Mao Asada is heading to Russia to defend the Grand Prix Final after winning the NHK Trophy Friday with the highest ever score for a woman.

Japanese rivals Fumie Suguri and Yukari Nakano, who won the NHK event last year, delighted the home fans by finishing second and third respectively.

Asada, 16, collected 199.52 points in the Japanese competition, having marked 130.02 points in the free skating section and 69.50 from the short program.

The overall point score edged above 198.06 points won by two-time world champion Irina Slutskaya of Russia at the 2005 Cup of Russia.

"I was so happy because this is my first victory this season," Asada said. "About the total score...it was a surprise and I was happy to see that."

Asada gained her international prominence by beating Slutskaya to win the Grand Prix Final last year.

Asada, the crowd's all-out favorite, kicked off her free skating program with a wobbly landing from a triple axel, but her performance improved after that.

"I thought I could ride the wave if I could succeed the triple axel. Today, I landed but kind of wobbled a bit. But it was not a failure and I was on my wave," she said.

"The rest of the programs had jumps that I felt confident about. I was able to do as I wanted, and I was relieved by that," she said.

There was considerable pressure on the high school student, who needed to win the competition to advance to the Grand Prix Final in Saint Petersburg later this month. The NHK Trophy is the last in the six-round qualifying series for the Final.

"This was the first time that I was put in a high-pressure situation like this. I was nervous but I came out OK. Maybe I grew up a little," said Asada, a driving force behind Japan's figure skating craze.

"I want to keep this momentum going into the finals. I hope I can do (a triple axel) there," Asada said.

Second-placed Suguri, 25, the world silver medallist who also came in second at Skate Canada this season, said she had struggled with fitness for the home competition.

"New generations of skaters are growing, even girls who are 10 years younger than I. I must to work more in order to survive," said Suguri, who won a total 179.31 points, scoring 117.39 in free skating and 61.92 from her short program.

"Maybe I failed to build my stamina, and it might have shown at the end," she said. "I want to learn from new ideas from new girls."

Nakano, who failed to defend her title, said she was disappointed about repeated mistakes, particularly in her free skating, but that she would work to sharpen the accuracy of her jumps and spins.
