China hopes US President George W. Bush's imminent visit to the country will advance Sino-US relations in an all-round day, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Thursday

"We expect that Bush's visit, slated for Nov. 19 to 21, will increase consensus, step up mutual trust, expand exchange and cooperation, and promote Sino-US constructive and cooperative relations in 21st century in an all-round way," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told the regular briefing Thursday afternoon.

When asked to comment on President Bush's remarks in Kyoto Tuesday,which touched upon Sino-US relations, human rights and religion, Liu said that China pursues a path of peaceful development.

Noting that China has made remarkable, important progress in the field of human rights, Liu said the Chinese people, in accordance with laws, enjoy all various kinds of democracy and freedom, including the freedom in religious belief.

"All countries should hold exchanges and dialogues on human rights on the principled basis of equality, mutual respect and non-intervention in internal affairs," the spokesman said.
