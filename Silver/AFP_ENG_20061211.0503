The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, on Monday called on Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy to take steps to bar hundreds of potential troublemakers from attending this week's UEFA Cup tie between Paris Saint Germain and Panathinaikos.

Delanoe was speaking amid fears of a repeat of ugly scenes that followed PSG's 4-2 UEFA Cup loss to Israeli side Hapoel Tel Aviv on November 23.

A black off-duty police officer shot dead a PSG supporter and seriously injured another as he tried to shield a Hapoel Tel Aviv fan from a mob of around 150 PSG supporters.

Delanoe said that PSG "should lead by example in the fight against violence, racism and anti-semitism" but that it was "100 percent the responsibility of the Interior Ministry" to deal with the problem, and they could start by preventing potential troublemakers from attending Wednesday night's game.

Panathinaikos have also had their problems on and off the pitch with Greek police detaining 62 of their fans, some of whom were found in possession of weapons and cannabis, after clashing with rivals Olympiakos last month.
