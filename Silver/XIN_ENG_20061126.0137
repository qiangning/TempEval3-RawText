Cyprus' Foreign Minister George Lillikas left for Finland on Sunday for negotiations on Turkey's EU entry bid but said he was not optimistic about the outcome concerning Cyprus issue.

"We are going with readiness, good will and positive spirit," Lillikas told Cyprus News Agency (CNA) at Larnaca airport, adding that the information they got from different sources didn't show any optimism.

Turkey, aspiring to become an EU member, refuses to implement the EU-Turkey Customs Union Protocol by opening its ports and airports to Cypriot vessels and aircraft.

As the holder of the EU rotating presidency, Finland is launching a last-ditch initiative to avert a possible EU-Turkey crisis regarding its EU course.

Finland's Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja has invited his Turkish and Cypriot counterparts to the Finnish city of Tampere, to work out a possible solution at the sideline of the Euro- Mediterranean Conference.

Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily intervened and occupied the north of Cyprus following a coup by a group of Greek officers.

In 2004, the internationally-recognized Republic of Cyprus entered the EU in the name of the whole island and now has EU veto powers over its rival Turkey.
