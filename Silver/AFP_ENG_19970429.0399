Zlatko Aleksovski, extradited to The Hague to stand trial at the international warcrimes tribunal here, said Tuesday he would plead not guilty to the charges against him.

Aleksovski, a former officer in the Bosnian Croat militia (HVO), is charged with involvement in the massacre of dozens of Moslems in the central Bosnian village of Ahmici during Moslem-Croat fighting in 1993.

"I am innocent of everything" I have been accused of, he said at a public hearing.

He said he had read the charge list over night after being transfered to The Hague by Croatia on Monday.
