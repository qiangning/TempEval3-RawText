Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is being treated at the National Heart Institute (NHI), said Saturday he plans to take a complete rest for several weeks.

Mahathir said that out of health considerations, he will stay away from the UMNO General Assembly slated for next week, though he accepted invitation and had originally planned to attend the meeting.

UMNO, formally known as the United Malays National Organization, is the largest political party in Malaysia. UMNO President takes over as prime minister in the government.

"I want to rest...not making any statement...hope the (UMNO) assembly runs smoothly," Mahathir said in an interview with the Bernama news agency and Radio Television Malaysia (RTM).

The former prime minister, who was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and long pants, appeared in high spirit during the 20-minute interview.

Mahathir said it was fortunate that he had sought immediate treatment as soon as he had the mild heart attack, and this had enabled doctors to dilute the blood clot in his coronary artery.

Mahathir, who will turn 81 next month, was rushed to the NHI early Thursday morning after complaining of chest pains. Friday night, he was transferred from the Coronary Care Unit to a normal ward.

Before this, the former leader had a very busy schedule abroad, which brought him to several countries.

Mahathir had a coronary artery bypass surgery in 1989, and in 1999 he underwent full treatment for a lung infection.
