Observers from 14 countries and the United Nations will watch the upcoming general elections in Bolivia, Foreign Minister Armando Loaiza said Wednesday in a statement.

Some 140 observers from "friendly nations," including members of the Organization of American States (OAS) and from the United Nations (UN) would watch the Dec. 18 elections at Bolivia's polling stations, said the statement.

The OAS mission, headed by Horacio Serpa, Colombia's former presidential candidate, has already arrived in La Pas, the administrative capital of Bolivia, it said.

The voters are also expected to elect regional governors and decide if there should be a citizens' assembly to decide on a new political reform package in the poorest country in South America.

The elections are a result of a parliament decision made in July following growing civil unrest and political opposition which caused the resignation of then-President Carlos Mesa and the temporary appointment of Eduardo Rodriguez in June.
