A Greek aircraft bound for New York made a dawn emergency landing Sunday in Ireland after a telephone caller said there was a bomb on board "for Saddam (Hussein)", the dead Iraqi dictator.

The plane, belonging to Olympic Airlines, had left Athens for the United States with 183 passengers and 12 crew and landed at Shannon in the west of Ireland.

Those aboard disembarked and were taken to a hotel while the aircraft, an Airbus 340, was searched.

"Unknown individuals speaking English with an Arab accent warned of the presence of a bomb on the plane, saying it was 'for Saddam'", an airline spokesman said, adding two calls had been received at Athens airport early Suday morning.

The airline told the aircraft to land at the nearest airport and it touched down at Shannon at 4:20 am (0420GMT).
