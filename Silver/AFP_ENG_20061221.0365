The US economy grew at a 2.0 percent rate in the third quarter, the government reported Thursday in a slight downward revision of gross domestic product.

The Commerce Department, in its final revision of growth in the July-September quarter, notched down its earlier estimate of a 2.2 percent annualized pace.

Wall Street analysts had on average expected no revision from the 2.2 percent figure.

In any case, the growth was the slowest since the final quarter in 2005 and a deceleration from the 2.6 percent pace in the second quarter.

The revision came from a slight downward adjustment in the estimate of consumer spending growth in the quarter to 2.8 percent instead of 2.9 percent.

The department said the slowdown in consumer spending was driven by better data on medical care spending, which was revised lower, and by a steeper slump in real estate spending.

That offset slight upward revisions to durable goods spending.

The latest revision left unchanged the picture of an economy that has shifted to a slower growth pace, held back by slumping real estate but still underpinned by consumer and business spending.

Spending on residential property plunged 18.7 percent, revised from an earlier estimate of an 18 percent drop, the steepest drop since 1991.

"The downward revision in the third-quarter GDP data was almost entirely due to the recession in housing," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight. "The spillover effects to other parts of the economy continue to be limited."

Business investment grew 10 percent, unrevised from the last estimate.

An inflation index linked to GDP showed a 2.4 percent increase in prices, and was unrevised after a four percent jump in the second quarter.

Core prices excluding food and energy were up 2.2 percent, slightly ahead of the Federal Reserve's unofficial target but suggesting that the central bank's view of easing inflationary pressures is correct.

The Fed, which halted a string of rate increases in August, has indicated it may lift interest rates further if inflation kicks back up, but most economists see the next move as a rate cut to help stimulate flagging growth.

Robert Brusca at FAO Economics said the GDP report also lowered the estimate for US productivity.

"GDP is old news, but what stings in this report is the marginal lowering of already weak productivity growth that will result from weaker GDP," he said.

"Weak productivity growth is bad news, and even weaker growth is worse news -- even if it is a marginal revision. This revision does not obviate or reduce but rather worsen this new trend."
