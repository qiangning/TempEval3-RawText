Iraq's first Kurdish head of state Jalal Talabani said Tuesday that he would not seek a second presidential mandate if the post remained largely ceremonial following this week's watershed general election.

"In keeping with the new constitution, the president of the republic does not have the power to participate in the management of state and therefore I would not agree to become an honorary president," said Talabani.

"I refuse to present my candidacy in such circumstances," he added in a statement released overnight.

Iraq goes to the polls on Thursday to elect its first full-term parliament since the 2003 US-led invasion and the fall of Saddam Hussein.

"The president of the republic must be a real president, active in the leadership of the state, for the simple reason that Iraqis expect a lot from him," said Talabani.

"They address numerous demands to him, they call on him to end injustice and to help them solve their problems. If the president is honorary, he cannot respond to these demands."

The 72-year-old Talabani leads the main Kurdish coalition contesting Thursday's election, an alliance of his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Massud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party.

The first task of the elected 275 members of parliaments will be to appoint, by a two-thirds majority, a president and two vice-presidents.

The presidency council will then have 15 days to name a prime minister, who will form a cabinet to be put to parliament for approval.

The constitution, adopted at a referendum in October, limits the powers of the four-year head of state in order to guard against any return to the decades of authoritarian dictatorship during the Saddam Hussein era.

A strong man who hates to be made a fool of, Talabani publicly reprimanded Shiite Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari, accusing him of violating Iraqi law and exceeding his authority by taking decisions without consulting the president.
