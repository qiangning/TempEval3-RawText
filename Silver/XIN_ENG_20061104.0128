A performing gala themed on "Ode to Friendship" was staged here Saturday evening to mark the Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and facilitate cultural exchanges.

In one hour and a half, performers serve up a real feast to both eyes and ears for state and government leaders and high- ranking officials from more than 40 African countries, who are here for the two-day landmark gathering.

From traditional Peking opera, upbeat tropical dance and drum to acrobatics, African and Chinese artists demonstrated their exquisite skills and profound culture.

The summit, themed on "friendship, peace, cooperation and development", is regarded as the largest diplomatic event ever held between China and Africa.
