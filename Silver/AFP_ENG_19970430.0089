Negotiations were moving forward between police and a handful of armed separatists near this remote west Texas community, authorities said.

"Things are looking very positive," said on Tuesday Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. "We are optimistic that there is going to be a peaceful outcome."

The separatists in the negotiation are demanding that they be treated as diplomats, CNN television reported.

Police believe that at least 13 people are holed up in a small house they call their "embassy" on the property of Richard McLaren, the self-proclaimed leader of the "Republic of Texas."

The group, which includes one woman but no children, claims the United States illegally annexed the state in 1845.

"We do know they have weapons," Cox said.

At least 75 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety, the US Border Patrol, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a special assault unit have surrounded McLaren's property at the Davis Mountain resort near Fort Davis.

Since the standoff began three days ago, authorities have declined to say exactly how many officers are here. But a grocery store owner at Fort Davis said he has sold enough food to feed some 300 men.

The forces are deployed some 1.5 kilometers (one mile) from the "embassy." The police command post is some seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, not far from a firehouse occupied by the separatists on Sunday and seized by police Monday.

Tensions rose on Monday when Texas Attorney General Dan Morales announced that three members of the group had been charged with "organized criminal activity," and that three others face kidnapping charges.

McLaren and several other Republic of Texas members were wanted on state and federal contempt of court charges.

On Sunday, a separatist "commando" held a husband and wife hostage for some 12 hours in a bid to free Robert Scheidt, one of their comrades jailed on weapons charges.

The couple, Joe and Margaret Rowe, was exchanged Monday for Scheidt. Joe Rowe was treated for minor injuries.

Shortly after mid-day Tuesday, McLaren placed a package outside the residence containing "legal documents" for his attorney, Terence O'Rourke. O'Rourke, who was barred from entering the residence by police, said he has talked to McLaren by telephone.

"He's willing to die for what he believes in," O'Rourke said of his client. But he said: "He doesn't need to be a martyr."

Authorities spent hours retrieving the documents with the help of an armored vehicle because the area around the "embassy" was reportedly studded with explosives.

"It wasn't a major planned operation," Cox said. "We've got some felony warrants to serve and we're going to serve them."

Around 120 residents of nearby properties have been asked by police to leave their homes. Those who sought to return Tuesday were barred by a police roadblock across the only street into the community.

"It's for their personal safety," Cox said.

The Red Cross has set up a shelter for residents in a gym at Fort Davis, and members of the Texas National Guard have set up tents to shield law enforcement officials and their equipment -- which now includes two armored vehicles -- from the blinding Texas sun.
