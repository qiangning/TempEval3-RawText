A suicide bomber killed 13 Iraqis queuing at a police recruitment centre in central Baghdad on Thursday and wounded 12 more, security and medicals sources said.

The bomber, believed to have been wearing an explosive vest, struck at sunrise outside a police academy in a street in the heart of the Iraqi capital that has been barred to traffic, he said.

Before the traffic ban had been put into place, the police academy near Palestine Street in the Rusafa District, had come under attacks three times by car bomb, mortar and a suicide bomber.

Ten police recruits were killed instantly and another three died of their injuries after being taken to the al-Kindi hospital, a medical source said.

In October last year, a bomber in a suicide vest killed 17 people when he blew himself up on a bus dropping police cadets off at the academy.

Since then security has been improved in the area, which is near the main interior ministry headquarters, but the city of Baghdad remains in the grip of mounting insurgent and sectarian violence.
