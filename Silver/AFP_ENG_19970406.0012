Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan and Ford Motor Co. of the United States plan to unify their parts procurement systems in order to reduce production costs, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Sunday.

The move follows the two companies' earlier accord to share basic designs of motor vehicles, the leading economic daily said. The move may be implemented by 2002, the report said.

The automakers' business links have grown since Ford took effective control of Mazda by raising its equity stake from 24.4 percent to 33.4 percent in May last year.

Under Japanese law, if Ford were to increase its stake in Mazda beyond this level it would have been obliged to launch a full takeover bid.

The two companies will select parts suppliers on the basis of international competitiveness, with no preferential treatment given to traditional parts makers in Mazda's "keiretsu" corporate group, the daily said.

Supplier candidates among Japanese firms include car electronic parts maker Denso Corp. and oil seal producer NOK Corp., it said. Both suppliers have capital ties with Japan's auto giant Toyota Motor Corp.
