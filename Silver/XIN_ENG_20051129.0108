China has asked Malaysia to conduct immediate investigation into and punish offenders involved in the assault and humiliation of Chinese citizens in Malaysia, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said here Tuesday.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Embassy in Malaysia have expressed grave concern about reports of Chinese citizens being assaulted and humiliated in Malaysia, and made strong representations to the Malaysian government, demanding immediate investigation into and stern punishment of the offenders, said spokesman Liu Jianchao.

Among the cases, a woman, believed to be a Chinese national, was forced to do squats in front of a woman in police uniform in a room with some lookers. The scene was videotaped and shown to Malaysian ministers and parliament members as evidence, Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported on Friday.

Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had reportedly asked the police authorities not to "hide" any facts in the probe into the videofootage. Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak also said that Malaysia would carry out a thorough investigation into the video evidence and would not protect the perpetrators, according to Bernama.

"The Chinese government has always considered it important to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens from being violated," Liu said at a routine press conference.

The Chinese side has noticed the promise of senior Malaysian officials to investigate the cases earnestly, Liu said.

He stressed "China will continue to urge Malaysia to investigate and deal with these cases in a serious and just manner and bring the trouble makers to justice so as to really protect the dignity and safety of Chinese citizens and prevent such cases from recurring."

In response to a question on Malaysian Minister of Interior Azmi Khalid's possible visit to China, Liu said the two countries have been discussing details for the "important visit" on an date that is proper for both sides.

China welcomes Khalid to come for a visit, which will play a positive role in pushing forward bilateral cooperation in certain fields, the spokesman said.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced last Thursday that Premier Wen Jiabao will pay an official visit to Malaysia in mid-December.
