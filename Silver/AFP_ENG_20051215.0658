China's Yao Ming is the leading Western Conference vote-getter with 729,178 votes after the first returns of the 2006 NBA all-star balloting programme, announced Thursday.

Tracy McGrady leads forwards in voting from fans around the world who are responsible for picking the starters for the 55th NBA All-Star Game, which will be played in Houston on February 19.

The Rockets (8-12) are in last place in the Southwest Division due in part to a back injury that has forced McGrady to miss eight games.

Yao is a three-time All-Star averaging a career-high 19.5 points and 9.10 rebounds and McGrady is averaging 24.0 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists.

A five-time All-Star, McGrady has garnered 600,507 votes and is followed by Minnesota's Kevin Garnett with 469,497.

Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is the top vote-getter among Western Conference guards with 664,744 with reigning league Most Valuable Player Steve Nash second with 562,846.

Cleveland forward LeBron James is the leader among Eastern Conference players with 665,849 votes, 19,764 more than Miami Heat center Shaquille O'Neal.
