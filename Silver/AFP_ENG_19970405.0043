Hanoi has set up a commission to oversee the construction of Vietnam's second main road artery linking the north to the south of the country, a report said Saturday.

The first of the Southeast Asian country's major infrastructure projects will be completed through a mass moblisation of Vietnamese workers.

The 12-member road commission is headed by Prime Minsiter Vo Van Kiet and which includes several ministers.

"This is a major project which will use the labour of milllions of people," Kiet was Saturday quoted as saying by the daily Vietnam News.

The "Truong Son" highway will be built parallel to the existing main road which runs along the country's coast and is exposed to floods and typhoons.

The new 1,800-kilometer (1,125-mile) road will follow some of the route of the famous Ho Chi Minh trail which was the major supply route of the communist forces fighting the Americans during the Vietnam war.

It will link the capital Hanoi with the southern hub of Ho Chi Minh City and will initially have two lanes which will later be expanded to four and then to six in some places after 2002.

The feasability study for the project is expected to begin in June and work should start next year. The total cost of the project will could come to as much as 5.5 billion dollars.
