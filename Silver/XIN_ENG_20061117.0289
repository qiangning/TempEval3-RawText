Zambian government Friday warned of stern action against farmers or organizations found guilty of abusing the fertilizer support program.

Agriculture and Cooperatives Deputy Minister Daniel Kayenga said here that the government would not entertain abuse of the program.

Speaking at the national launch of the 60 percent subsidy support program, Kayenga said that misapplication of the program would defeat the government's effort to improve household and national food security in the country.

The government has targeted 1.5 million farmers to benefit from the program for 2006/2007 farming season countrywide, he said.

Kayenga called upon the private sector to assist the government in the provision of finances to the farmers as the government alone could not manage to meet the financial requirements of the farmers.

Earlier, Kapiri Mposhi District Commissioner Jeston mulando appealed to the government to increase the number of farming inputs for the district.

Mulando said that the 432,000 bag of fertilizer meant for the district is inadequate to cater for the growing number of farmers in the area.

Zambian government has allocated 198 billion kwacha (about 51 million U.S. dollars) for the implementation of the 2006/2007 fertilizer support program.

The government provides subsidized fertilizer for the small scale farmers since 2002 to encourage agriculture production.
