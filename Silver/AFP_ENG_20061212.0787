An Indonesian court has sentenced a Muslim militant to three years in jail for storing explosives used in the 2004 suicide bombing of the Australian embassy here, a court clerk said Wednesday.

Twelve people, including the bomber, were killed when an explosives-laden van exploded in front of the mission on September 5, 2004.

Judges at the state court in Surabaya, East Java, sentenced Ahmad Arif Hermansyah, 27, on Tuesday, a court clerk who identified himself only as Bambang told AFP.

"The panel of judges found him guilty of having intentionally assisted acts of terrorism and withholding information on act of terrorism," Bambang said, adding that the defendant and his lawyers had filed an appeal.

The sentence was two years lighter than what the prosecution had recommended.

Prosecutors had accused the defendant of agreeing to store a cardboard box for a friend, who was tried separately, but failing to ask what it contained.

Prosecutors said it contained explosives later used in the embassy attack. They also told the court the defendant had been an active member of the Jemaah Islamiyah militant network in 1997.

Jemaah Islamiyah is accused of being behind a series of bombings and other attacks in Indonesia and the region in the past years, including the 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people.
