Taiwan will not change its pig-rearing policy despite the outbreak last month of foot-and-mouth disease, estimated to have slowed the country's economic growth rate by 0.5 percent this year.

"Don't randomly change a policy whenever a problem occurs," Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui said at the end of a regular meeting of the decision-making Central Standing Committee.

"Changes to policy should be made only after they are carefully studied by scholars and experts ... Only so doing will government policies become more healthy," added Lee, who is also the ruling Kuomintang party's chairman.

There have been widespread calls for a thorough government review of pig raising following the island's worst pig disease in 80 years.

Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said the plague, which was threatening the jobs of 700,000 workers, is estimated to have dragged economic growth by 0.5 percentage points from a previously forecast 6.3 percent for this year.

The government has banned exports of 105 categories of fresh and processed meat products, inflicting huge losses on the 1.6 billion US dollar a year industry.

Total losses to the pork industry and related businesses could reach an estimated 270 billion Taiwan dollars (almost 10 billion US).

Lee said it was not right for Taiwan to pull out of the overseas market only because of the pig epidemic, or it would be hard for the local pig-raisers to take back the market share they lost to competitors.

Lee, who received a doctorate degree in agroeconomy from Cornell University of the United States, took pride in Taiwan's rice-growing and pig-raising techniques which he said were "first class in the world."

Lee, Vice President Lien Chan and other ranking government officials ate pig knuckles and pork at a press promotion campaign on the heels of the KMT meeting.

They urged the public to consume pork, saying the pork available on the market was not tainted.

Meanwhile, 30 parliamentarians on Wednesday endorsed a bi-partisan resolution demanding two top agricultural officials step down to shoulder responsibility for the agricultural disaster.
