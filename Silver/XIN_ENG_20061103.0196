Iran's Revolutionary Guards test fired three new models of missiles in the ongoing military exercises in the Gulf region, the state-run television reported on Friday.

The television footage showed the missiles were fired from mobile launching carriers on the shore and from warships, and the missiles hit the targets successfully.

According to the report, the new types of missiles, dubbed Nasr, Noor and Kowsar, had been extended of their range and now could cover a range of 170 km.

The missiles are made by Iran itself and could be used in land- to-sea or sea-to-sea warfare, and due to the extension of their range, the missiles are able to hit all potential targets anywhere in the Gulf region and in the sea of Oman, said the report.

"The missiles are suitable to cover all the Strait of Hormuz, the Gulf and the sea of Oman," said Admiral Sardar Fadavi, the deputy navy chief of the Revolutionary Guards.

Iran started a new round of military maneuvers Thursday, during which the Revolutionary Guards also test fired ballistic Shahab-3 missiles with a range of more than 2,000 km.

Major General Seyed Yahya Rahim Safavi, commander-in-chief of the Revolution Guards, said on Wednesday that the 10-day military maneuvers, dubbed "The Great Prophet 2," would be carried out in the Gulf waters, the sea of Oman and 14 provinces of the country.

But he did not disclose the number of Iranian troops participating the drills.

Iran's maneuver was carried out shortly after the U.S.-led naval forces staged a two-day maneuver in the Gulf waters aimed at blocking smuggling of nuclear weaponry material and arms proliferation.

Iranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham said on Monday that foreign military forces should not damage Gulf peace, saying durable peace and security would be restored through collective cooperation of all countries of the region.

This is the third round of military exercise in Iran this year, the country launched a large-scale military maneuver named " Zolfaghar Blow" in August, and the other drill named "The Great Prophet 1" was also staged in April, during which Iranian army said that it tested advanced weapons including missiles and torpedoes.
