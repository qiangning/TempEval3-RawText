The United States on Tuesday called Saddam Hussein's confirmed death sentence "a milestone" for Iraqis and said the "tyrant" had received a fair trial.

"Today marks a milestone for Iraqi people's efforts to replace the rule of a tyrant with the rule of law," Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman, said.

"Saddam has received due process and the legal rights that he denied the Iraqi people," he said.

"The Iraqis deserve praise for continuing to utilize the institutions of democracy to pursue justice," the spokesman told reporters traveling with President George W. Bush aboard the presidential jet Air Force One to Texas.

Bush was to spend the final days of the year at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.

Earlier Tuesday an Iraqi appeals court judge announced that Saddam would be hanged within 30 days, after confirming the former strongman's sentence for crimes against humanity.

Speaking to reporters in Baghdad, Judge Arif Shaheen said the verdict was final and legally binding on Iraq's government, which now has a month to get Saddam and two co-defendants to the gallows.

"This is an important day for the Iraqi people," Stanzel said without commenting on the sentence itself.

Stanzel said a written judgment against Saddam should be available "soon." "So we look forward, as does the rest of the world, to seeing that written judgment," he said.

The Iraqi confirmation of the death penalty for Saddam came as Bush, under pressure from surging violence in Iraq and rising American opposition to the war, prepared a new way forward for the country as it sinks closer to civil war.

Bush was due to announce a new US strategy for Iraq after January 1, the White spokesman reminded reporters.

"He continues to ask questions of his advisors and ... trying to make sure that all options and all ideas are given the due consideration they need, trying to think through the consequences of any actions and of those options."
