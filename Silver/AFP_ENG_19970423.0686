The Indonesian military has promised a reward to anyone who providing information about a notorious rebel leader in the easternmost Irian Jaya province, a report said Thursday.

Major General Johny Lumintang, responsible for security in the province, said in the province's capital of Jayapura Wednesday that the military will provide "an attractive reward" for information on the whereabouts of Kelly Kwalik, one of the leaders of the Free Papua Organisation (OPM).

"If anyone knows anything, please let me know so that he could be captured immediately," Lumintang said without elaborating as quoted by the state Antara news agency.

The OPM has been seeking an independent state in Irian Jaya, which shares a border with Papua New Guinea, since the late 1960s.

Kwalik's group in January last year kidnapped 26 people, including seven European scientists, in the mountainous jungle area in central Irian Jaya.

They gradually released most of the hostages until the remaining nine, including seven foreigners, were freed four months later following a military operation in May. Two Indonesian hostages were killed in the operation.

Central Irian Jaya is mostly covered by mountainous jungles and experiences heavy rainfall and temperatures as low as ten degrees Celcius (minus 12 degrees Fahrenheit).
