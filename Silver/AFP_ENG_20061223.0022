A colonel in the Preventive Security force loyal to president Mahmud Abbas was wounded in a shooting ambush in the southern Gaza Strip early Saturday, witnesses and emergency services said.

Colonel Hassan Gardua was driving to work in the town of Rafah hard by the Egyptian border when the gunman or gunmen opened fire on his vehicle.

The attack came on the fourth day of a fragile ceasefire between Abbas's secular Fatah faction and the Islamist movement Hamas which leads the government.

The truce, which came after four days of streetfighting in Gaza killed 14 people and wounded dozens, had already suffered minor breaches.

A civilian died on Thursday night in eastern Gaza City in clashes between Hamas and a powerful local clan.
