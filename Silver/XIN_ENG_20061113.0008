Twenty-four people were confirmed dead and 10 others went missing in a deadly coal mine accident early Monday in north China's Shanxi Province.

Thirty-four miners were trapped when the accident occurred at 4:00 a.m. at the Nanshan Colliery in Wangyu Village of Lingshi County, said Gong Anku, head of the provincial administration for work safety.

Rescuers had found 24 dead bodies by midday and were continuing to search for the other 10, he said.

A spokesman of the Lingshi county government said the accident was caused by improper use of explosives that led to combustion in the pit.

Gong said Nanshan Colliery was a village-run coal mine. The safety watchdog is yet to find out if it holds a production permit.

Also on Monday, the death toll in another deadly accident in this coal-rich province climbed to 35, with 12 more missing in the pit of the Jiaojiazhai Colliery in Xinzhou, where a gas blast trapped 47 on Nov. 5.
