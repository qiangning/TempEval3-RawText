A 24-hour general strike on Wednesday paralysed the Greek public and private sectors and severely restricted air, sea and rail travel across the country, as the country's two biggest trade unions took to the streets to protest against government fiscal policy.

All aircraft were to be grounded for four hours on Wednesday from noon (1000 GMT) because of action by air traffic controllers.

Flight disruptions were to continue until Thursday, with national carrier Olympic Airlines expecting to cancel 35 flights to foreign destinations and 75 internal flights over the next two days.

Olympic said it would operate one flight a day to each domestic destination and one flight a day to each foreign destination.

Another Greek carrier, Aegean Airlines, said it will cancel a flight to Cyprus and seven domestic flights and will change the timings of 27 of its departures on Wednesday.

The Wednesday strike by the General Confederation of Workers (GSEE) and the Union of Civil Servants (ADEDY) -- which number some 800,000 members among them -- was also expected to cripple shipping, ground intercity trains and halt Athens' public transport systems.

The Athens metro was to operate between 11 am and 4 pm to enable people to join demonstrations planned for 1 pm.

Banks, hospitals and schools would also remain closed because of the strike, which also brought a four-hour break in media coverage.

The unions are protesting against government spending plans and proposals to alter the status of staff working for large public companies.

Police and firefighters carried out their own street protest on Tuesday evening, marching on parliament to demand a hazardous pay bonus.
