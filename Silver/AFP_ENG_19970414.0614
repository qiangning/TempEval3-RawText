A cardiologist who visited the 72 hostages held in the Japanese ambassador's residence here said Monday that those with heart problems were in good physical shape.

"I would say that the patients in my area of specialty, cardiovascular medicine, are all being well treated," Dr. Miguel Sanchez told Peruvian radio.

Sanchez, a former hostage who has entered the compound periodically since the crisis began December 17, spoke as the hostages completed their 118th day as captives of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).

Two of the hostages who suffer from heart problems are Bolivia's ambassador to Peru, Jorge Gumucio, and Moises Pantoja, former president of the Peruvian Supreme Court.

Sanchez spent three hours with the hostages Monday and said that the only problem he noticed is that some of them appear to have put on weight.

But others have taken to exercise and "now are in much better physical shape than before," he said.

On Monday Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori met with top hostage mediator Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani in an attempt to find a solution to the crisis.

"There are small advances towards a good end," Cipriani said.

The MRTA wants the government to free some 400 imprisoned comrades, and wants improved prison conditions. Fujimori said he will release no prisoners.

The last face-to-face meeting between the government and the rebels came March 12, after which negotiations broke off when the rebel commando said that security forces were digging a tunnel into the residence.

Since then, mediators have shuttled between the government palace and the residence, trying to gain concessions from the two sides to end the crisis.
