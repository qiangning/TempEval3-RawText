An experimental vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline that targets two viruses responsible for 70 percent of uterine cancer cases triggers twice the immune response in girls aged 10 to 14 than in those aged 15 to 24, the British pharmaceutical firm said Saturday.

The results of phase 3 clinical trials were presented at an annual conference on infectious diseases under way this weekend in Washington.

They indicate that the vaccine Cervarix could offer more durable and efficient protection, if it is given to the young, well ahead of their becoming sexually active.

"Vaccination of pre-teen/adolescent girls against cancer-causing HPV (Human Papillomavirus) before onset of sexual activity will be an important part of the overall strategy for cervical cancer prevention," said Anna-Barbara Moscicki, a pediatrics professor from the University of California.

The two viruses are responsible for 70 percent of cases of uterine cancer. More than 500,000 cases of this disease are diagnosed in the world each year.

The clinical trials conducted by Glaxo in Europe and Russia involved 158 girls aged between 10 and 14 and 458 women aged between 15 and 25. Each of them received three doses of the vaccine over a period of six months.

Cervarix, which has not been introduced to the market yet, is one of the company's most important new drugs.

GlaxoSmithKline's American competitor Merck is waiting for the green light to start marketing its own vaccine called Gardasil.

The conference organized by American Society for Microbiology has brought together some 9,000 researchers from about 80 countries of the world.
