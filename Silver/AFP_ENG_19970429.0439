A 23-year-old Spaniard was sentenced on Tuesday to 16 years in prison for killing his fiancee in a plot he tried to pass off as a "remake" of the tragic ending of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliette.

Jose Maria Gomez Lopez, nicknamed Romeo of Terrassa since the killing in 1996, tried to pass off as a suicide the killing of his fiancee Gema Aguda, 17, who at the time was threatening to leave him.

Gomez Lopez sent the woman's parents a letter on February, 6, 1996, imitating her writing and announcing that the couple planned to commit suicide.

The following night he suffocated Aguda with a pillow and then called police to alert them to a double suicide after scattering some pills on the floor and feigning a deep sleep.

The plot, however, did not fool investigators.
