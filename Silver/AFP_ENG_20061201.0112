US officials are looking into ending reconciliation efforts with Sunni insurgents as part of the ongoing review of US policy in Iraq, the Washington Post reported Friday, citing anonymous government officials.

The proposal, presented by the State Department, follows an internal review that says US efforts to reach out to Sunni dissidents have failed, the Post reported.

Such efforts may even have backfired and alienated Iraqi Shiites, the review said.

US policy up to now has been to support a unified Iraq based on its three main communities -- the Shiites, the Sunnis and the Kurds. Washington would not drop the goal, but instead would let the Iraqis take leadership in reconciliation efforts, the Post reported.

US ambassador in Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad and top military commanders believe that bringing Sunni insurgents into the political process is key to stabilizing the country, and strongly oppose the effort, according to the Post.

Sunnis, favored during Saddam Hussein's regime and for centuries the backbone of the ruling elite and middle class, make up about 20 percent of Iraq's population.
