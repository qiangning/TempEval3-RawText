Software companies Tuesday launched a campaign to track down big Philippine firms using pirated software with a reward of 50,000 pesos (1,900 dollars) to anyone giving incriminating information.

The Business Software Alliance (BSA), an association of information technology firms, said corporate end users account for two-thirds of software piracy losses in the Philippines.

"We are committed to eradicating corporate end user piracy even as we continue to pursue our enforcement action against dealers" who sell pirated software, said Stuart Ong, vice-president of BSA.

Ong said the alliance would encourage past and present employees of big companies to report use of pirated software.

A BSA statement said those who assist them will be compensated while remaining anonymous. It estimated that 90 percent of the software in use in this country was pirated.
