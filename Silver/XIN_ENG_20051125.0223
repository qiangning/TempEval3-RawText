The Southern African Development Community is making a great effort to fight HIV/AIDS which continues to be one of the major challenges in the region, the SADC executive secretary Tomaz Salomao said here on Friday.

Speaking at a press conference, Salomao said the SADC secretariat has organized a number of initiatives at the regional level to benefit member states, which included regional training workshops on mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS, nutrition, prevention of mother to child transmission and behavior change.

He said a platform has also been created for member states to share best practices through the regional and national AIDS forums.

Over and above the regional initiatives, the secretariat has also been supporting a number of initiatives related to the areas and with the cooperation of a number of cooperating partners, said Salomao.

He said the total support for activities related to the strengthening of behavioral change communication, condom promotion and use, support to people living with HIV/AIDS as well as capacity for coordination of the national AIDS response is about 2. 4 million US dollars.

Salomao disclosed that SADC and the International Cooperating Partners HIV/AIDS Group on November 9 of this year signed a 5.3 million-US dollar financing agreement to help the HIV/AIDS unit in building capacity and to assist member states in dealing with HIV/ AIDS.

This is a joint financial technical memorandum signed by Sweden, Netherlands and Britain.

Salomao also called for SADC member states to strengthen cooperation to fight against HIV/AIDS.

Salomao arrived in Zimbabwe on Thursday after visiting Namibia, Madagascar, Swaziland, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The purpose of his visit is to get first hand information on what member states expect from the secretariat and exchange views and ideas on regional cooperation and integration issues.
