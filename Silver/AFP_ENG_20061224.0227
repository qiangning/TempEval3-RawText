California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger faces surgery to repair his fractured leg, his office said Sunday, one day after the former action hero's Christmas holiday skiing accident.

"Saturday morning while skiing with his family in Sun Valley, Idaho, Governor Schwarzenegger suffered a fracture to his right femur," said Adam Mendelsohn, Schwarzenegger's Deputy Chief of Staff, in a statement.

"After the accident the governor was taken to a local hospital for x-rays and was soon discharged. He is currently at his home in Sun Valley, Idaho with his family."

Mendelsohn said no one else was involved in the accident.

"When the Governor returns to Los Angeles from his scheduled Christmas trip, he will have surgery to repair his femur," the spokesman said.
