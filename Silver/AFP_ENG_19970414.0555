The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) appeared set to keep its majority in the upper house of parliament, according to figures broadcast by television Monday, while polling closed in the troubled Eastern Slavonia region.

With almost all votes in after Sunday's elections, the television said that the ruling party was expected to win 41 seats of the 63 up for election in the 68-seat House of Counties.

However polling stations in Eastern Slavonia closed a day late after Sunday's chaos where incomplete voter registration lists and missing ballot papers led the UN to allow a second day's voting.

The vote in the region is being seen as a key step in restoring Zagreb's control in a region that separatist Serbs captured in bitter fighting in 1991.

Local Serb leader Vojislav Stanimirovic, who hinted on Sunday the Serbs might not recognise the polls, said he was pleased at the efforts made by the UN to ensure the vote was fair.

"Yesterday, there were many reasons for calling for the elections to be annulled but many things have been done to correct these irregularities and for this reason we can say that these elections have been democratic," he said.

People were allowed to vote with just a Croatian identity card while those who had yet to receive such cards were allowed to pick them up during Monday.

US ambassador Peter Galbraith said that the elections in Eastern Slavonia had been fair.

"Nobody is going to say that these were perfect elections but they were fair ... All the people from the region had a chance to cast their vote," he told a press conference, estimating the turnout at around 85 percent.

The ambassador is one of the architects of a November 1995 accord between Zagreb and the rebel Serbs under which Eastern Slavonia is being returned to Croatian control.

The local, regional and upper house elections are a key step in that process. They are being organised by the UN mission in the region, whose mandate is due to end on July 15.

UN chief Jacques Klein said he expected turnout in Eastern Slavonia of up to 90 percent.

He said he was "confident that the elections will be able to be certified as being full, fair and honest," and cited "the calm atmosphere, and the fact that the polls were open until the last voter." Final certification could take four or five days, a spokesman for Klein said.

In the rest of Croatia, where voting ended Sunday, results were pouring in from the 21 regions which will each send three members to the 68 seat upper house. The five other deputies are appointed by President Franjo Tudjman. Two of these are to be Serb candidates.

Croatian television said that the Croatian Peasants' Party (HSS) would get nine seats, the Croatian Social and Liberal Party (HSLS) seven, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) four and the Istrian Democratic Party (IDS) two.

Preliminary unofficial results Monday afternoon, with much of the vote counted, Tudjman's HDZ to be the leading party in 19 regions, including one where it was in a coalition with other parties.

Tudjman, quoted by Croatian radio, said he expected an HDZ victory. However, given the proportional electoral system, the effect on the seats in the upper house was not immediately clear.

In Zagreb, opposition parties won a slim majority on the 50 seat city council, a key battleground with the ruling party, according to preliminary results announced in the afternoon.

The local electoral commission said the HDZ would have 24 seats, the opposition Social Democratic Party 14, the opposition Croatian Social and Liberal Party (HSLS) nine and the Croatian Peasants' Party three.

After elections in 1995, the opposition parties controlled the city council, but a crisis ensued when Tudjman four times rejected their choice of mayor, before dissolving the council in April, drawing international criticism.

Croatia is due to go to the polls within months for presidential elections in which Tudjman, 74, is a favourite to win a third term.
