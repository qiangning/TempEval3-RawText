The first MTN one-day international between South African and Indian cricket teams at the Wanderers in Johannesburg was called off on Sunday due to persistent rain.

About 30,000 people had braved the elements, hoping to see some action. It was overcast in the morning, but rain started falling just before the toss at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT), and the covers were brought on.

The main covers came on and off several times during the afternoon because of the rain. At 6.30 p.m. (1630 GMT), it was announced that the match had officially been called off.

The opening match had not been without its problems. Originally scheduled as a day match, the organizers had to change it to a day-night affair because of the Pick'n Pay 94.7 Cycle Challenge, which took place earlier in the day.

Several major roads in Johannesburg were closed for the cycle race, in which 28,000 cyclists took part, and access to the Wanderers would have been difficult.

The next match is a day-night match at Kingsmead in Durban on Wednesday afternoon.
