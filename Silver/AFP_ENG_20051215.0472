European Union leaders were to discover the pleasures of Cullen Skink when they sit down to dinner Thursday to haggle over EU financial perspectives.

It's a hearty smoked-haddock soup from Scotland -- Cullen is a coastal town and skink comes from the Gaelic word for essence -- that British Prime Minister Tony Blair hopes can help warm the mood.

Anyone wanting to spoil the mood could point out that Scotland's fisheries have been hit hard by EU fisheries policy, with tough quotas now in place after years of overfishing in the North Sea.

The two-day summit in Brussels is dominated by intense wrangling over the bloc's budget for 2007 to 2013, but the dinner itself is likely to be a more harmonious occasion.

The main course, a European diplomat told AFP, would be "carre d'agneau" -- that reads better on a menu than "lamb chops" -- from Northern Ireland, accompanied with cabbage and mushrooms.

A selection of British cheeses and oatcakes was to follow, together with coffee and, in a return to things Scottish, shortbread.

To wash it all down, there was to be Sharpham Beenleigh red wine from Devon, southwest England, and Tintern Parva white from Wales, as well as mineral water from Shropshire, in the north of England.

Coffee and shortbread was to round out the evening.
