Shaquille O'Neal may miss two to four weeks with a sprained right ankle during Thursday's team loss to Indiana in Miami.

O'Neal, who flew with his team to Milwaukee on Friday, learned results of an MRI exam performed earlier in the day.

The 12-time All-Star was getting in position for an offensive rebound when he stepped on Ron Artest's foot and rolled the ankle midway through the fourth quarter of the Heat's 102-105 loss. X-rays did not reveal a fracture, but O'Neal left the arena on crutches.

The Heat will turn to Alonzo Mourning to start at center, with undrafted rookie Earl Barron the likely choice to be the first center off the bench.

"You never want one of your best players going down with an injury," Van Gundy was quoted as saying. "It's all also part of the game. We're already dealing with three veteran guys out, now a fourth veteran guy out, so some of these young guys are going to have to step up and play."

James Posey will probably miss a few more games because of an injured thumb, reserve forward Shandon Anderson has been sidelined by back spasms and isn't traveling with the team and backup center Michael Doleac hasn't made his season debut yet because of an injured calf.

O'Neal averaged 15 points and six rebounds in Miami's first two games. He missed nine regular-season games and two playoff games last year because of various injuries. The Heat went 8-3 without O'Neal last season.
