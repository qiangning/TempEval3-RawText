Men's 3000m steeplechase world record holder Saif Saaeed Shaheen made a shock withdrawal Thursday from the 15th Asian Games, which leaves the Qatari fans no chance of seeing the athletics star of their own.

Shaheen set the current 3000m steeplechase world record of 7:53. 63 in 2004 and won the world title twice for Qatar in 2003 and 2005 respectively.

He made history this year by winning double in the 3000m steeplechase and the 5000m at the World Cup in Athens. He is the most favored candidate in both of the events at Asiad if not for the sudden exit.

Shaheen set the Asian record of 7:56.63 in the 5000m and also won the 3000m title at the Asian Indoor Athletics Championships in Pattaya City of Thailand.

Shaheen's title roster is void of only the Asian and Olympic champions. His opportunity to win in Athens 2004 was deprived for Kenya Olympic Committee's insistence of a three-year delay for his nationality transformation to Qatar in 2003. The pullout of Doha 2006 postponed Shaheen's bid of winning the Asian title.

Shaheen's rise began in 1999 when he was running for Kenya by winning the world youth steeplechase title. In 2001, he lowered the world junior 3000m steeplechase record to 7:58.66. He won the Kenya national 3000m steeplechase title in 2002 and then grabbed the Commonwealth Games gold in Manchester the same year.

The absence of Shaheen also leaves opportunities for the other athletes, including his countrymen Gamal Belal Salem of Qatar, who ranked third in Asian steeplechase this year, and the 2005 world youth steeplechase champion Tareq Mubarak Salem of Bahrain.

At the IAAF Super Grand Prix in Doha in 2005, Shaheen set the second fastest time in history over the 2000m steeplechase, clocking 5:14.57.

China's Liu Xiang is now the only world record holder in athletics who will compete in Doha. Liu broke Briton Colin Jackson 's 110m hurdles record when he ran 12.88 seconds in Lausanne in July 2006.
