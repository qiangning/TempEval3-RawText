Chinese President Hu Jintao said here Saturday the fact that China had realized the great jump from one-person-one-day space flight to multi-person-multi-day space mission within two years has marked a new landmark victory in China's manned space technology.

Hu made the remarks at a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to mark the great success of Shenzhou VI mission.
