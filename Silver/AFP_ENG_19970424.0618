The hostages freed from the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima Friday reiterated claims elite Peruvian troops executed rebels captured alive and unarmed during the assault, according to press reports here.

According to several ex-hostages held for four months by the Tupac Amaru (MRTA) revolutionary movement, at least two rebels were executed by the soldiers after being taken prisoner.

One of the two was first led into a building next to the Japanese ambassador's residence in the assault in Lima Tuesday, according to a front page report in the Mainichi Shimbun daily.

The former hostages, whose names have not been given, said the two rebels were disarmed when they were captured. When the assault started one of the two, Ernesto "Tito" Cruz, took off his jacket, which had attached to it several handgrenades.

He then lay on the floor alongside the hostages as the elite troops stormed the residence. He was taken prisoner and his hands were tied with cord as he was taken away, according to the former hostages.

A young female rebel was also captured alive on the first floor of the residence.

She shouted "Don't shoot him!" but the hostages said those around her did not understand what this meant.

On Thursday the freed hostages told the daily Asahi Shimbun they saw rebels killed by the Peruvian forces after they had given themselves up.

"I saw a murder," one of the hostages said. He told how one rebel put his hands in the air but was nevertheless shot.

Another hostage said he saw a rebel captured alive by the Peruvian forces who led him away.

"I realised the rebel they had taken had been shot when I heard all 14 rebels died in the assault," he said.

All 14 rebels, two soldiers and one hostage died during the assault.
