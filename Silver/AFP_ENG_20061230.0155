The body of former President Gerald Ford will be flown to the US capital Saturday as part of a nationwide programme of memorials, which got underway with a simple family ceremony in California.

Ford, a Republican president from August 1974 to January 1977 who led the United States out of the turbulent Watergate era after Richard Nixon stepped down in disgrace in 1974, died late Tuesday aged 93.

The body will lie in state at the US Capitol until early next Tuesday when a memorial service will take place at the National Cathedral here.

On Wednesday, Ford's remains are finally laid to rest at the Gerald Ford Museum in his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Flags on federal buildings have been flying at half mast since Ford's death was announced, and President George W. Bush has declared January 2 as a national day of mourning.

Hundreds of Washington-based police officers have been mobilized for the New Year's weekend as part of a plan to bolster security at key locations throughout the city.

Friday's prayer service in Palm Desert, California, was held for family and friends of the 38th US president at St Margaret's Episcopal Church, which Ford and his wife Betty had attended for decades.

In accordance with Ford's wishes and in keeping with his down-to-earth, self-effacing image, there was little of the pomp and circumstance which have been the hallmark of other presidential funerals.

A motorcade carrying Ford's remains was greeted by an honour guard at around 12:30 pm (2030 GMT) Friday with members of the military carrying his casket -- draped with the Stars and Stripes -- into the church.

A military band played "Hail to the Chief" as the casket arrived at the church, awaited by former first lady Betty Ford, 88, and her children at the top of the church steps as it was carried into the building.

"We receive the body of our brother, Gerald, for burial," said the church's rector, Reverend Robert Certain.

Betty Ford, escorted by an army general, stood silently as the casket was laid before a wooden altar and three wreaths of white flowers before joining other family members at the President's Pew.

The funeral arrangements are taking place under blanket security, with an estimated 500 military and Secret Service officials descending on Palm Desert to oversee Friday's leg of the ceremonies.

Thousands of members of the public queued for the chance to pay their respects to Ford as his casket lay in repose in Palm Desert on Friday.

On Wall Street, the major stock exchanges said they would close next Tuesday as a mark of respect for Ford, who is best remembered for pardoning Nixon, a decision for which he was vilified.

Some historians have since said that the move was a brave political act by Ford, necessary to help Americans draw a line under the trauma of Watergate.

"My NYSE Group colleagues and I join all Americans in mourning the loss of president Ford, a man of great integrity and vision, and a dedicated public servant," NYSE Group chief executive John Thain said in a statement.

"He assumed a troubled presidency in a critical time, and thoughtfully and skillfully restored credibility and confidence in the presidency.

"President Ford also made significant contributions to the stability and vitality of the US economy and financial markets. It is appropriate that we honor president Ford and celebrate the life of a truly great American."
