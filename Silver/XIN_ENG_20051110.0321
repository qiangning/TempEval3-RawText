The presidents of Croatia, Slovenia on Thursday agreed to cooperate in solving the border dispute between the two former Yugoslav countries, the Croatian news agency reported.

"I believe a solution could be found if experts from both countries sat down at the negotiating table and, unburdened by politics, determined the land border with the help of existing documents, if our government accepts that way of dealing with this issue," Croatian President Stjepan Mesic said.

Mesic and his Slovenian counterpart Janez Drnovsek had an informal meeting on Thursday in the Croatian border town of Miljana. This is the second informal meeting between the two presidents this year.

The border dispute can be solved by freezing the current situation, finding a transitional solution, or having it settled before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Mesic said.

"Once the land border is identified, the sea border can be identified with mathematical precision by applying international conventions," Mesic said, reiterating that this would be the best solution.

If this approach fails, the matter should be settled by an international court or through arbitration, Mesic added.

President Drnovsek said that a bilateral agreement on the border issue would be the best solution, but that the two countries should turn to the International Court of Justice if they proved unable to solve the dispute bilaterally

"We don't want to be part of the problem, we want to be part of the solution and help the EU solve some other issues in Southeast Europe which are much more complex," Drnovsek said.
