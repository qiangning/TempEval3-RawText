Pakistan's defence ministry Sunday dismissed Indian reports of an alarming increase in cross border firing in the disputed Kashmir state.

"It is a ploy to divert attention" from the turbulence in Indian-held Kashmir, a ministry official said.

"There is no unusual situation" as skirmishes have routinely occurred along the Line of Control dividing Pakistani- and Indian-held sections of the disputed Himalayan state, the defence ministry sources said.

Pakistan controls the northern third of Kashmir while the rest is administered by New Delhi.

Officials in Jammu, the winter capital of the Indian held part of the state, earlier said Indian troops were placed on high alert along the Kashmir frontier as they traded fire with Pakistani forces for the fourth successive day Sunday.

One official alleged that Pakistani troops "using heavy artillery stepped up attacks on Indian villages near the Kargil sector."

"We have retaliated. No one was injured (Sunday)," he said.

Two Indians, including a child, were reported killed and eight others injured Saturday in the shooting between the two sides.

India and Pakistan dispute the ownership of the state. The two countries have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.

A Kashmiri separatist movement in Indian-held territory has claimed some 20,000 lives since 1989.
