The President of the Cabinda Forum for Dialogue (FCD), Antnio Bento Bembe has called for the adhesion to the peace process underway in the region.

According to Angola Press Agency ANGOP on Wednesday, the FCD president appealed for the contribution of people with good faith for the consolidation of peace in the heroic province.

"The time is for reconciliation; let us forget the past," he said.

He considered positive the first phase of implementing the Memorandum of Peace, defending with the fact that 95 percent of the troops have already been stationed.

Cabinda, which produces 60 percent of Angola's oil, is a sliver of land sandwiched between the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

An armed conflict for secession led by the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) has occurred in the territory since Angola's independence in 1975. In 2004, FLEC, the Church and others set up the FCD to enter into dialogue with the Angolan central government for peace in Cabinda.

The Angolan government and FCD signed the memorandum of understanding for peace on August 1 this year.

Bembe said that at the moment his board is working for the closing of the first phase, which will end with the integration of FLEC soldiers in the Angolan Armed Forces and in the National Police.
