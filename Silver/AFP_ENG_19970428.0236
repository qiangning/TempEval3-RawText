Italy's centre-left coalition appears to have just held its ground against the right in the first round of partial local elections, and looks more dependent than ever on its Marxist allies.

The Olive Tree coalition had hoped for a vote of confidence from the Sunday poll, in which one-fifth of the electorate voted in around 1,000 municipalities, including the major northern cities of Milan, Turin and Trieste.

Counting began Monday morning and final results will be published later in the day.

However, exit polls gave an indication of the overall trends, which suggested a left-right polarisation in Italian politics.

The Refounded Communist Party, the Marxist party which supports the government without participating in it, made a particularly strong showing.

Also notable was a disastrous performance by the secessionist Northern League.

In Milan, Italy's economic powerhourse, and the only city controlled by the league, outgoing mayor Marco Formentini was soundly defeated.

Formentini came in in third place and will not take part in a second round of voting on May 11.

Leading the poll was centre-right Freedom Alliance candidate Gabriele Albertini while Olive Tree hopeful Aldo Fumagalli came in second, exit polls indicated.

The Refounded Communist Party candidate won 9.2 percent.

The coalition was more hopeful of holding onto Turin and Trieste.

However in Turin, capital of the automobile industry, outgoing Olive Tree mayor Valentino Castellani was forced into second place by right- wing candidate Raffaele Costa. Costa took around 43.5 percent of the vote to Castellani's 34 percent.

In Trieste, centre-left mayor Ricardo Illy came in well in front with 38 percent of the vote, but will face one of two centre-right candidates who each took about 21.7 percent in the second round.

Elsewhere, the left won the central cities of Sienna and Ravenna outright, as well as the northern town of Belluno.

In the south, in Reggio di Calabria, outgoing centre-left mayor was leading and also likely to win in a single round. In Catanzaro, the outgoing right-wing mayor was ahead, but will face a centre-left candidate in the second round.

The polls also chose local councillors according to lists submitted by the parties.

According to exit polls, both the Refounded Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the main party in the ruling coalition, made gains.

However centrist parties suffered a major defeat.

Italian newspapers highlighted the success of the Refounded Communist Party and advances by the right.

La Stampa noted the Marxists' "spectacular ability to lead the dance" and said this would "complicate the task of the government."

La Repubblica said Olive Tree was "a minority without the Refounded Communists," while noting it would "govern with difficulty" with the Marxists.
