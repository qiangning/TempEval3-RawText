The government has suspended 16 customs officials from service for allegedly helping tax evasion on palm oil imports from Malaysia, the official Associated Press (APP) reported late Monday.

The officials have been accused of causing revenue loss of hundreds of millions of rupees (millions of dollars) in collusion with a businessman, the agency said.

Palm oil shipments from Malaysia had been unloaded directly to a private warehouse at the Karachi port and secretly moved out from there for many years until the affair came to light in 1993, APP said.

The government is contacting Interpol to track down the businessman who is currently out of Pakistan, the agency said.

Last week the government suspended 87 senior officers in a drive initiated by newly elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to purge the administration of corrupt elements.

The government has also offered rewards for citizens for information leading to unearthing of ill-gotten wealth owned by any government official.
