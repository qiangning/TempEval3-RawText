The Bangladesh Supreme Court Tuesday temporarily stayed a High Court order requiring the government to compensate four opposition leaders who had been detained illegally, court officials said.

Judge Latifur Rahman Chowdhury issued the stay following a petition filed by the government a day after the High Court ordered the release of the four Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leaders.

The court, in an unprecedented move, also ordered the government to pay 100,000 taka (2,325 dollars) to each BNP leader as compensation.

The Supreme Court will hear the government petition against the compensation order in six weeks.

Three of the leaders - Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Abdul Mannan and Mirza Abbas - were freed hours after the court order on Monday but the fourth, Goeswar Roy, was still being detained as he is also wanted on other matters.

All four were arrested on March 20 under the Special Powers Act of 1974 for "subversive activities" following a series of disruptions in the power distribution system blamed on "sabotage" by the government.

The Act allows detention without specific charges for 120 days, but those arrested can file writ petitions to the High Court against the detention.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed was criticised for using the hated act to detain the four, but on Monday she reiterated the charges at a rally of her ruling Awami League party.

She also referred to a report of the London-based Amnesty International, saying the BNP under former premier Khaleda Zia arrested more than 8,500 people, including journalists, in 1995 alone.
