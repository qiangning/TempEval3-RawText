Sections of five Beijing and eight Tianjin highways are currently closed after thick fog smothered north China from Sunday night.

The highway from Beijing to Shenyang, capital of China's northeastern Liaoning Province, didn't reopen until 9:33 a.m on Monday.

The closure of highways caused congestion and a slow crawl of vehicles on National Route 107, said an official from the Dujiakan toll station.

Passengers for Baoding and Shijiazhuang, the two largest cities in northern Hebei province, were waiting in Liuliqiao bus station on Monday morning for their buses -- delayed by the closure of the highway -- to leave.

The Beijing Municipal Observatory and neighbouring Tianjin Municipal Observatory issued yellow fog warnings on Monday.

City roads were also affected by fog, with police called out repeatedly to deal with congestion and accidents.

Visibility was reported to be as low as 500 meters in Beijing.

Visibility is between 300 meters and 600 meters on average and as low as 10 meters on some road sections, said Zhao Jinghong, a weather forecaster with Tianjin Municipal Observatory.

Visibility at Beijing Capital International Airport fell to 600 meters, resulting in some flight delays, especially flights for eastern Shandong Province, according to the Beijing Municipal Observatory.

The airport has launched an emergency fog plan to avoid mass congestion at the airport. It increases intervals between flights and reminds travelers to check times before going to the airport, said an airport official.

There was some air pollution on Monday. People should scale back outdoor activities and go out with a respirator, said the local environmental bureau.

The price of tomatoes rose from 1 yuan to 1.8 yuan per kilo as vegetables from Shandong and Henan provinces, two major sources for Beijing's dinner tables, were kept out of the city by the fog.

There were 30 percent more faucitis, rhinitis and respiratory infection patients than usual at major Tianjin hospitals.

High humidity and little wind over the past week has caused the fog, said He Lifu, a meteorologist with the National Meteorology Center.

Cold air late on Monday night will bring fairly strong winds to north China and disperse the fog, the Beijing Municipal Observatory said.

Visibility in parts of east China's Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, north China's Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and northeastern China's Liaoning Province was a mere 200 meters.

More than 40 flights from Taoxian airport in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning, were delayed Sunday.
