The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Tuesday it had begun the registration of internally displaced Sudanese living in Khartoum who wants to return home after a peace agreement ended a 21-year-old civil war in the south.

In a statement issued in Nairobi, the organization said the registrations which will continue till next February, will allow the first rounds of organized returns to communities in southern Sudan, most likely next year.

About 100,000 households with an average size of six people per family are expected to register.

"As well as registering those IDPs (internally displaced persons) in Khartoum state who want to return home, IOM is also providing information and material assistance to the displaced, including facilitating transportation to destinations in the south, " it said.

"The Government of South Sudan and the United Nations have agreed that 150,000 people displaced in the north will be assisted through organized returns, with the IOM facilitating the transportation of 35,000 people," it added.

Another estimated 48,000 southern Sudanese IDPs, currently in southern Darfur and other states, will be assisted to go back home by the IOM between now and next July.

An estimated 4 million Sudanese are still displaced within their country as a result of the conflict in the south.
