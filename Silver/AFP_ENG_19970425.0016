India has disowned a foreign ministry official's allegations that Indian pilgrims who died in last week's Mecca disaster could have been saved, newspapers reported Friday.

The Hindustan Times said the foreign ministry had rejected the allegations by India's Consul General Afzal Amanullah in Jeddah following a blaze on April 15 which left at least 343 dead.

Amanullah claimed Indian pilgrims had been locked in their camp by their Saudi guides, condemning them to their fate. More than 100 Indians are believed to have died in the fire.

But a foreign ministry official said the consul general views appeared to be based on "information provided by a few of the injured relating to the conduct of an individual gatekeeper."

He said no pilgrims had made a complaint about a locked gate to an investigating team from India and it would be "premature to approportion blame."

He added: "No broad generalisations about the tragic accident can be drawn on this basis."

Saudi officials say the fire killed at least 343 people and left more than 1,500 wounded during the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca known as the hajj.

A preliminary Indian investigation, however, has indicated 600 may have died. Most of the victims were from Asian countries, notably India and Pakistan.

The Saudi authorities said the blaze, which incinerated 70,000 tents, was started accidently by the explosion of a gas canister used for cooking in the Pakistani pilgrims' camp.

Amanullah reportedly said there had been time to save the pilgrims, adding: "You do not prevent your own pilgrims from rushing out to safety. You do not confine them to a small space and certain death."

The Hindustan Times said the foreign ministry announcement had been made "apparently in deference to Saudi clout."

The Asian Age, in an unsourced front page article, accused the Indian government of a "soft approach", arguing India did not want to offend Saudi Arabia since many of its nationals worked there and it also relied on Saudi oil supplies.
