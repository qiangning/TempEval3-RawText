Flour, beans and vegetable oil from the UN World Food Programme were handed out for the first time Saturday to over 20 institutions caring for hungry Albanians across the lawless republic.

Trucks and vans from hospitals, orphanages and homes for the handicapped drove to Albania's main port from around the country to collect their quota.

However, they will make the journey back to their institutions without escorts from the eight-nation protection force which is currently being deployed in Albania.

The UN agency has stockpiled more than 400 tonnes of wheat flour, beans and vegetable oil in warehouses at the delapidated port, enough to feed 7,500 people for three months.

Europe's poorest state has been gripped by unrest and banditry for over a month following street protests over the collapse of bogus investment schemes snowballed into armed insurrection.

The aid is part of a package of measures aimed at restoring stablity to the country which must prepare for elections at the end of June. The protection force is in Albania to help safeguard the aid. French troops have secured Durres port and are guarding the WFP shipment.

WFP's Laura Boldini said: "This is not an operation where you could have a military escort. It's to meet the needs of the institutions which are without food. It's a low profile operation."
