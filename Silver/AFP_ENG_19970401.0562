Cambodian dissident Sam Rainsy said at the funerals of five victims of the weekend grenade attack on an anti-government demonstration that he was "terribly sad" but would not give up his political crusade.

Funerals for five of the 16 people killed in Sunday's grenade attack outside parliament were held in the Wat Langka temple in Phnom Penh.

The families of the five men wept and prayed as the victims were cremated in traditional Buddhist ceremonies. "Give back my husband," screamed Bout Varun, widow of Chhet Duong Daravudh, a journalist and member of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP).

Several grenades were thrown into a crowd of about 200 demonstrators across from Cambodia's parliament.

Sam Rainsy, the president of the KNP who organized the protest against judicial corruption, told mourners he "was shocked and terribly sad" but not "discouraged."

"I swear that we will continue until the final victory," he said. "One day in the not too distant future we will see justice prevail in Cambodia.

"Many people have died for this cause but many others are prepared to sacrifice their lives until justice is done," Sam Rainsy said as the body of Han Mony, the bodyguard who he credits with saving his life was placed on the bier.

Sam Rainsy has blamed Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and his formerly communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP) for the attack which also left at least 119 people wounded. The CPP has denied involvement in the attack.

But Sam Rainsy continued his allegations against the second prime minister who on Wednesday began celebrations for his 47th birthday on Friday.

"Today we pray for those who lost their lives, we pray also for those who are still alive including the leaders of Cambodia, all the leaders.

He said of Hun Sen: "I pray that god forgives him. I pray that god inspires Hun Sen to stop causing violence that mades innocent people suffer."

Because cremating a body takes several hours and Wat Langka has only one crematorium, the ceremony was expected to last throughout Wednesday.

About 200 people, including two representatives of King Norodom Sihanouk, several MPs from the royalist FUNCINPEC party and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, the ambassadors of Australia, Canada and Japan and the charge d'affaires of the US embassy attended.

Two other victims of the attack were cremated on Monday at the temple. The other victims were expected to be cremated in private family ceremonies.
