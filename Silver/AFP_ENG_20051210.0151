Jamie Dwyer scored two goals as Olympic gold medallists Australia opened their Champions Trophy campaign with a fluent 4-1 win over revamped Germany here on Saturday.

Dwyer, whose sudden-death goal against the Netherlands in Athens last year gave Australia their first Olympic title, began the gold rush by flicking in a pass from the right in the 15th minute.

Nathan Eglington broke through the middle in the 31st minute and scooped past German goalkeeper Ulrich Bubolz to help Australia go into half-time 2-0 ahead.

Dwyer, the International Hockey Federation's reigning player of the year, made it 3-0 two minutes after the resumption when he deflected in a penalty corner hit by Luke Doerner.

World Cup champions Germany, who are rebuilding after eight top players retired at the end of the Athens Olympics, could not contain the rampaging Aussies.

Australia earned a penalty stroke in the 40th minute when Dwyer was stick-checked inside the circle and Brent Livermore coolly pushed home to make it 4-0.

The young Germans were rewarded for a late assault on the Australian defence when Christopher Zeller scored a consolation goal for his side.

"It's nice to return to the Champions Trophy with a win," said Australian coach Barry Dancer, whose side missed last year's event in Lahore, Pakistan due to security concerns.

"This is just the start we needed because every point earned will count in the tournament," Dancer said.

"As Olympic champions we are one of the favoured sides to win the title and we are focused on that goal."

German coach Bernhard Peters conceded the Aussies were too good.

"Ours is a young team without much experience in world hockey so this was a good learning experience for all," he said. "What we have learned here will help us in the remaining games."

Defending champions Spain take on hosts India and the Netherlands clash with Pakistan in the remaining matches of the opening day in the elite six-nation event.
