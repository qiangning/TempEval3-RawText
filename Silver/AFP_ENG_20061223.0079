Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas has indefinitely postponed a visit to Jordan that had been scheduled for Sunday, Palestinian ambassador Atallah Khairy told AFP.

"President Abbas is determined to attend the Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem in accordance with the tradition set by the late Yasser Arafat," Khairy said Saturday.

Abbas's spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina told reporters in Ramallah that the Palestinian president planned to travel to Jordan on Monday.

Abbas had been due to hold talks with King Abdullah II after deadly clashes in the Gaza Strip between his secular Fatah faction and the ruling Islamist movement Hamas following his call last weekend for early elections.

Abdullah hosted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert during the latter's surprise visit to Jordan last week.
