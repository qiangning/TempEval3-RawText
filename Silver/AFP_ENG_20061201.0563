The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said Friday it has agreed to pay 60 million dollars to settle accusations by 45 people that they were sexually abused by priests.

"Today's settlement of 45 cases is a positive step forward in the church's efforts to promote healing and reconciliation for those who have suffered abuse by members of the clergy," said Cardinal Roger Mahony, head of the archdiocese.

The Roman Catholic Church in the United States has been rocked by clergy pedophilia scandals in recent years. Several priests have been convicted and at least two dioceses have gone bankrupt after being sentenced to pay huge civil penalties and interest.

The 45 alleged victims in the Los Angeles case represent only a tenth of those who have initiated a legal procedure against the archdiocese.

The archdiocese has said its financial stability would not be compromised by the settlement because it had made budgetary adjustments since last year.
