Allan Wagner, secretary general of the Andean Community of Nations (CAN), called for unity among Latin American nations on Tuesday.

He said the unity among Latin American nations, a legacy left by South America's liberator Simon Bolivar, is a "great challenge" for the regional bloc.

"The great challenge for our nations is to obey Simon Bolivar's instruction to maintain the unity of Latin American people: nearly two centuries after he left it as a legacy," he said.

Wagner made the remarks in response to the statements made by Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez during his weekend radio and television show on Sunday. Chavez said his country had more in common with the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) than the Andean Community, where Venezuela is a full member.

Mercosur, in which Venezuela is an associate member, is made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Headquartered in Lima, the Andean Community groups Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Chile, which helped found the organization in 1969, quit in 1976.

Latin American countries are confronting a grave dilemma over how to solve the deep socio-economic divide, Wagner noted.

"This represents a serious situation: poverty, exclusion and inequality, far from improving, have worsened," the secretary general added.

Wagner said he is in favor of a new kind of international relations that will respond to development targets with "social equality."

"We should all be united in this task, because it is an enormous challenge," he said.

Wagner added that it is necessary to deepen the integration of the Andean countries with Mercosur and Chile to promote the development of the South American Community of Nations (CSN).

"We will all meet in the CSN and there we will grow in strength so that we can reach the targets, in terms of development and well-being, that our people are crying out for."

The CSN, established on Dec. 8, 2004, in the Peruvian city of Cuzco, groups Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Guyana, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela.

Its establishment was considered as an important step toward South American integration.
