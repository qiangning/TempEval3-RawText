The United States has demanded interim custody of a US marine sentenced to 40 years in jail for raping a Filipina woman, the Philippines foreign department said Wednesday.

The US embassy in Manila filed a diplomatic note invoking the right of the US military authorities to exercise custody of the marine in keeping with the provisions of the Visiting Forces Agreement between the two countries.
