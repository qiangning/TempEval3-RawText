Indonesia's main opposition party has complained about unfair media coverage just two days into the official campaigning period, claiming that a state-owned television station was biased.

The Moslem-led United Development Party (PPP) has strongly protested "the discriminatory attitude" of the state-owned television channel Televisi Republik Indonesia (TVRI) in reporting the campaign, which started Sunday.

In a press statement received here late Sunday, PPP Secretary General Tosari Wijaya protested the fact that TVRI did not report his party's successful campaign in North Sumatra while other private television channels did.

The Media Indonesia daily Monday also reported that in Solo, Central Java, a local journalist was mobbed by supporters of the ruling Golkar party after he failed to display the party's finger sign. His motorcycle was damaged in the encounter, the daily said.

Indonesia on Monday entered the second day of its 27-day election campaign with the country's three government-recognised political parties drumming up support in separate islands.

Golkar members are scheduled to address rallies on Sumatra and Bali island, the Lesser Sunda islands and in East Timor, a party schedule show.

Golkar Chairman Harmoko, who is also information minister, is scheduled to address a rally in Aceh and North Sumatra while several other cabinet ministers are also on the list of party speakers for the day.

Executives of the PPP, without party chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum who will rest for the day after campaigning in North Sumatra Sunday, will address the population in Sulawesi and Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo island.

The third and last state-recognized party, the rift-plagued Indonesian Democracy Party (PDI), is due to campaign in Java, the Moluccas and Irian Jaya, the election campaign rooster show.

The party's campaign will not involve popular former PDI chairwoman Megawati Sukarnoputri which was deposed in mid-term by a state-backed rebel congress in June and replaced by Suryadi.

The PDI headquarters here could not say where chairman Suryadi would campaign in Java on Monday or what the plan was for the capital.

Suryadi has remained unpopular among the PDI masses and has faced frequent opposition rallies during his visits to PDI branches nationwide, especially in Java.

Megawati, daughter of founding president Sukarno, said this week that she would not take part in the election campaign but urged supporters to monitor the elections closely.

Indonesia's 124 million eligible voters will elect candidates to 425 seats in parliament in the May 29 polls, choosing from among the country's three official political parties -- Golkar, PPP and PDI. Campaigning ends on May 23.

Suharto's Golkar has had landslide victories in the past five elections since 1971, and is expected to do the same this year. Golkar has been repeatedly criticized for using government facilities and officials to gain support in the elections.
