Iraqi helicopters started on Friday to fly home Moslem pilgrims from the Saudi border, violating US-patrolled exclusion zones in the south and north of the country, the official news agency INA said.

A first helicopter carrying "sick, elderly or weary" pilgrims took off from the southern border region of Jodaidat Arar to the town of Mosul in northern Iraq, it said, without giving the number of passengers.

"The operation to transport pilgrims to other governorates will continue," the agency added. A second group of returning pilgrims was expected at Jodaidat Arar, three kilometres (two miles) from the border, on Saturday.

Official Baghdad Radio and Youth TV, which is run by President Saddam Hussein's son Uday, interrupted its programmes to announce the news of the first flight and played patriotic songs.

Baghdad earlier this week sent nine helicopters to the south, already violating the "no-fly" zone, to wait for the Iraqis returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.

The flight to Mosul also violates a northern exclusion zone set up shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Iraqi Kurds from air attack by Baghdad.

Iraq said the helicopters were sent to ferry home dozens of elderly and sick pilgrims, in defiance of Washington which imposed the exclusion zone in the south together with London and Paris since 1992.

The United States said the southern flights were a "technical" violation and that it would not take military action in retaliation.

But the US Defense Department on Thursday accused Baghdad of seeking to exploit the annual pilgrimage to Islam's holiest sites, known as the hajj, for political ends.

"I think they're trying to hide behind religion or to manipulate the hajj pilgrimage for political reasons," said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. "We're not going to play that game.

"We've stressed we're not going to interfere with their efforts to bring pilgrims back from the hajj," he said.

"And we've also made it very clear that we continue to enforce the no- fly, no-drive zone which is designed to prevent the Iraqis from accumulating military power in the southern part of their country."

Baghdad, which in September said it would no longer recognize no-fly zones set up in the south to protect Shiite Moslems and the north for the Kurds, has hailed the flights as a victory.

"Iraq has for years rejected these imaginary lines and announced in its official communiques that it does not recognize the zones because they are not in UN Security Council resolutions," an official spokesman told AFP on Friday.

On April 9, Iraq also flouted the UN sanctions in force since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait and flew more than 100 Iraqis to Saudi Arabia for the start of the pilgrimage.

Iraq insisted that the flight was "purely humanitarian" and so not a violation of the embargo, a position which China, Egypt, France and Russia supported in the UN Security Council.

The United States failed in its efforts to secure UN condemnation of Iraq for the flight to Saudi Arabia.
