Nigerian vice president Atiku Abubakar's new party, the Action Congress (AC), Sunday slammed President Olusegun Obasanjo's declaration that his former deputy's office was now vacant as "unconstititional".

Obasanjo on Saturday declared vacant the office of his embattled deputy after he defected to the rival opposition AC party ahead of the April 2007 elections.

Presidential spokesman Uba Sani told reporters in Abuja Saturday that the decision had been taken in response to Abubakar's defection early last week.

The vice president was expelled from the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday after he defected to the AC and was chosen as its presidential candidate for the 2007 elections.

In its reaction on Sunday, the AC described as "unconstitutional, null and void" the declaration that Abubakar's seat had become vacant because he dumped the ruling party.

"Just when we thought this lawless party and its visionless leaders have reached rock bottom in their acts of brigandage, they over-reached themselves by perpetrating the mother of all illegalities," it said in a statement.

Saturday, Abubakar said that he would challenge "this illegality in a competent court of law and I have also begun wide consultation with stakeholders in the nation to halt this sad and regrettable slide to tyranny and lawlessness".

However, the PDP had earlier cited constitutional rules stating that the vice-president must belong to the same party as the president.

The PDP had already suspended Abubakar last September after he was indicted on corruption charges by the country's anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.

Major local newspapers on Sunday, reported on their front pages, Abubakar's sacking and the alleged invasion of his home by security agents who carted away his official cars.

The Sunday Punch newspaper also reported that Abubakar, currently on a two-week vacation in the United States, might be arrested on his return to face corruption charges.
