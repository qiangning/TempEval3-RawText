South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki- moon will hold one-on-one talks with his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso on the sidelines of the upcoming Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, reported South Korean Yonhap News Agency on Wednesday.

Yonhap quoted a source from the government as saying that Ban and Taro agreed to meet during a telephone conversation earlier in the day.

But the exact date of the meeting has not been fixed. The APEC summit meetings are to take place in the third week of this month in South Korea's southern port city of Busan.

"They will exchange views on bilateral ties including ways of addressing the current strained relations," the unnamed official was quoted by Yonhap as saying.

The two neighbors' relations have been strained since Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited Yasukuni Shrine, which honors 2 million Japanese war dead, including 14 Class A Criminals of the World War II.

The South Korean government, political parties and non- governmental groups have made strong reactions to the latest shrine visit, the fifth since Koizumi took office in 2001.

The ties between South Korea and Japan did not turn better although Ban made a trip to Japan last week.

Public anger in South Korea even deepened as Koizumi brought in some hawkish officials, including Shinzo Abe as chief Cabinet secretary and Taro Aso as foreign minister, in his latest cabinet reshuffle on Monday.

It is still unclear whether South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun will hold a summit with Koizumi during the APEC event, the official said.
