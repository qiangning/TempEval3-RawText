Bulgarian lawmakers on Tuesday approved the new constitutional amendments needed to raise accountability in the judiciary ahead of European Union membership on Jan. 1 next year.

The state-owned BTA reported that in a vote at the National Assembly, the parliament, 203 of 240 deputies backed amendments to end blanket immunity held by judges, prosecutors and investigators and to set up a special parliament-elected inspectorate to monitor the judiciary.

This is the fourth amendment to the 1991 constitution and also the second amendment in 2006.

Changes in the country's basic law are regarded as important steps for Bulgaria's bid for EU membership.
