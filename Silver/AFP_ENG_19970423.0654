Peru's president Wednesday surveyed the aftermath of the spectacular raid on the Japanese ambassador's residence, visiting the wounded hostages and inspecting the grisly scene at the mansion.

Fujimori was showered with international praise following Tuesday's bold daylight raid to free the 72 hostages from their four-month ordeal.

And he was certain to receive more congratulations from Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, who was expected in Lima early Thursday accompanied by the relatives of several former hostages.

The Peruvian leader visited the military hospital to chat with some of the 25 former hostages wounded in the raid, including Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela.

Tudela underwent surgery for a bullet wound to the leg he sustained during the 40-minute operation, according to Fujimori. Two soldiers, one hostage and all 14 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) hostage-takers were killed in the raid.

As Fujimori surveyed the scene, the remains of the rebels lay in plastic body bags on the lawn of the residence they had seized December 17. Three of the bodies were mutilated beyond recognition, local television reported.

Gaping holes in the residence, shattered windows and splintered doors bore mute testimony to Tuesday's attack.

Details of the operation that emerged Wednesday showed elite troops secretly dug a network of tunnels and used coded messages as well as the element of surprise.

Fujimori said it took between 35 and 50 days to build the tunnels under the compound.

He also confirmed that the hostages had "a few minutes" warning of the attack but declined to say how the message had been passed.

A former agent of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation said security forces tipped off the hostages about the imminent raid by speaking to a captive who was retired officer via a concealed two-way radio.

"We will free you in three minutes," was the message sent to the hostage, Bob Taubert told CNN television.

The raid started just after 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) Tuesday, with heavily armed soldiers simultaneously emerging from the tunnels, through the main door and through a back entrance.

One group of soldiers blasted a hole in the ceiling, through which the hostages were freed.

All the hostages were on the second floor of the residence when the attack was launched, while most of the rebels were on the first floor playing indoor soccer.

An explosion underneath the living room killed five or six of the rebels immediately, while another group ran to the second floor, Fujimori said.

There, some of the rebels, including leader Nestor Cerpa, fired back at the troops, killing one soldier. Cerpa and his comrades were then gunned down by the soldiers.

The mediating team that sought to broker a peaceful end to the standoff was given no prior warning, Roman Catholic Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani told reporters.

Cipriani, along with Michel Minnig of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent and Japanese envoy Terusuke Terada, told reporters they had not expected the assault.

Cipriani wept as he read a joint statement in which the mediators said they "share the pain of those who lost a life from their family and we share the joy" of those who were reunited.

Friends, relatives and fellow hostages gathered Wednesday to mourn Supreme Court Justice Carlos Guisti, who died of a heart attack after he was shot.

World leaders applauded the end to the standoff, which Fujimori said showed Peru would "never cave in" to terrorism.

But the key praise came from Japan -- Peru's biggest single source of foreign aid -- which hailed the operation.

Twenty-four Japanese nationals, including Ambassador Morihisa Aoki, were among the captives.

Fujimori was cautious not to appear overly confident. Asked if the raid wiped out the MRTA, he pointed out that rebel leader Hugo Avellaneda Valdez was still at large, presumably in Peru's central jungle.

Fujimori's administration was widely criticized for declaring the fight against guerrillas was all but over just months before the siege at the Japanese ambassador's residence.

Tupac Amaru guerrillas elsewhere vowed to continue the fight of their comrades.

The deadly end to the hostage crisis only served to reaffirm the group's "decision to continue fighting for a society with peace and social justice," according to a statement posted in Spanish on the rebel group's website.
