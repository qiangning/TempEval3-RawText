The United Nations on Monday underscored the importance of rainwater in revitalizing agricultural production in developing countries.

In a report released at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Agroforestry Center said rainwater harvesting as a buffer against climate-linked extreme weather has been almost invisible in water planning with countries relying almost exclusively on rivers and underground supplies.

The report said rainwater harvesting also held important potential to assist managers of protected areas with the technologies that had been tested to help wild animals in places like Nairobi and Tsavo National Parks in Kenya during drought.

The study said many communities and countries suffering or facing water shortages as a result of climate change could dramatically boost supplies by collecting and storing rain falling freely from clouds. Kenya, which has a population of over 30 million, has enough rainfall to supply the needs of its current population for six to seven times, said the report.

"Ethiopia, where just over a fifth of the population are covered by domestic water supply and an estimated 46 percent of the population suffer hunger, has a potential rainwater harvest equivalent to the population needs of over 520 million people," it said.

The UNEP and the World Agroforestry Center urged the governments and donors to invest more widely in low-cost technologies to deploy and maintain rainwater in Africa.

"Unlike big dams which collect and store water over large areas, small-scale rainwater harvesting projects lose less water to evaporation because rain is collected locally and can be stored in a variety of ways," the report said.

The report's overall conclusion is that Africa does not lack water. Rainfall contribution, it said, is more than adequate to meet the needs of current population for several times.

"In the popular mind, Africa is seen as a dry continent. But overall, it actually has more water resources per capita than Europe. However, much of Africa's rain comes in burst and is rapidly swept away or is never collected," Dennis Garrity, director general of the World Agroforestry Center, said.

Currently, 14 out of Africa's 53 countries are categorized as water-stressed or water-scarce.

A water-stressed country has water availability of less than 1, 700 cubic meters per capita every year and a water scarce one less than 1,000 cubic meters.

It is estimated that the number of countries in Africa in this situation could double by 2025 to be about half of all.
