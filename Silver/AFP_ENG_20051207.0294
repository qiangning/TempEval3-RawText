The coaches of the 32 nations that have qualified for the 2006 World Cup will all be at Friday's draw with the sole exception of Argentina manager Jose Pekerman.

England's Sven-Goran Eriksson, Australia's Guus Hiddink, Japan manager Zico and other leading coaches will all witness the draw live, Wolfgang Niersbach, vice-president of the organising committee, revealed at a press conference.

"All the managers will be in Leipzig expect for Pekerman," said Niersbach.

"The Argentina Football Federation did not give a reason for his absence."   Argentina are one of the eight seeds for Friday's draw.
