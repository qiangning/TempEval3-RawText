Thousands of mourners marched on Tuesday behind the coffin of a young Shiite Muslim killed during mass opposition rallies, chanting for the fall of the Lebanese government.

"Death to (Prime Minister Fuad) Siniora," chanted the crowd, marching on a main road leading to the Rawdat Ash-Shahidain (maryrs') cemetery in Beirut's Shiite southern suburbs.

Ahmad Mahmud, 20, was killed during street fights which erupted on Sunday in several Sunni Muslim-majority neighbourhoods near where the opposition has been holding mass protests since Friday to demand the government's resignation.

"The blood of the Shiites is boiling," shouted other angry mourners, raising the green flags of the Shiite movement Amal.

The incidents have prompted officials to call for calm amid fears of a descent into sectarian violence in a country still reeling from the 1975-1990 civil war.

At the funeral ceremony, Sheikh Abdel Amir Qabalan, interim president of the Higher Shiite Council, appealed for calm and unity amid the deep political division in the country.

"We present the martyr as a sacrifice for Lebanon's national unity," he said.

"It is forbidden for Shiites to kill Sunnis, for Sunnis to kill Shiites, for Christians to kill Muslims and vice-versa," said Qabalan.
