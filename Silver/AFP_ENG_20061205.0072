The Hong Kong government was forced to back down Tuesday on the introduction of a sales tax after it failed to win enough public support for a change in the city's famously low tax environment.

Financial Secretary Henry Tang said the decision was reached after an ongoing public consultation showed that the controversial plan, which has been widely criticised on all sides, lacked public support.

"It is clear from the views collected that we have not been able to convince the majority to accept GST (Goods and Sales Tax) as the main option to address the (narrow) tax base problem," Tang said in a surprise announcement.

"So we accepted that at this time we do not have the public support nor the conditions for introducing a GST. For the remainder of the consultation (period), we will not be advocating GST as the only option" on tax changes.

Tang did not take questions nor clarify whether the government would re-visit the issue in the future but he called on people to continue to make their views known on other possible ways to widen the tax base.

Hong Kong currently levies a 16 percent personal tax rate with companies paying just 17.5 percent, making it one of the lowest tax regimes anywhere -- a point the government itself promotes in its efforts to attract businesses here.

Officials said a GST was needed to pay for an ageing population and to provide a more stable revenue base for the city, which depends too much on volatile income streams including land sales and investment returns.

Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang said he and the Executive Council, or cabinet, completely supported the decision.

"We believe that the decision (Tang) has made respects fully the wishes of Hong Kong people that we should seriously consider widening our tax base."

The government hoped the GST would bring in some 30 billion dollars (3.8 billion US) a year in extra revenue, claiming that by 2033, more than a quarter of the population would be retired and need more public services.

The public almost unanimously denounced the plan from the start of the consultation period in July and all the major political parties opposed it too, making it unlikely to have got through the legislature.

Activists accused Tang of robbing the poor to pay the rich while business interests said a sales tax would decimate the booming tourism industry by making shopping in Hong Kong -- one of its biggest draws -- less attractive.

Analysts said that against this backdrop, Tuesday's move may have been politically motivated, coming just before Sunday's naming of an 800-member election committee to choose Hong Kong's next leader, widely expected to the Tsang.

"This is obviously linked to (Tsang's) re-election. He knew that it would be bad if he had so many problems to solve before he even started lobbying for support," said James Sung, political scientist at City University.

"He knew the GST would be the biggest problem to tackle and since he knew it would fail sooner or later, he'd rather end it quickly," Sung said.

Paul Chan, president of the Hong Kong Institute of Public Accountants which supports a GST, urged the government to continue to seek alternatives to widen the tax base.

"There's uncertainty here and something needs to be done. The government should consider what would be the second best (solution) and it shouldn't give it up," he added.
