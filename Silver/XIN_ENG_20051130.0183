Dozens of Palestinians demonstrated on Wednesday in front of headquarters of the International Committee for Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza to express solidarity with Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention camp of Ofer.

"We demonstrated today to support all the prisoners jailed in Israeli detentions and stop practices against prisoners," Hisham Abdel Razeq, chief of prisoners affairs of the Palestinian National Authority, said.

Meanwhile, the Prisoners' Committee for National and Islamic Powers said in a statement that the committee condemned Israeli assaults and called on the international committee to press Israel to stop its practices against prisoners.

It was reported that Israeli guards in Ofer prison attacked Palestinian prisoners on Monday and Tuesday, firing tear gas and beating them by club and wounding some 20 prisoners.
