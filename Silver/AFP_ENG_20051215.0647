EU leaders agreed Thursday on the urgent need for a budget deal, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said after a first day of negotiations on the issue dividing the bloc.

"We're talking about money, we're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation," Blair said after chairing a first round of talks at a two-day summit.

"I think that everybody realises that if we are going to do a deal on the budget, it's now," he added.

Wrangling over the EU's budget broke off late Thursday with European leaders eagerly awaiting fresh proposals from the EU's British presidency to break the gridlock.

Blair indicated that Britain would present a set of fresh proposals, so long as there was a point in doing so.

"Obviously we have anticipated doing that and said to people that we will, but there's got to be a basis for agreement otherwise there's no point in putting forward proposals."

Leaders had what some have called a "blunt" discussions over Britain's existing proposals on Thursday, even though they did not get into nitty-gritty haggling over concrete figures.

A British source said: "It was a pretty tough discussion. The good thing is that people want to do a deal at this summit," said a British source, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Blair is under particularly fierce pressure to come up with new proposals that would cut down Britain's jealously guarded annual rebate budget contributions.

But the British leaders is refusing to give ground without guarantees notably on reforms to the EU's long-disputed farm subsidy system, of which France is the main beneficiary.

"It's looking difficult but not impossible," said the British source, adding: "There isn't an awful lot of room to play with."
