Japan's Hitachi Ltd. has won a 16 billion yen (126.5 million dollar) order from a Chinese company to supply a rolling mill near Shanghai, a company spokesman said Tuesday.

Hitachi got the order from Baoshan Iron Corp. jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Marubeni Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp.

The mill aims to meet rising demand for cold rolled sheet steel in China for use in consumer electronics, automobiles and other products, the spokesman said.

Financing for the mill will be managed by the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
