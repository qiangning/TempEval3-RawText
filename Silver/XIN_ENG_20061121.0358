Two Italians working for International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were released unharmed on Tuesday midnight shortly after their kidnapping in Gaza earlier in the day, Palestinian security officials said.

The officials said that the kidnappers had run away after they dropped the two hostages, a male and a female, near a police station in central Gaza Strip.

"Then the two walked towards the police station," they said, adding that security members who arrived the scene shortly after receiving the report from the police station have taken the two to a hotel in Gaza.

However, the kidnappers' identity is still unknown as no one had claimed responsibility for the abduction, said the officials.

For fear of more such abduction of its members, the local Red Cross office announced to suspend its activities in the area shortly before their release.

The two Italians were abducted by unknown militants in an area between the towns of Khan Younis and Deir el-Ballah in the afternoon.

The kidnapping was the latest in a spate of abductions of foreigners and journalists in Gaza in recent months.

In October, two Spanish citizens, one was the photographer of the Associated Press and the other works for a humanitarian organization, were also abducted. They were freed shortly after the abduction.
