Runners and spectators at this weekend's London marathon were warned Saturday by police to be vigilant against terrorist attack.

Up to 27,000 runners are expected to take part in Sunday's race around London, with a crowd of 500,000 lining streets to cheer them on.

The warning comes in the wake of last weekend's alert when the Grand National horse race had to be postponed and a 70,000 crowd cleared from the course at Aintree in northwest England after hoax bomb warnings by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).

A terrorist expert said it was clear the IRA had embarked on a policy of causing maximum disruption and intimidation on the British mainland in the run-up to the general election on May 1.

But neither Scotland Yard nor the organisers of Sunday's race would comment on whether security had been increased to take into account the IRA's apparent switch to targeting sporting events.

A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said: "We always ask people to be vigilant. If they see anything suspicious they should report it."

Professor Paul Wilkinson, a terrorist expert in the International Relations department at Saint Andrew's University in Scotland, said: "It would be wrong to assume that the IRA has switched tactics. We cannot discount any target."
