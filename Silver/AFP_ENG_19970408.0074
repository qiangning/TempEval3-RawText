In a rare meeting between one of the driving forces of the capitalist world and one of Asia's main communist leaders, US Secretary Treasury Robert Rubin held talks Tuesday with Vietnamese communist party chief Do Muoi.

The 55-minute meeting was described by Rubin as "very focused on the economic development in Vietnam."

Muoi "stressed the 4,000 year history of the country and the fact that much of it has been a troubled history and a proud history. What he would really like to see now is for Vietnam to grow economically," Rubin told reporters after the meeting.

Rubin, who is the first US treasury secretary to ever visit Vietnam, said the meeting was similar to Monday's talks with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in Hanoi when they discussed moving ahead on full economic normalisation and impediments faced by US businesses in Vietnam.

Rubin said Muoi told him he "hoped we could move on the various aspects of economic normalisation at a good pace."

But the communist leader also said "he understood that each of these things involves complications."

Rubin said there was clearly warm feelings between Vietnam and the United States.

"He said he had the impression that there is a lot of goodwill towards Vietnam in the congress and the United States, though there were some people that were more reluctant," Rubin said.

The US Congress is expected to ratify the nomination of the first US ambassador to Hanoi, Douglas Peterson later this week.

Rubin added that he had raised impediments faced by American businesses in Vietnam. "He said has discussed those with the prime minister and he is trying to work on those, but this country has done a lot in a short time and things take time.

"I told him things take a lot of time in our country too," Rubin said.

Rubin said his talk with Muoi touched briefly on politics, while Muoi had stressed his focus on education.

"We had a brief conversation about democracy. He greatly valued our values and our democratic position," Rubin said.

Rubin said he told Muoi he had been enormously impressed with the Vietnamese people, as hardworking and energetic.

During his two and a half day visit in Vietnam Rubin has stressed the importance of Vietnam improving its climate for foreign businesses.

"Many companies have found lots of difficulties, and that has slowed foreign investment flows," Rubin told a group of Vietnamese students at the Harvard-funded Fullbright Centre.

"It seems like there are excessive licencing requirements, bureaucratic difficulties, the absence of a clear legal framework and the difficulty of enforcing contracts," hesaid.

Negotiators from the two countries will sit down next week to work on a draft trade agreement that will eventually pave the way for Vietnam to receive most favoured nation status with the US.

Both sides recognise however that there is still a long way to go.

According to one official familiar with talks, the trickiest issue will be the US insistence of national treatment for its companies.

"Maybe the sound of it bothers them. The idea of treating US companies like Vietnamese companies is really tough for them," the official said in Hanoi on Monday.

Rubin met with Muoi in the Independence Palace, the former presidential palace of the Saigon regime, a sprawling building in central Ho Chi Minh City.

In the grounds sits a north Vietnamese tank which crashed through its gates on April 30, 1975, symbolizing the end of the Vietnam war.

Earlier in the day Rubin visited a primary school where the World Bank is funding new classrooms and materials.

Rubin was to meet with the chief of the Ho Chi Minh City Communist Party and acting mayor Truong Tan Sang for a courtesy call before flying back to Washington on a US Airforce jet.
