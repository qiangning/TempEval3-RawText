The "Central Election Commission" of the Taiwan authorities on Tuesday announced a candidate list for the island's election of county heads, county councilors and village heads.

It is the first time for the island to put the election of county heads, county councilors and village heads in one election.

The election will be held in December.

The so called "three-in-one" election aims to economize election costs, according to the Taiwan authorities.

Statistics offered by the "Central Election Commission" showed that the Taiwan authorities spent more than 13.1 billion New Taiwan dollars (409 million US dollars) holding a total of 21 elections over the past ten years.

Although three elections integrated in one, the island's election atmosphere is still crazy. News of the election, candidate introductions and election analysis are frequently seen on local newspapers and TV programs. Candidates' photos and posters with their competition slogans were put up along the streets.

There are also reports of corruption. At present, 12 candidates are sued for being suspected of taking bribes for more votes.
