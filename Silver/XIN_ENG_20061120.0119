Australian authorities have deported more than 2,000 Indonesian fishermen for illegal trespassing till November this year, an Indonesian official said Monday.

The fishermen were flown back to East Nusa Tenggara province after undergoing legal proceedings in Australia on charges of illegal fishing and border crossing, said Frans Salem, head of the provincial office for social affairs in East Nusa Tenggara.

"This figure is fantastic compared with the previous years," he was quoted by the national Antara news agency as saying.

The fishermen mostly came from the eastern parts of Indonesia, including East Nusa Tenggara, Papua, Sulawesi and Maluku, he said.

"Our fishermen use compass to navigate their vessels, but they have little knowledge about Indonesia-Australia marine borders and can be easily seized by the patrols of the Australian Navy," he said.
