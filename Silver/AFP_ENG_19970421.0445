World Trade Organisation (WTO) chief Renato Ruggiero called here Monday for a new "sense of urgency" on the issue of China's entry to the global trade body, amid signs of real progress towards a final agreement.

During a meeting with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, which was held in an "extremely positive atmosphere," Ruggiero stressed that both sides must take advantage of breakthroughs made during March talks on China's WTO accession in Geneva.

"March has been a success, but now we have to build on the momentum with a sense of urgency in order to accelerate negotiations," the WTO director general said.

The breakthroughs in the March talks were China's undertaking to grant individual overseas firms import-export rights three years after joining the WTO, and its pledge to abide by all WTO rules on intellectual property rights from the moment of its accession.

However, according to WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, Ruggiero also stressed the need for greater flexibilty from China over issues such as market access, especially in the services and agricultural sectors.

"The director general said that movement on market access was something the other WTO members would really insist on," Rockwell said.

According to sources close to Monday's talks, Wu Yi accepted the need for greater flexibility, but insisted that the WTO members take into account China's current level of economic development.

The next round of Geneva talks will be held in May, when hot topics will include non-discrimination against foreign firms, transparency and price controls.

Despite the difficulties presented by these issues, Rockwell said the current atmosphere was overwhelmingly optimistic.

"There is now acknowledgement from all parties that an agreement can be made," he said.

It now appears clear that the WTO is willing to grant China a transition period -- but only in certain sectors -- to come into line with particular WTO requirements.

"The question now is how long a transition period and in which sectors," Rockwell said.

In a speech at Beijing University earlier Monday, Ruggiero admitted that even with the exisiting positive feeling, tough negotiations remained ahead.

"Much of the important work -- and the toughest issues -- have been left to the end," he said, while warning Beijing that WTO membership was crucial to the country's economic future.

"An outward-looking China cannot afford to stand on the sidelines while others write the rules of the game," he said.

"China's entry into the global trading system is about more than trade, it is about China's future role as a world economic leader."

China tried in vain to be a founding member of the WTO in 1995. Before that, it had been seeking admission to the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1986.

"We want China to be a WTO member, but only under the right terms and conditions," Rockwell said, adding that with 27 other nations waiting for admission, China could not be allowed to set any precedents.

"If the rules are altered to suit one entrant, other countries will obviously want the same."

Following his talks with Wu Yi, Ruggiero also met with Vice Premier Li Lanqing. He is scheduled to hold talks with Premier Li Peng on Tuesday, before leaving Beijing on Wednesday.
