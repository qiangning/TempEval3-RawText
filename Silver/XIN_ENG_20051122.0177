Kenya's proposed new constitution has been rejected in Monday's referendum, Chairman of the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) Samuel Kivuitu announced on Tuesday.

The latest results given by the ECK show that opponents of the proposed charter had won 3,548,477 votes, or 57 percent of ballots that had been counted by Tuesday afternoon, gaining an unassailable lead of more than a million votes. Supporters garnered 2,532,918 votes, or 43 percent.

Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki Tuesday in a televised speech conceded defeat in the referendum on the draft constitution which was soundly rejected by his people.
