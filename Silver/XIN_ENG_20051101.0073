The newly-appointed Chief of Defense Forces of Uganda has warned retired officers against sowing seeds of divisionism in the army.

General Aronda Nyakairima was quoted by local press on Tuesday as saying that there are some retired army officers who have turned against the Commander in Chief of the Ugandan armed Forces, President Yoweri Museveni and were trying to spread propaganda to disunite the army.

"Some officers, when they retire, turn against the commander in chief but we are in full force. Our response will be terrible for those trying to interfere with the army and dividing us. They stand warned. I am telling politicians that they should not attempt to sow seeds of disunity in the Uganda People's Defense Force (UPDF)," Nyakairima.

Two retired army officers, Col. Kiiza Besigye and Maj. Gen. Mugisha Muntu have been critical of President Museveni and the UPDF.

The two officers belong to one of the major opposition parties in Uganda, the Forum for Democratic Change.

"We have seen governments which have spent only one year, 68 days or even two months in power. The UPDF is determined to defend the country from such and also defend a government which is clearly steering the country into development and stability," said Nyakairima.

Nyakairima's statement comes after President Museveni promoted and retired some of the UPDF officers on October 24.

Uganda is currently going through a political transition period which will see it hold its first ever multiparty general elections in March next year after over 20 years of political parties being in abeyance.

In this transition period some politicians have been critical of the UPDF.
