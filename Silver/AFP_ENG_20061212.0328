Cheaper oil prices drove the US trade deficit down sharply to 58.9 billion dollars in October, from 64.3 billion dollars in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

The figure was a big surprise to analysts, who had expected the US shortfall in goods and services to come to 63 billion dollars in October.

The deficit fell to its lowest point since August 2005, and its monthly decline of 8.4 percent was the largest since December 2001.
