Colon, the Santa Fe team, beat soccer giant Boca Juniors, bringing the team's seven-match winning streak to an end, Argentine media reported on Sunday.

This weekend's results changed the leader board of Argentina's Apertura 2005 tournament dramatically: Boca now finds itself sharing the lead with Gymnasio and Esgrime La Plata, following wins by those two teams. All three have 28 points.

Spanish mid-fielder Ivan Moreno y Fabianesi, a Badajoz native, scored Colon's winning goal in the 82nd minute, beating a Boca Juniors team that had been weakened by a busy schedule of league, and Copa SudAmerica commitments.

Independiete and Velez Sarsfield share second place with 26 points, with five playing days to go in the competition.
