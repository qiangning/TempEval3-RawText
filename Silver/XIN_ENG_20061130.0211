The South Korean government announced on Thursday that it will pay all its late allotted charges to affiliated international agencies by next year, one year earlier than was originally planned.

South Korea plans to pay 116 million U.S. dollars that it owes in share expenses in agencies such as the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, by 2007, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said the South Korean government made the decision apparently for the upcoming inauguration of former South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon to the post of U.N. Secretary-general on Jan. 1 2007.
