The fate of an International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) official is now in the hands of those at the United Nations headquarters as his case was sent to New York already.

Local media quoted the Arusha-based UN court as saying that the report by a probe team on Roland Amoussouga having allegedly violated ICTR's conditions of appointment by assisting his friend to get a job in the UN court.

The probe team has been verifying the authenticity of recruitment electronic mails between the ICTR spokesperson and his French friend.

The registrar of the UN court, Adama Dieng, told the press that the report had been sent to New York.

The ICTR court, set up in 1994 in northern Tanzania that became operational in 1997, has its administrative matters taken care of in the UN headquarters.

The probe was prompted by leaked e-mail communication between Amoussouga and the candidate for a post of the head of the defense counsel management section.

The ICTR spokesperson not only allegedly tipped off the French lawyer about the qualifications needed for filling up the post and also allegedly informed his friend of the support to his candidature by other high-ranking officials at the tribunal.

The ICTR, whose mandate ends in 2008, has so far brought to trial 25 people while 26 others are currently on trial, with another 17 waiting to be taken to court.
