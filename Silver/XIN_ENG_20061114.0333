Czech Ambassador to Zimbabwe Vaclav Jilek said on Tuesday that he would meet Zimbabwe's tourism authorities to find ways of exploring untapped opportunities that exist between the two countries.

Jilek said he would help Zimbabwe's travel agencies build strong ties with their Czech counterparts, setting the stage for mutual cooperation.

He said Zimbabwe boasts a number of attractive sites such as the mighty Victoria Falls and the Great Zimbabwe, which had the potential to attract thousands of visitors from Czech every year. "The recently held International Travel Expo in Harare was an eye- opener and I have since been talking to different players on how best we can cooperate," he said.

Czechs, like their European counterparts in the United Kingdom and France, are high spenders and usually travel in small groups and stay longer, he said, but owing to poor marketing strategies, the country has continued to register low arrivals from the Eastern European country.

Zimbabwe has, since the land reform program in 2000, experienced a decline in tourist arrivals mainly from its traditional markets in Europe and America because of negative media coverage that portrayed the southern African country as an unsafe tourist destination.

This prompted the government to adopt a Look East policy, which has of late paid dividends while efforts are also underway to revive the traditional markets.

According to statistics from the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority ( ZTA), the country has already recorded an increase in arrivals in the first nine months this year, totaling 1.6 million, compared with about 1.5 million last year.
