Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Tuesday he wanted to see a speedy end to a conflict between Italian journalists and media bosses which has led to repeated strikes.

"I am happy that the strike is over because five days without newspapers is very worrying," Romano Prodi said. "I want you to find a rapid resolution to this disagreement," he told journalists according to the ANSA newsagency.

Newsstands were empty for five days when the written press went on strike on Thursday, Friday and Saturday before their two-day Christmas holiday.

Television and newspaper journalists have resorted to industrial action several times to demand the renewal of a collective bargaining charter nearly two years after it expired in 2005.

The journalists' representatives are demanding greater job security for journalists as well as legal recognition of freelancers, while the management stresses the need for flexibility and controlling costs.
