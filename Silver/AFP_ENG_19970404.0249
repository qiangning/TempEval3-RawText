New Zairean premier Etienne Tshisekedi fought to save his job Friday, rebuffed by rebels in the east and assailed by his political opponents at home just two days after taking up the post.

Opposition parties were expected to meet here Friday to discuss whether to replace him as prime minister, according to newspaper reports, after he angered just about everybody in sight in that short period.

With rebels advancing on two more key towns and peace talks due to start in South Africa at the weekend, this latest political crisis could not have come at a worse time for Zaire.

Tshisekedi, a long-time opponent of President Mobutu Sese Seko, made it clear in his first day in office Thursday that he would take up and finish his old political battles with the head of state.

He snubbed Mobutu by not giving a single job in his 24-member government to supporters of the president, and then compounded that by offering six to Laurent-Desire Kabila's rebels, including defence.

He praised the rebels for defending the national interest by fighting corruption, but dismissed the planned peace talks in South Africa between rebel and Mobutu officials this weekend as pointless.

Tshisekedi also dismissed the current transitional parliament, saying it should be replaced by a legislature conceived in 1992 but never ratified by Mobutu.

He then announced his government line-up without getting prior approval from Mobutu, contrary to the 1994 constitution, which he also rejects.

His overtures to Kabila's rebels were snubbed. They had earlier warned him not to assume the premiership and insisted they would not work for any government while Mobutu was president.

Press reports in Kinshasa said the "family" of oppposition parties, the Political Conclave Force (FPC), was ready to meet Friday to decide whether to replace him.

Under the 1994 constitution, the opposition suggests the prime minister, who must be approved by Mobutu. In turn the premier must name a government that includes supporters of the president.

In Pretoria, the domestic SAPA news agency quoted unnamed diplomats as saying the peace talks would likely begin on Sunday.

SAPA said officials were locked in "delicate discussions" to prepare for the talks between Mobutu's envoy Honore Ngbanda Nzambo and representatives of Kabila.

Nzambo arrived Thursday while the rebel delegation led by Bizima Karaha, in charge of international relations in the rebel alliance, was reported to have left Goma in eastern Zaire.

South African officials on Friday would not confirm the rebels' arrival, nor whether the talks would start Sunday.

Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire will be able to negotiate from a position of strength with troops advancing toward the key Zairean towns of Lubumbashi and Mbuji Mayi.

Since they began their offensive in mid October, they have seized more than one quarter of Zaire, including the third city Kisangani, and pledged to march into Kinshasa by June.

Zairean soldiers were reported to have begun looting and shooting early Friday in Mbuji Mayi, the capital of diamond-rich Eastern Kasai province.

So far in the six-month Zairean conflict, government soldiers have gone on the rampage before fleeing without a fight. Tensions in Mbuji Mayi have been high in expectation of an imminent rebel attack.

Rebel forces are also reported to be closing in on Lubumbashi, Zaire's second city and the capital of the mining-rich Shaba province.

In New York overnight, the United Nations called on Kabila to "stop the killing" and let humanitarian aid organizations work unhindered to aid the several hundred thousand refugees left helpless by the civil war.

The United States separately called on Kabile to assist in repatriation of refugees, and to reconsider his rejection of the invitation to join the new government.
