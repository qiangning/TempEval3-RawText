Mongolian Prime Minister Miegombyn Enkhbold on Thursday refuted news reports claiming that Mongolia was setting up refugee camps for people from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

"There are some news reports or rumors that Mongolia is preparing to receive refugees or setting up refugee camps in Mongolia, but these reports are groundless," Enkhbold told reporters at the Mongolian Embassy in Beijing.

Mongolia and the DPRK have longstanding relations and Mongolia has always supported a nuclear weapon-free Korean Peninsula, Enkhbold said.

"Our position is to solve the nuclear issue through political dialogue and cooperation," the prime minister said. "The Mongolian government is willing to implement the UN resolution on Korean nuclear issue."

"We hope for the success of the six-party talks and we support the initiatives and activities of the six parties," Enkhbold said.

As part of the UN refugee commission, Mongolia will treat refugees from a humanitarian point of view, he said.
