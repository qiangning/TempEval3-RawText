Pope Benedict XVI, who hopes one day to visit the Holy Land, on Wednesday met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in Italy as part of a brief European tour mainly aimed at drumming up support for sanctions against Iran's nuclear programme.

The Israeli leader was given a private audience with the pope and was then to meet the Vatican head of government, Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone. The head of the Roman Catholic Church said in August he hoped to visit the Holy Land, if possible "in times of peace".

Olmert, who flew to Italy on the second and final leg of a European visit, was then to meet his Italian counterpart Romano Prodi.

In Germany, his previous stop, Olmert won backing for anti-Tehran sanctions from Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said that "unfortunately the time has come for sanctions" after Iran had turned its back on attempts to persuade it to stop enriching uranium.

Olmert's spokeswoman Miri Eisin told AFP that Rome too was expected to rally behind moves by Israel and the United States to try to bring Iran into line.

Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, who has threatened to wipe Israel off the map, says his country's nuclear programme is aimed at purely civilian use.

Also during his talks with Prodi, Olmert will "underline the importance for Israel of Italy's participation in the Interim United Nations Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)," Eisin said,

Rome is to send 2,500 troops and take over command of the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, which was beefed up after a 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in July and August.

As part of the UN force, German navy ships have been patrolling the Lebanese coast to prevent any arms smuggling into the country.

Olmert will also raise possible ways of reviving dormant peace talks with the Palestinians, provided Europe continues to boycott the Hamas-led Palestinian government, Eisin said.

"Germany, Italy and Europe in general have a role to play to advance the peace process," Eisin said. "But there cannot be any recognition of the Hamas government as long as this movement does not recognize Israel and does not give up its mission to destroy it."

Although Olmert said in Berlin on Tuesday that Israel remained opposed to talks with Syria as "the time is not ripe", Rome, which for its part favours dialogue with Damascus, is expected to discuss how European nations could play a role as an interface between the two camps.

Italy too will urge Israel to agree to place the disputed Shebaa Farms area, a small corner of land sandwiched between Lebanon, Syria and Israel, under UN administration, Italian diplomatic sources said.

The sources said this would bolster the hand of beleaguered Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora whose country has demanded sovereignty over the area since 1967, while Israel argues it is part of the Syrian Golan Heights annexed at the time.

The UN has offered to administer the territory pending a settlement.

"We will also seek how to develop the European observer mission at the Rafah border (between Gaza and Egypt) to guarantee better freedom of movement," the Italian sources said.
