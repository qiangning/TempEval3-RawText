A newspaper opinion poll published Wednesday, eight days before the British general election on May 1, "electrified" the hitherto predictable campaign by appearing to suggest that previously discontented Conservative voters were returning to the fold.

An ICM poll for the left-of-centre Guardian newspaper suggested a dramatic fall in support for the main opposition party Labour to just five percent.

According to the survey, Labour's lead had fallen nine percent, with Labour support falling three points to 42 percent of voting intentions. The Conservatives were up six on 37 and the centrist Liberal Democrats on 14.

The result, the first time the Labour lead has been measured in single figures since Tony Blair took over as leader three years ago, was balanced by a Gallup poll in the right-wing Daily Telegraph which put Labour's lead at 21 percent.

This suggested Labour had increased its lead still further, rising three points to an absolute majority of 51 percent, while the Tories were down two points on 30 percent and the Liberal Democrats steady on 12 percent.

The last two Gallup polls have shown Labour steady at 16 points ahead but the latest survey of 1,129 voters on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday indicated a shift in mood.

The ICM poll was carried out on 1,004 voters on Sunday and Monday.

ICM reported that nearly half of voters who had chosen Conservative at the last election in 1992 but who had switched to Labour or Liberal Democrat at the beginning of the campaign almost five weeks ago now indicated they would vote Conservative again.

ICM also found John Major was judged to be the best prime minister ahead of Blair, and that the Conservatives would be the best party to handle the economy and represent Britain in Europe.

The result backs up assertions by Major that the polls, which have given Labour leads of up to 28 percent, do not reflect the reception Tory candidates have garnered around the country. A party spokesman declined to comment on the latest findings.

A Labour spokesman said: "It is extremely difficult to take any clear message from tonight's polls. They are so contradictory."

The British press claimed the ICM poll had thrown open the campaign. The Guardian called the result a "bombshell for Labour", the right- wing Daily Mail said the poll had "electrified" the campaign, and the Telegraph quoted Conservative sources who claimed it showed their tactic to focus on Europe and Blair's credibility were paying off.

ICM's result is the lowest any pollster has recorded for Labour for five years, but the company has consistently shown a Labour lead of at least 10 points lower than those reported in other surveys.

In the last election in 1992, polls predicted a Labour victory but the Conservatives eventually won.

In this election, sources from both parties have said the polls were still exaggerating the Labour lead and political analysts agree that there will be no landslide of the kind indicated by a 20-point lead.

Many have said the poll gap between the two main parties will narrow as election day approaches, as has happened in eight of the last nine general elections.
