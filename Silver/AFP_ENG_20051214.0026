A crackdown on the media in Nepal through a government ordinance is illegal, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) said in a report Wednesday.

The ordinance issued in October violates Nepal's international human rights obligations and the constitution, the Geneva-based group said, calling on the government to repeal it immediately.

ICJ secretary-general Nicholas Howen said it "seeks to provide a legal cover for unlawful practices and restrictions used by the government to suppress freedom of the media and the right of Nepalis to receive information."

The ordinance followed the seizure of power by King Gyanendra in February.

He sacked the former government, ostensibly for failing to quell a bloody Maoist revolt, but earned international censure and sparked popular demands for a restoration of democracy.

Under the ordinance, security forces have raided radio stations, seized radio transmission equipment, enforced restrictions on broadcasting news and detained and harassed journalists.

"Enforcement of the ordinance will have a chilling effect on the media and lead to greater self-censorship as journalists try to predict when the authorities will try to silence a newspaper or broadcast or close down whole media operations," said Howen.

The report, Power to Silence", describes how the government is suppressing criticism seen as politically sensitive and barring journalists from working professionally.

"Many of the vague and ill-defined provisions open the door to arbitrary and abusive application of the law," the report said.

"The purpose of the ordinance seems to be to close down critical media, rather than legitimately regulating the media," added Howen.

The report welcomed two Supreme Court interim orders instructing the government not to enforce aspects of the ordinance.

The ICJ also called on Maoist rebels to respect human rights and press freedom.

It said it was "disturbed" by media reports that the Maoists had violated a deal for democracy with mainstream parties by harassing a group of journalists and seizing their equipment.
