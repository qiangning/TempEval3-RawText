Venezuela on Tuesday signed an agreement to purchase a satellite from China as part of a plan to guarantee its telecommunications autonomy, the Venezuelan government said.

At the signing ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Caracas, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez thanked China for the scientific and technological support, saying the satellite will help Venezuela develop its own industries of telecommunications, movies and TV, culture and education.

The satellite, named after Simon Bolivar, the famous South American independence hero, will be send into orbit in 2008, according to the Venezuelan Ministry of Science and Technology.

The satellite will provide telecommunications services to all parts of Venezuela, including scarcely populated areas that have never been reached by commercial communications firms.

The ministry said the satellite will also help in the early detection of natural disasters and be used to broadcast educational and information programs.
