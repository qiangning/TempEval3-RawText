Hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli troops here Wednesday following the funeral of one of three men killed in rioting the previous day in the divided West Bank city, witnesses said.

The clashes came after Israeli police released two Jewish settlers whose slaying of a Palestinian man in central Hebron Tuesday sparked several hours of deadly clashes between protestors and troops.

Police officials said investigators accepted the account of the settlers, religious students in their 20s, that they opened fire with automatic weapons in self-defense after being attacked by tear gas as they walked near Hebron's Jewish enclave.

A second Palestinian was wounded in the shooting.

At least three Palestinians, including a policeman, were wounded by rubber bullets fired by soldiers after the protestors began pelting them with stones on Wednesday.

The new clashes broke out after 1,500 Palestinians turned out for the funeral of Nadir Said, 24, one of two men killed by Israeli rubber bullets in Tuesday's unrest.

Mourners called for revenge and chanted "No more settlers" as they carried Said's body wrapped in a Palestinian flag to his grave.

Palestinian police deployed large numbers of men around the Jewish quarter in a bid to prevent new clashes as the mourners and other protestors fanned out towards the Israeli lines.

But hundreds of youths skirted the police positions to confront the troops.

In Tuesday's unrest, hundreds of Palestinians threw stones and firebombs at Israeli troops guarding the Jewish enclave, where 400 settlers live surrounded by 120,000 Arabs.

Two Palestinians were killed and some 100 wounded by rubber bullets as the troops battled the protestors. Five soldiers were hurt by stones.

It was the deadliest day of clashes since almost daily violent protests erupted after Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in disputed east Jerusalem on March 18.

In all, five Palestinians have been killed in the battles and hundreds injured. Three Israelis were killed by a Palestinian suicide bomber in Tel Aviv on March 21.

Hebron has long been a flashpoint for Arab-Israeli violence.

Four-fifths of the city passed to Palestinian rule in January under a breakthrough agreement which many hoped would give new life to a peace process in deep trouble since the nationalist right-wing took power in Israel in June.

But Israeli troops continue to guard the enclaves where the Jewish settlers live. The Israeli-controlled zone was under curfew Wednesday.
