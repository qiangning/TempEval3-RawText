Al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri vowed in a videotape aired Wednesday that the terror group will not stop attacks on US soil as long as the United States strikes Muslims on their land.

"If we are hit in our countries, we will not stop striking you in your country," Zawahiri said in the video broadcast on pan-Arab television station Al-Jazeera.

He said US President George W. Bush was deceiving Americans by telling them he was going after terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq in order to keep them away from the United States.

He also said the United States will ultimately talk with "the real forces" in the Islamic world in order to extricate itself from Iraq and Afghanistan, in a reference to Islamist extremists.
