The Zambian government released on Wednesday a budget plan, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework ( MTEF), for the year 2007 to 2009 to project revenues and outline expenditures for the period.

Speaking at the launch of the plan, Secretary to the Treasury Evans Chibiliti said the three-year plan would focus on consolidating the macro-economic stability achieved in the last few years.

"In this regard implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies will continue, particularly by limiting government borrowing," Chibiliti said.

He said government plans to strengthen tax administration and resource mobilization, adding that the three-year budget plan has also incorporated the implementation of the decentralization policy which aims at empowering local authorities to control their own resources.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister N'gandu Magande said the government projects to raise about 32 trillion kwacha (about 8 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue and grants between 2007 and 2009 while the expenditure is projected at 34.3 trillion kwacha (about 8.6 billion dollars) over the same period.

The minister said the government hopes to achieve economic growth of six percent a year and to bring down inflation to no more than five percent from the current level of eight percent.

Magande said the government will in the next three years focus on infrastructure development which includes construction of road, schools, houses and water and sanitation facilities.

The draft plan will be released for public consultation and contribution, said the minister.
