Macedonian leaders cracked open the champagne Saturday to celebrate a decision by European Union leaders to bring their country closer to membership of the bloc, describing the move as recognition for recent reforms.

"This is a big day for us, we received recognition for everything we have done in the recent past," Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski told the state-owned Mia news agency after winning a green light to open accession negotiations with Brussels.

"The path is paved now and we know that we have real friends (in the EU) that value all our efforts. I congratulate all citizens of Macedonia for such a great success," Buckovski said.

In a separate address to the nation, President Branko Crvenkovski said the decision to give Macedonia candidate status "also brings a huge obligation to continue with even more devotion along the same road towards the goal."

"Macedonia has strength, knowledge, the will and determination to achieve its strategic goal," Crvenkovski said.

Fulfiling a promise given publicly a while ago, the EU's representative in Skopje, Erwan Fouere invited Buckovski, Crvenkovski and other Macedonian top officials into a popular cafe in downtown Skopje and toasted them with Irish whiskey.

At the celebration Buckovski gave bouquets of red roses to Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva and Deputy Prime Minister in charge of European integration Radmila Secerinska, saying the two women were the most responsible for the success.

The Macedonian government met in extraordinary session to define an "action plan" of further steps necessary ahead of the beginning of talks on membership, although EU leaders did not set a date for negotiations to start.

Ahead of the session, Buckovski opened a large bottle of champagne to celebrate the decision with members of his cabinet.

"Today we got a visa for our European path. Macedonia finally leaves the Balkan road paved with cobblestones and joins a highway that leads to Europe," Buckovski said.

"The European Union showed it believed in Macedonia's story. Today it is clear that Europe needs Macedonia," he added.

Agron Buxhaku, a top official of the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union of Integration, party allied in the ruling coalition with Crvenkovski's social democrats, said Macedonia had made a significant breakthrough.

"This is a very important step for the country that should mobilize all of us to fully achieve democratic standards and economic reforms," Buxhaku said.

Leader of the strongest Macedonian opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, Nikola Gruevski, welcomed the decision, but called the government to increase efforts "for the good of all citizens."

The news from Brussels had been long awaited in Skopje. Following overnight special programs waiting for the announcement, electronic media on Saturday devoted their news programs to reports and reactions.

"I have been dreaming of this moment for almost 15 years," since Macedonia gained independence in 1991, Ljupka Nikolovska, a 45-year old teacher, jubilantly said.

Few thousand people defied heavy snow and gathered Saturday evening in Skopje's main square to join celebration and listened some of Macedonia's most popular music stars.

The joyful street party ended in fireworks, but the celebration was expected to continue in restaurants and cafes that were exceptionally allowed to work overnight instead of having to close by midnight as usual.

Macedonians were also given an opportunity over the weekend to make telephone calls to any EU country at price of a local call -- telecommunication companies' contribution to the national-wide celebration.

The tiny ex-Yugoslav republic has been praised for its concerted effort to implement reforms following the end of the ethnic Albanian uprising in 2001 which threatened to spiral into all-out civil war.

The embassy of the United States in Skopje welcomed the EU leaders' decision in a statement.

"The European Council decision sends a positive message not only to Macedonia, but to all countries of the western Balkans, thereby enhancing regional stability," the US embassy said.
