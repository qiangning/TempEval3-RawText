Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Wednesday visited east China's Shandong Province.

He said it is great to pay a visit to the hometown of Confucius and he would like to see more enterprises from the province to invest in Cambodia.

Hun Sen made the remarks in a meeting with Zhang Gaoli, head of the Shandong provincial committee of the Communist Party of China.

Hun Sen said Shandong is the home to many great philosophers, mentors and strategists in ancient times and is now home to lots of big business tycoons.

Cambodia is looking forward to their investment, he added.

Zhang said Cambodia has developed rapidly under the leadership of Hun Sen.

Hun Sen visited the memorial temple, mansion and cemetery of Confucius in Qufu, a central city in Shandong and an agricultural hi-tech zone in Jinan, capital of Shandong.

The Cambodian prime minister arrived in Shandong on Tuesday after a commemorative summit on the 15th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

He will leave here on Thursday.
