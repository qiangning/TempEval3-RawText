Malaysia is committed to strengthening bilateral relations with Zimbabwe, especially in the area of agriculture, outgoing Malaysian ambassador to Zimbabwe Shaharuddin Som said here on Thursday.

He said this while addressing journalists after paying a courtesy call on Vice President Joseph Msika to bid him farewell at the end of his four-year tour of duty.

"Zimbabwe is one of the countries that we are seeking to enhance cooperation with. We are looking at various areas of cooperation, especially agriculture," he said.

During the meeting, Som, who is expected to leave at the end of the month, also assured the vice president of Malaysia's support for the country, especially in addressing colonial imbalances.

Malaysia and Zimbabwe enjoy strong economic relations that encompass areas such as agriculture, transport and communications and information technology.

Zimbabwe has benefited immensely from the experiences of Malaysia in developing small and medium scale enterprises.

The Zimbabwean government has adopted a deliberate policy to move away from traditional markets in the West and establish new ones in the East in the wake of soured relations with the former as a result of the land reform program, which the country embarked on in 2000 to rectify imbalances emanating from the colonial era.

Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohammed was in the country last week on a three-day official visit, which saw him meeting President Robert Mugabe and delivering a lecture on civil service reforms.
