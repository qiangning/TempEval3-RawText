A spectacular gesture of peace to Muslims and an apparent change of heart about letting a Muslim country into the European Union turned Benedict XVI's visit to Turkey into a major event, many analysts agreed, but some took it all with a grain of salt.

Just 11 weeks after he outraged Muslims by appearing to equate Islam with violence, the pope made a stunning conciliatory gesture Thursday, assuming an attitude of Muslim prayer while facing Mecca in Istanbul's Blue Mosque.

The moment was "even more meaningful than an apology" for the remarks made in September in Ravensburg, Germany, said the mufti of Istanbul, Mustafa Cagrici, who was the pope's guide during the mosque visit.

"It is a great gesture of peace," commented Dalil Boubakeur, a moderate French Muslim leader and rector of the Paris Mosque. "One can only see in it a profound indication of the fraternal ties between Islam and christianity."

"It is an act of great symbolic and theological -- even historic -- significance," he said.

The pope's words and gestures about Muslims "turned the page on the sorry episode of Ravensburg," agreed Algerian academic and thinker Mustapha Cherif, who had a private audience with the pope on November 11.

"We have turned a fresh page in relations between Islam and Christianity," Cherif said.

But Turkish researcher and religion expert Aytunc Altindal, scoffed at reports that the pope had "prayed" at the Blue Mosque.

"Like everything in the pope's trip, it was very well orchestrated," he said. "He adopted the prayer stance that all early Christians did until the year 325, the same as the Jews, with hands crossed across the waist."

In any case, he pointed out, the pope did not cross his hands the way Muslims do, right hand clasping left wrist with fingers joined, but "with three fingers spread, in the sign of the Trinity."

Even before the controversy over his remarks on Islam, Benedict XVI had earned the sobriquet of the "anti-Turkish pope" for having said, while still Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, that allowing overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey into the EU would be "a grave error ... against the tide of history."

He made a what was widely perceived as a stunning U-turn moments after arriving in Ankara Tuesday, saying he backed the candidacy in remarks to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who reported the conversation to journalists.

Most analysts were pleased, but cautious.

"If Benedict XVI maintains his support for Turkey's EU membership after he leaves Turkey, it would be an historic turning point," commented Cengiz Aktar, an Istanbul academic and a specialist on the EU.

"Turkish diplomats have been trying for decades to get a (positive) word from the Vatican, but no avail," he said. "Considering the weight of the Pope's words on Christian-Democratic parties and public opinion in Europe, this is revolutionary."

"I noted with great satisfaction that he changed his stance on Turkey's EU membership," said Fouad Alaoui, a radical Muslim leader from France. "I hope this progress is not simply a requirement of his position, but a personal conviction as well."

"He said extremely friendly things about Turkey," Boubakeur said. "It is a country all Muslims hold dear because we remember that Turkey controlled the destiny of Islam and of Muslims during the Ottoman Empire."

The only sour note again came from Altindal.

"The Prime Minister (Erdogan) misled us" when he said the pope favors Turkey's EU membership, Altindal said.

"In fact, there was no change. He does not want to see Turkey in the first circle of the EU," the researcher said.

"There was only one reason for the pope's visit," he said, "and that was to proclaim the Ecumenic nature of the Orthodox church and take it under the wing of the Vatican. In that, he succeeded."
