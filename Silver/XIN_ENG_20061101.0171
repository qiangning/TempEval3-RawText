Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President George W. Bush will hold their first talks in mid-November on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Hanoi, Kyodo News reported on Wednesday.

The two leaders agreed on the schedule through a telephone conversation the day after Abe stepped onto the post of prime minister on Sept. 26, Japanese government sources said.

Their topics of discussion are likely to include the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the realignment of U.S. military presence in Japan, and the reinforcement of the Japan-U.S. alliance, the report quoted sources as saying.
