Leaders from African countries told the European Union (EU) on Friday that Africa needs aid, but not interference in their reforms and policies.

"Stop interfering in the decision-making process of African states," Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni told a conference on state governance in Africa hosted by the European Commission (EC) in Brussels.

The conference was attended by World Bank director Paul Wolfowitz, more than 15 African leaders and EU ministers. Museveni said his country risked an electricity shortage because donors had pressured it to stop building dams on the Nile.

"Do not use your wealth and power to try to create us in your image," said Botswana's President Festus Mogae, adding that governance "cannot be a one-way street, an instrument to be used by the strong against the weak."

The EU dubs itself the biggest aid donor in the world, saying it provided 43.3 billion euros (around 55 billion U.S. dollars) in 2004, of which half went to Africa.

For 2008-2013, some 3 billion euros (around 3.8 billion U.S. dollars) will be allocated to reward countries for applying reforms that the EU calls good governance.
