The Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) has declared that there will be no by-elections this year because the electoral process can not be concluded in months, Nation Online of Malawi reported on Thursday.

The declaration came when political parties are busy with campaigning for vacant constituencies for possible by-elections this year.

"Honestly speaking, people should forget by-elections this year because apart from shortage of commissioners, the electoral process is long and cannot be finished within two months," said MEC spokesperson Fegus Lipenga.

Lipenga said that even if President Bingu wa Mutharika can appoint commissioners now, there still will be no by-elections immediately because they have to be briefed on the operations of the commission before they start working.

He also said the commissioners then have to decide on the date of by-elections which would be followed by official opening of the campaign period of about two months."Then there is also the issue of registration and  a cost proposal has to be sent to the Treasury so that they can release money which also takes time. So you can see that it is not easy to conduct by-elections within two or three months from now," Lipenga said.

Mzuzu University political analyst Noel Mbowela said the failure to hold the by-elections in time when a vacancy falls infringes rights of the people in the affected constituency to be represented in the parliament.

Mbowela also criticized the system of allowing the president to choose electoral commissioners. He asked the executive branch to treat vacancies in the National Assembly as a matter of urgency and make sure that they are filled quickly.

The failure to hold by-elections would affect many aspiring candidates and political parties who hoped the polls would be held and have already spent a lot of money on campaigning.

Malawi's constitutional court Tuesday ruled that the parliamentary speaker could declare scores of disputed seats vacant, making possible the ouster of President Wa Mutharika.

Wa Mutharika's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) might stand to lose 70 members of the parliament in the 139-seat assembly following the court's ruling on seats occupied by lawmakers who defected last year to join the DPP, enabling it to become the governing party.
