A fire in an electrical transformer forced the closure of Brazil's Angra I and Angra II nuclear power stations early Friday morning, state-owned nuclear electricity company Eletronuclear said.

The fire triggered the automatic protection system, which immediately shut down the nuclear electricity generation units of the two nuclear power stations, located in Rio De Janeiro state, Eletronuclear said.

The accident happened outside the Angra II plant and was not related to the nuclear generators, said the company, adding that no abnormalities have been recorded inside the plant.

Angra II will remain closed until investigators find the cause of the fire.

The automatic system disconnected Angra I automatically, although it has no problems inside or outside. It will resume electricity generation straight away, Eletronuclear said.

The southeast of Brazil will not have access to the 1,350 megawatts of electricity generated by the two plants, but other generation sources will make up for the loss, it said.
