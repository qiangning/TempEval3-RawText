Shanghai police have raided the home of a second underground Catholic priest carting away money and religious items, a US-based pressure group said Wednesday.

The Cardinal Kung Foundation said in a statement faxed here that six public security officials searched the home of Father Zen Caijun on March 29 for five hours and took away cash, a video casette recorder, religious videos and other electrical goods.

"The raid consisting of six policemen started in the late evening March 29 until early morning of March 30, lasting about five hours," the statement said, adding that no reason was given for the search and no receipt issued for the goods seized.

An official of the municipal religious affairs bureau said that they knew of the incident.

"This is a secretive matter. We cannot talk about this to the public because it involves many different opinions," she said.

A public security bureau official said the police were unable to comment on the statement.

But Shanghai police did say that on March 24 they had taken similar action against Bishop Joseph Fan Zhongliang, coadjutor of the underground Roman Catholic Church. They declined to provide details.

The Stamford, Conneticut-based Cardinal Kung Foundation said police took away 20,000 yuan (2,500 dollars), bibles, rosaries, religious medals and books.

Fan, 79, is coadjutor bishop in the absence of the Vatican-appointed Bishop of Shanghai, Cardinal Ignatius Kung, who left Shanghai in 1988 to seek medical treatment in the United States where he remains today.

The Roman Catholic Church was driven underground after the Chinese government formed its own Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association in 1957. The official church is still seeking Vatican recognition.

On Sunday, US House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gringrich and Australian Prime Minister John Howard attended Easter service at an official protestant church in Shanghai.

Gringrich said it was a "wonderful thing to be able in Shanghai to be celebrating the resurrection of Christ and to worship with Chinese, Australian and with others."

"And I think it is a good sign, we want to encourage that kind of openess," he said.
