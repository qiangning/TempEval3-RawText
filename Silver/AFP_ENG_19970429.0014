New Zealand has won the legal right to fish in Antarctic waters but a senior cabinet minister Tuesday said the country was worried about illegal fishing spreading in the region.

Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Upton said there had been reports of large-scale illegal fishing of Antarctic toothfish in waters south of South Africa.

"More than 40 vessels are reported as having caught over 30,000 tonnes of the high value toothfish," he said in a statement.

Fishing in these waters was subject to regulation by the Hobart-based Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which, for the first time, has agreed to let New Zealand fish for toothfish in the Ross Sea this year.

New Zealand would be bound by strict limitations set by the convention, Upton said.

Unregulated fishing on the scale reportedly taking place off the coast of South Africa threatened the fragile Antarctic ecosystem, he said.

"It may pose a threat to the waters south of New Zealand, if reports that this fishing is continuing to spread westwards into French and Australian Antarctic waters, are borne out."
