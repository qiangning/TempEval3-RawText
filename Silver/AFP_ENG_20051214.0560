Amnesty International challenged Wednesday the conviction of an Arab-American man for conspiring to assassinate President George W. Bush, saying the court had failed to take into account torture allegations.

A US jury last month found Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, 24, guilty on nine counts, including conspiracy to kill Bush, conspiracy to hijack a plane and offering to aid Osama bin Laden's terror network.

Amnesty argued the verdict was flawed because the jury was not allowed to hear evidence supporting claims by Abu Ali that his videotaped confession, on which the prosecution relied almost exclusively, had been obtained following torture in Saudi Arabia.

Abu Ali said he was flogged and beaten by security service agents under the Saudi interior ministry and forced to confess.

"It's seriously concerning that the trial of Abu Ali may set a precedent in US courts by which statements obtained by torture and ill-treatment are accepted as evidence," said Susan Lee, Amnesty Internationals Americas Programme Director.

Judge Gerald Bruce Lee, in the federal court in Washington, ruled that only evidence that related directly to Abu Ali's interrogation would be admissible, thus denying the defence the opportunity to present relevant contextual evidence.

"Equality of arms before the court is a fundamental principle of fair trial standards," said Lee.

"The apparent absence of this fundamental right in Abu Ali's trial, especially where it considerably weakens a defendant's ability to prove that his confession was obtained through torture, has cast a dark shadow over the fairness of the trial," she added.

Sentencing is scheduled for February 17, with the defendant facing a possible life sentence.

The indictment against him said Abu Ali and another conspirator discussed two options for assassinating Bush -- either shooting him the street or using a car bomb.

Born in Texas, Abu Ali's parents were Jordanian. The family lived in Falls Church, Virginia, a Washington suburb, until Abu Ali went to study at the Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia.

He was detained in Medina in a sweep following bomb attacks in Riyadh on May 12, 2003 that left 34 dead.
