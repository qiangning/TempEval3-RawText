Three US soldiers have been killed in Iraq by a roadside bomb while on a routine patrol, the US military announced Sunday.

The three soldiers died and a fourth was wounded when the bomb exploded near one of their vehicles north of Baghdad on Saturday, the army said.

The latest deaths bring the number of US fatalities in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 2,944 according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures. In December alone, at least 61 have died.
