The Cleveland Indians, in search of a replacement for Kevin Millwood, have agreed to terms with veteran righthanded pitcher Paul Byrd on a two-year deal, ESPN reported on its website on Sunday.

The deal is worth 14.25 million dollars, ESPN reported, and Byrd, who turned 35 on Saturday, can receive up to 22 million dollars if the Indians exercise their club option for the 2008 season.

Originally a fourth-round pick of Cleveland in 1991, Byrd is coming off a productive season for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, during which he went 12-11 with a 3.74 ERA in 31 starts for the American League West champions.

Byrd, who has made a career out of changing speeds and arm angles, struck out 102 in 204 1/3 innings but walked just 28.

He effectively is stepping into the hole in the Indians' rotation vacated by Millwood, who went 9-11 with a league-best 2.86 ERA last season but is expected to leave via free agency.

In parts of 10 major league seasons with five different teams, Byrd has a career record of 72-64 with a 4.23 ERA. A former All-Star, Byrd's best season came with Kansas City in 2002, when he went 17-11 with a 3.90 ERA.
