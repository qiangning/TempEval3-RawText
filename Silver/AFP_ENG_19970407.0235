President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani inaugurated Iran's largest and most modern petrochemical complex in the northestern city of Tabriz on Monday, official sources said.

The new project in East Azerbaijan province will make Iran the second largest producer of petrochemicals in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia, with an estimated annual output of 13 million tonnes, state radio said.

The new complex has an annual capacity of 311,000 tonnes worth around 300 million dollars, its director Abbas Sedghi told Iran's official news agency IRNA.

"Given the high quality of its products, we expect to export up to 150 million dollars in petrochemicals," he said without elaborating.

Sedghi said Iran had received technical assistance for the complex from France, Italy and Germany and that 750 million dollars in foreign loans had been obtained to finance the project.

Parliament has authorized the government to secure up to 2.8 billion dollars in foreign financing to develop the petrochemical sector during the current Iranian year, which started on March 21.

The assembly on Tuesday imposed a ceiling of 16.7 billion dollars for hard currency spending this year.

Iran expects to earn around 18 billion dollars in oil receipts this year.
