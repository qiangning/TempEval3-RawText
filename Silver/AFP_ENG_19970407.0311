The controversial German writer Stefan Hermlin died overnight in Berlin at the age of 81, his publisher announced Monday.

Hermlin was one of the leading figures of official Communist literature in the former East Germany, and was awarded the National Prize several times by the state.

He was a Communist militant from his youth, and was active in the struggle against fascism. He also spoke out for East German dissidents like singer and writer Wolf Biermann.

In 1937, Hermlin emigrated to Palestine, then moved to France in 1940 before moving to Switzerland in 1943.
