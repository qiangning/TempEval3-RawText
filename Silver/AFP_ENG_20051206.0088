The court trying former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein on Tuesday called a 10-minute break to sort out a technical problem over how a woman witness could best testify without her voice being identified.

The woman sat in court behind a green curtain and began to give her testimony relayed with her voice disguised for security reasons, but defence lawyers protested and charged that her testimony was incomprehensible.

Judge Rizkar Mohammed Amin then ruled that the audio feed to journalists in the tribunal's press box be cut, allowing a woman -- identified only as witness A -- to speak without her voice being identified.

"Cut the audio to the outside and let the witness speak with her normal voice," said Amin.

Journalists following the court hearing are sat behind a glass window, but Amin then ordered a 10-minute break to decide how best the woman could speak.

"Everyone has to hear," Amin said.
