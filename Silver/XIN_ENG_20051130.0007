Farmers of Eastern Chitwan in central Nepal, who were affected by the lack of buyers and relevant market of the green vegetables they produce in their own land, have been able to increase annual income after having set up an Agro-production Collection Center in the district.

The selling and storing of vegetables in the highly equipped collection center has benefited at least 6,000 farmers of six Village Development Committee (VDCs) of this area, Chairman of the center, a non-government organization, Chudamani Bartaula told reporters on Wednesday.

Through this collection center, a total of 2.9 million kg of vegetables worth about 42.9 million Nepali rupees (612,857 US dollars) was sold last year, which has been considerably contributing in the economic development or the rural area, Bartaula said.

According to Bartaula, the local cooperative organizations have also been providing loans so as to make the business more effective and to enhance the living conditions of the farmers.

Up to now, the center has invested a total of 196,000 rupees (2, 800 dollars) as a loan to the farmers and has also been providing technical assistance in order to expand vegetable production through 228 shareholders.

Now, the commercial vegetable production is on 2,000 hectares of land in the VDCs, and the farmers of this area are becoming self-reliant gradually after the establishment of the center two years ago, Bartaula added.
