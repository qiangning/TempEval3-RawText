Mary Pierce and her French fellow Amelie Mauresmo will meet each other on Sunday's final after both winning their semifinals in the WTA Tour Championships here on Saturday.

Pierce beat top-ranked American Lindsay Davenport 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6), while Mauresmo defeated defending champion Russian Maria Sharapova 7-6 (1) and 6-3.

No French player has ever won the championships, although Pierce was runner-up in 1997 and Mauresmo finished second in 2003. Pierce had 10 aces in a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 round-robin victory over Mauresmo on Friday.

Sharapova appeared listless against Mauresmo, falling to 4-7 in semifinals this year. The 18-year-old Russian hasn't reached a final since June when she won a Wimbledon warmup at Birmingham.

She has been bothered by a strained right chest muscle since August, and it hurt during the match.

"I couldn't serve very big, especially in the second set," she said. "That's not very good when you're playing a top player in the semifinals. Without the injury, I felt like I was in control and that still gives me a lot of confidence for next year."

Sharapova broke Mauresmo to open the match, built a 5-2 lead, then double-faulted away the tiebreaker after committing five forehand errors -- among her 39 unforced errors.

"At 5-2 down, I felt I could still come back," Mauresmo said. "I only had one bad game on my own service. I didn't know she got injured. Maybe that's why she didn't manage to put her first serves in on big moments."

Sharapova saved one match point and held trailing 5-3, then led 30-love in the next game. But she made four consecutive errors to end the match, sending a backhand wide on the final point.

She made a lowly 19 percent of her second serves, while Mauresmo 's first-serve percentage was 81.

Pierce led 4-0 before Davenport won three straight points. The American closed to 5-4 on a big forehand, but trailed 6-4 on a netted forehand. Davenport used her big serve to get to 6-5 before Pierce won the first tiebreaker on a net cord forehand.

There were no service breaks in the back-and-forth second set. Davenport used a 100-mph ace to go up 6-5, but her forehand error in the next game allowed Pierce to force the second tiebreaker.

"I made a few errors in each tie break like one shot in each tie break I would love to take back," said Davenport. "And the year is over."

Pierce was 5-5 in tiebreaks this year coming in. In 11 previous meetings, they had never played a tiebreaker.

The two players combined to serve seven love games, with Pierce connecting on 70 percent of her first serves and firing 10 aces to Davenport's 12.

Davenport hit nine more winners than Pierce, but had 24 unforced errors to Pierce's 10.

Davenport is assured of ending the year at No. 1 for the fourth time in her career despite not winning a Grand Slam title. She was runner-up at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.
