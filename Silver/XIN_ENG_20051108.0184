Ministers and government representatives from 78 countries on Tuesday called for urgent efforts to increase the global share of renewable energy in the total energy supply.

They made the call in the Beijing Declaration on Renewable Energy for Sustainable Development, adopted at the conclusion of the Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference 2005.

According to the declaration, increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewables boast multiple benefits.

The benefits include accelerating the eradication of poverty, increasing job opportunities, improving air quality and public health, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change and enhancing energy security.

The declaration points out that the doubling of oil prices in less than two years has increased the economic risk of relying primarily on imported energy.

By developing renewable energy such as wind power, hydropower and solar energy, countries can create diversified energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to wide price fluctuations.

The document says that the participating countries have agreed to accelerate the research and development of renewable energy. They will also strengthen support for the transfer of technologies through North-South and South-South cooperation.

The developing countries will enhance capacity building, says the document, including establishing markets for renewable energy and increasing access to finance.
