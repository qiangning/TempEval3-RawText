Coastguard officials at the main Greek port of Piraeus have arrested the Bulgarian second engineer of a British-flagged tanker sought on manslaughter charges, the Greek merchant marine ministry said Sunday.

Vladimir Bankov, 39, will be taken to a prosecutor in the northern city of Salonika under a local warrant issued in 2000, a ministry source told AFP.

Bankov, a second engineer on board the British-flagged Zim Shenzhen, is accused of premeditated manslaughter, the source said.

The ministry did not provide any further details on the crime case.
