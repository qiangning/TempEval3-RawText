Celtic captain Neil Lennon could be facing a lengthy suspension after being sent off during his side's 1-0 victory at home to Falkirk.

The Northern Irish midfielder was giving his marching orders for allegedly head-butting the Bairns' on-loan Arsenal striker Anthony Stokes - ironically after winning an injury time penalty.

Following the red card from referee Iain Brines, Lennon flung his captain's armband onto the pitch before facing up to assistant referee Neil Brand, who had flagged to draw attention to the clash between him and Stokes, and screamed his displeasure at the official.

He then kicked the ground as he marched up the tunnel.

In addition to an automatic one game suspension, Lennon could face a further punishment after Celtic manager Gordon Strachan revealed the referee would include Lennon's angry departure in his report.

"We were both called to the referee's room but I was only there to listen. I won't say what went on as that is up to the referee and it will be in his report," said Strachan.

"It was a stupid incident but I'm not saying Neil was stupid and I didn't actually see what happened.

"To be honest I don't know why he became too agitated as we had won the penalty and were winning.

"But he's not been called a diver too often in his career as he's not really the type of player to be driving into the opposition's box so I think the Falkirk players' response to the referee's decision upset him."

Strachan also revealed the Falkirk player involved in the incident had backed Lennon.

"I didn't see the sending off so other people will need to fill me in but by all accounts from what I am hearing from some of the other coaches the two boys met with their heads together," said the former Aberdeen, Manchester United and Scotland midfielder.

"But the word I'm hearing from the Falkirk dressing room is the boy Stokes says he hardly touched him and it was not a sending off. I can only take his word for it."

Strachan himself had looked to have been raging at the referee's decision to send Lennon off but denied he was having a go at Brines.

"I was agitated but I was agitated at some of the things we were doing as well, so there was nothing to it," said Strachan.

Despite the controversial end to the match, the victory - courtesy of a superb strike from Danish midfielder Thomas Gravesen - stretched Celtic's lead at the top of the Scottish Premier League to 16 points.

The only goal, in what was an evenly balanced match, arrived in the 24th minute with a stunning strike from the former Real Madrid midfielder.

Gravesen won the ball on the edge of Falkirk's box and sent a curling right-foot shot from 20-yards beyond Australian goalkeeper Scott Higgins into the top corner of the net.

In injury time Celtic won a penalty after Lennon appeared to be fouled by Kenny Milne - sparking a furious reaction from the Falkirk players who believed the Northern Irishman had dived.

Lennon reacted and appeared to push his head into the face of Stokes and referee Brines showed him a straight red card.

After all that Kenny Miller, who had replaced Polish striker Maciej Zurawski in the 72nd minute, missed from the spot, smashing the ball off the post.

Earlier in the day Rangers defeated Aberdeen 2-1 at Pittodrie to leapfrog the Dons into second place.

First half goals from Spanish striker Nacho Novo and Czech midfielder Libor Sionko gave Paul Le Guen's side all three points despite Stevie Lovell's late consolation.
