The Chinese government should encourage food processing and logistics firms to set up systems for the recall and traceability of problem food, said a senior National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) official on Wednesday.

NDRC deputy director Zhang Guobao said China should continue the food safety market access system to build consumer confidence in food safety.

The 11th Five-Year plan on the national food industry highlighted an urgent need to improve the country's food safety.

"The fact that some food processing enterprises use illegal additives and raw materials cannot be neglected and downplayed. Food chains from farm fields to table are polluted from time to time and environmental pollution has a bad impact on food sources, " according to the plan.

His call follows a scandal this month in which red-yolk salted duck eggs were found containing the carcinogenic industrial dye, Sudan-IV, raising nationwide concern over food safety. The country's food watchdog traced to the source of the contaminated eggs, destroyed the contaminated eggs and ducks, and tightened food safety supervision.

China has yet to establish a clearly defined food recall system, but some big cities are considering their establishment.

Shanghai started a food recall system on Aug. 1.
