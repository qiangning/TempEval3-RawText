The Philippines is naturally prone to disasters but rising poverty and climate change are making the problem steadily worse, analysts said.

Despite repeated disasters, many people are too poor to leave dangerous areas, they say.

Some 30,000 people fled the Mayon volcano when it started rumbling in August only to return when the activity subsided. But this week, typhoon-triggered mudslides swept hundreds of these people to their deaths.

Roger-Mark De Souza of the Washington-based Population Reference Bureau said the danger from natural disasters here has risen markedly in recent years.

"The risk to human life from natural disasters in the Philippines has increased dramatically over the past generation," he said in a recent report.

"From 1971 to 2000, natural disasters killed 34,000 people but from 1990 to 2000, natural disasters killed or disrupted the lives of 35 million people."

Each year an average of 20 tropical storms sweep in from the Pacific, hammering the central or northern islands of the country.

Sitting on the eadge of the "Pacific Ring of Fire," the Southeast Asian archipelago nation is also vulnerable to earthquakes, at least six a day, and volcanic erruptions from its 18 active volcanoes.

It all makes for a deadly mix making the Philippines one of the most disaster-prone countries on earth, according to the International Red Cross.

In a country where more than 50 percent of the population are living on less than two dollars a day, the human cost of such disasters is enormous.

Senator Richard Gordon, who also heads the Philippine Red Cross, said that unless the cycle of poverty is tackled "these disasters will just go on repeating themselves."

For all the stark images from the devastation wrought by typhoon Durian, the scenes were troublingly familiar.

In the eastern island of Leyte earlier this year, 1,800 were killed when a mudslide caused by heavy rains obliterated the farming community of Guinsaugon.

The International Red Cross has estimated that some 5.9 million Filipinos were killed or injured as a result of natural or man-made calamities in the 10 years to 2001.

In its 2005 Disaster report the IRC said the impact of natural disasters "aggravate pre-existing poverty, creating a downward spiral of vulnerability, arresting development."

Leoncio Amadore, one of the Philippines' foremost meteorologists, believes that climate change is also contributing to the severity of the typhoons now hitting the Philippines.

"The combination of strong typhoons, excessive rain and landslides has caused a great deal of death and destruction in the Philippines.

"If we do not act urgently, climate change will further intensify the severity of extreme weather events," he said.
