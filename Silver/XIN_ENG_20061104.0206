Edmonton Oilers coach Craig MacTavish was fined 10,000 U.S. dollars Saturday for ripping NHL referee Mick McGeough after a loss to Dallas, in which a mistaken call erased an equalizer.

McGeough admitted he made a mistake in disallowing the tying goal with 4.1 seconds remaining following a 3-2 Dallas road victory Friday but the outcome stood and MacTavish was irate at the official after the defeat.

"I can't help but think that ... he feels like he's the show out there," MacTavish said of McGeough.

"You would think that if (Shawn) Horcoff knocked it back with his glove that the linesman would be able to see that. He's one person of 17,000 in the building that saw it that way. It's ridiculous."

That sparked the fine imposed by NHL vice president Colin Campbell.

"The NHL acknowledges the fact that referee Mick McGeough made the wrong call on a play late in the game, which he later admitted," Campbell said.

"While the NHL regrets the missed call, Craig MacTavish's comments after the game regarding the call were totally inappropriate and crossed the line."
