A group of sea pirates have raided a police station in southern Nigeria and carted away arms and salaries of local government workers, the official News Agency of Nigeria reported on Monday.

An eyewitness was quoted as saying that about a dozen of pirates stormed Bori Divisional Police Station in southern state of Rivers on early Sunday morning and shot sporadically to scare away policemen on duty before looting.

The pirates also took away funds belonging to the local government and burnt their bus before escaping in a boat, the witness added.

Confirming the event, police public relation officer Ireju Barasua said that a special police team had been deployed to the station and investigations had been started.

She appealed to the public to be vigilant and assist the police with useful information on the movement of strange persons and criminal activities in the area.
