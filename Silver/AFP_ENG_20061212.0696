Fabien Barthez, last seen on a football pitch keeping goal for France in the World Cup final in Berlin in July, has reportedly been offered a contract with French side Nantes.

Barthez, out of contract with Marseille since the end of last season, is wanted by Nantes to replace Serb keeper Vladamir Stojkovic, who is keen to leave.

According to France Inter radio Barthez' lawyers will study the deal which is for an initial six months with an option of a two year extension, on Wednesday.

Nantes manager Georges Eo revealed at the start of the week that he had been in contact with the 1998 World Cup winner.
