A former Italian beauty queen has claimed she was married to Egypt's deposed King Faruq, drawing immediate denials here Saturday from an Egyptian historian and an authority on the late monarch.

"She definitely was not his wife. His mistress or a girlfriend but not his wife. I am one billion percent sure of that," Magdi Farag told AFP.

The government weekly Akhbar al-Yom, in a dispatch from Rome, quoted the former Miss Naples identified as Irma Capucci Minitolo, on Saturday as saying "I was the wife of King Faruq."

"We exchanged private vows with God as our witness ... but we could not register our wedding officially. In Paris the king introduced me to his friends as his wife and said he will marry me officially once I converted to Islam," she told Akhbar Al-Yom.

Irma said she was currently writing her memoirs to set the record straight about her "matrimony" with Faruq, who was reputed to like the good life and the company of beautiful women.

Irma said she first met Faruq in Naples where her father ran the rowing club which boasted nobility among its members. She was only 7 and was chosen to present the royal couple with a bouquet of flowers. They met again in the Italian resort of Capri when she was 15 and it was love at first sight.

"I hit the ceiling when I saw it when I read this report," said Farag, a historian who specialises in modern Egypt and widely considered an authority on the royal family.

Farag admitted that Irma and Faruq were linked. "I have many photographs of her and the king. But he never married after he was sent into exile." Akhbar Al-Yom also printed several pictures showing Faruq and Irma.

"There are many impostors in this game. I meet at least two each year," Farag said.

He identified one of them as Egyptian Fuad Shedid, whom claims to be the illegitimate son of Faruq from a Jewish mistress.

"Shedid is very fat and smokes cigars like King Faruq. He makes sure he gets invited to low-level embassies and goes to restaurants where he pretends he's the king's son and gets away by not paying the bill."

"After all these years people are still trying to cash on him (Faruq). This is a shame," Farag said.

The monarchy was toppled in 1952 and Faruq went into exile in Italy, where he died in 1965.

He married twice, repudiating his first wife Farida and later married Nariman.
