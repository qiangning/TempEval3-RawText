China has ordered local governments to make up shortfalls in their social security funds after it found 7.1 billion yuan (900 million dollars) had been misappropriated, state media reported Monday.

Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Security Liu Yongfu was quoted by state newspapers as saying local governments should recover the embezzled funds but must compensate for the losses if they fail to do so.

"For the funds that have been lost and unable to be recovered, the (local) governments have to compensate," according to the report.

Local governments must also submit plans to recover misused funds from illegal investments to the ministry before the end of this year, Liu was quoted by the People's Daily as saying.

"As the supervising government department... the ministry takes major responsibility. And we must learn a lesson and make timely corrections," Liu said.

The ministry will also look into building a mechanism to improve transparency by requiring local governments regularly report on the use of social security funds.

Last month, the National Audit Office said it has unearthed a total of 7.1 billion yuan in social security funds that have been misappropriated.

Most of the misused funds was used for construction of government buildings or other property projects, unauthorized overseas investment and loans to companies, it said.

"We have to strengthen reform and make efforts to prevent similar incidents from happening," the ministry was cited in the People's Daily as saying.

Meanwhile, a local official in northeast China's Liaoning province was found to have embezzled 11.5 million yuan in rural pension funds in illegal stock investments, according to the Liaoshen Evening News.

The official surnamed Fu was sentenced to three years in jail by a local court, it said.

Corruption involving national social security funds has become the focus of attention since it was revealed that about 3.2 billion yuan worth of funds in Shanghai had been misappropriated by officials in the real estate market.

The biggest political corruption scandal in more than a decade brought down Shanghai's top Communist Party official Chen Liangyu in late September and scores of officials and businessmen have been implicated since.
