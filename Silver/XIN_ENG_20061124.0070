The State Council has named senior executives of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and environmental officials who were responsible for the Songhua River pollution in northeast China's Jilin Province in November last year.

Duan Wende, deputy general manager of the state-owned CNPC and senior vice president of the New York and Hong Kong-listed PetroChina Company Limited, received a "demerit" on his personal record.

Nine other executives, including Yu Li, board chairman and general manager of the Jilin branch of PetroChina, and Shen Dongming, head of the Shuangben Chemical Plant of the Jilin branch, received disciplinary punishments ranging from serious warnings to demotions and dismissal.

Wang Liying, director of the Jilin provincial environmental protection department, received a "serious demerit" on his record. Wu Yang, director of Jinlin city environmental protection bureau, received an administrative warning.

The nitrobenzene fractionating tower of a chemical plant of Jilin branch of PetroChina Company Limited, controlled by CNPC, exploded on Nov. 13 last year. The accident killed eight people and injured 60 others and caused 69.08 million yuan of direct economic losses.
