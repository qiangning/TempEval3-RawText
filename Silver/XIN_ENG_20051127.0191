Brian McBride scored a brace to earn Fulham a 2-1 win over Bolton in the English Premier League on Sunday.

Fulham went ahead with only four minutes into play as McBride stole in to stab home Tomasz Radzinski's cross.

The American doubled the hosts' lead after 18 minutes with a crisp volley straight from Mark Crossley's goalkick.

Bolton scored through a late Sylvain Legwinski own goal but a frustrating day ended when El-Hadji Diouf was red-carded after full-time for dissent.

The high-flying Wanderers might have started the match as marginal favorites but they looked jaded after their midweek Uefa Cup trip.

Fulham, on the other hand, made a vibrant start.

Steed Malbranque and Radzinski were in inspired form, the latter's pass causing indecision in the Bolton defence and allowing McBride to nip in and score.

Radhi Jaidi might have cut out Radzinski's pass and the Tunisian defender was again at fault for McBride's second when he failed to connect with Crossley's clearance.

In between, Radzinski went close with a deflected shot that span just wide.

Bolton boss Sam Allardyce's response was to haul off Jaidi after just half an hour and Bruno N'Gotty's introduction did seem to shore up the visitors' defence.

However, Bolton struggled in attack too, with only Kevin Davies' aerial threat causing Fulham any problems.

Crossley had a rare save to make in the second half when Davies shot low and hard straight into the keeper's arms.

Bolton's unhappy day was summed up when Joey O'Brien became the seventh Wanderers' player to go in referee Graham Poll's book, meaning the club will be fined.

Fulham were briefly rocked when Sylvain Legwinski scored a strange own goal after Nolan muscled his way into the box but it turned out to be a consolation Bolton barely deserved.

Diouf's second yellow card came after full-time as he allowed his annoyance with the officials to boil over.
