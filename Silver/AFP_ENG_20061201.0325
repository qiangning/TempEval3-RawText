US President George W. Bush warned against expectations he will lay out plans for "a graceful exit" from Iraq, as news reports Friday said the independent commission looking into Iraq policy will call for a 2008 withdrawal of US combat troops.

The White House has ordered a government-wide reassessment of US policy in Iraq amid soaring sectarian violence, fears of all-out civil war, and mounting domestic pressure to bring US troops home after opposition Democrats took control of the US Congress in the November 7 elections.

High hopes for designing an exit strategy are being placed on a bipartisan commission created by the US Congress known as the Iraq Study Group, a 10-member panel of Washington notables co-chaired by former US secretary of state James Baker.

The panel's advice is a major chance for the president to overhaul his Iraq policy, even though the recommendations are nonbinding.

The panel -- which also includes former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, former top Clinton aide Leon Panetta, and until recently defense secretary nominee Robert Gates -- have written a report to be delivered to the president on December 6. Details however have been leaking to the press for days.

The report will call for a withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq by early 2008, while leaving behind soldiers for training and support, the Washington Post reported Friday.

The date is not firm, but rather a goal based on circumstances on the ground, according to the Post, citing sources familiar with the proposal.

"It's really about transitioning from a combat to a support role, and basically making very clear that this is no longer an open-ended commitment and we're going to get this done whether the Iraqis like it or not," one of the sources told the Post. "Everybody understands that we're at the end of the road here."

The Post also said the document calls for embedding US soldiers directly with Iraqi security units as early as January to improve their efficiency.

It will also recommend withdrawing 15 US combat brigades in Iraq -- the bulk of the US fighting presence -- but leaving 70,000 or more American trainers, logistics experts and members of a rapid reaction force, the New York Times reported Thursday.

The United States currently provides the vast majority of the 160,000-strong multinational force in Iraq.

Asked when Bush would reach a decision on implementing the advice, US national security adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters on Thursday: "It's going to be weeks rather than months," but offered no further details.

Separately, the Washington Post reported that US officials are looking into ending reconciliation efforts with Sunni insurgents -- a move strongly opposed by US ambassador in Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad and top military commanders, who believe that bringing the Sunni insurgents into the political process is key to stabilizing the country.

The proposal, presented by the State Department, follows an internal review that says US efforts to reach out to Sunni dissidents have failed, and perhaps even backfired and alienated Iraqi Shiites, the Post reported.

Officially US policy is to support a unified Iraq. Washington would not drop the goal, but instead would let the Iraqis take leadership in reconciliation efforts, the Post reported.

Sunnis, favored during Saddam Hussein's regime and for centuries the backbone of the ruling elite and middle class, make up about 20 percent of Iraq's population.

"We'll be in Iraq until the job is complete," Bush said Thursday after talks in Amman, Jordan, with embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.

"There's a lot of speculation that these reports in Washington mean there's going to be some kind of graceful exit out of Iraq. We're going to stay in Iraq to get the job done, so long as the government wants us there," he said.

"This business about 'graceful exit' just simply has no realism to it at all. We're going to help this government," said Bush.

Maliki told ABC television Thursday that Iraqi forces will be ready to take charge of security in the country in June 2007.

"I can say that Iraqi forces will be ready, fully ready, to receive this command and to command its own forces, and I can tell you that by next June our forces will be ready," Maliki said, speaking through a translator.

Senator Carl Levin, in line to chair the Senate Armed Services Committee, said US moves toward withdrawal will alleviate the violence in Iraq, contrary to Bush's assessment.

"I believe the announcement of a date to begin the redeployment of US forces from Iraq would increase the pressure on Iraqis to reach the political settlement that is essential to ending the sectarian violence," he said.
