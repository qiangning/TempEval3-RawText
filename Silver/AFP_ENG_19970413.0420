Singapore-based Neptune Orient Lines said Sunday it would acquire US shipping group APL Limited in a deal valued at 825 million dollars, creating the largest trans-Pacific shipping line.

Neptune Orient said it would acquire all 24.6 million outstanding shares of APL stock at 33.50 dollars per share, in an all-cash deal.

The deal, subject to US regulatory approval, would create a global shipping giant with some four billion dollars in revenues, and a fleet of 113 vessels, according to a statement from the two companies.

The new firm will be in the top six global firms in container shipping, and the biggest in the Pacific, according to company officials.

Under the deal, APL, the number two US firm, will retain its name and brand in the marketplace and will continue operations headed by its existing management in Oakland, California.

"This merger in no way lessens APL's commitment to the US flag and American seafaring labor," said APL president Timothy Rhein.

APL officials said a separate US-owned company would manage the fleet, to ensure the vessels qould qualify for US subsidies under the Maritime Security Program and to be eligible for US military shipments.

Lua Cheng Eng, deputy chairman and chief executive of Neptune, said the merger would allow cost savings of 130 million dollars for the two firms.

Neptune said the purchase will be funded by lines of credit from commercial banks and internal resources. Neptune is being advised by Goldman Sachs while APL is being advised by J.P. Morgan. The deal is expected to be finalized later this year.

APL is a leader in trans-Pacific and intra-Asia shipping, while Neptune specializes in lines from Europe to the Far East trade using the Suez canal, as well as from the Far East to United States.

Neptune is Singapore's largest shipper and a global transportation firm; APL is the second-largest US shipper.
