At least six people were killed when a bomb they were making exploded in Pakistan's tribal region near the Afghan border on Saturday, officials and locals said.

"It seems the explosion occurred when these people were busy making an improvised explosive device for terrorist activity," Pakistan's chief military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan was quoted as saying.

Sultan said that the six people were killed, one of whom was female, and that they were all believed to be foreigners although their exact nationalities were still being investigated.

Some press reports claimed that they were Al-Qaida members.

Meanwhile, locals said that eight people, including four men, one woman and three children were killed in the incident on Saturday morning in a village in Mir Ali, 20 kilometers east of Miranshah, the main town of the Pakistani tribal region of North Waziristan.
