The German media all agreed Saturday that the 2006 World Cup hosts could not have asked for a kinder finals draw after being paired with Costa Rica, Ecuador and Poland in Group A.

Germany host minnows Costa Rica in the opening World Cup match on June 9 in Munich and manager Jurgen Klinsmann was pictured with a broad grin in the press.

"Klinsmann is right to smile after that draw," said the Kolner Express. "There is no real major obstacle to the last sixteen."

Bild daily, the country's biggest selling newspaper, concurred: "Klinsmann you are certainly lucky!"

Klinsmann, who won the 1990 World Cup with West Germany, admitted the draw could have been much worse but insisted his team would not underestimate anyone.

"Of course we could have a had a much more difficult group," explained Klinsmann. "But every opponent will provide a challenge for us and the onus will be on us to attack as hosts."

Klinsmann has set the target of lifting the World Cup on July 9 in Berlin despite not defeating a recognised top nation since a 1-0 win over England in 2000.
