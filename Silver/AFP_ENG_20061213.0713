Business confidence among Japan's major manufacturers probably hit a new two-year high in the three months to December, smoothing the way for another interest rate rise, analysts said.

The Bank of Japan's closely watched Tankan survey out Friday is expected to show that sentiment among big manufacturers rose to 25 in December from 24 in September, the third quarter of improvement, according to consensus forecasts.

But market views are still divided on whether such a modest pick-up would lead the central bank to raise interest rates from 0.25 percent as soon as next week, with some analysts predicting a move early next year instead.

"We expect manufacturers' sentiment to remain steady in the face of rising uncertainty in the external environment," underpinned by solid profits and a weaker yen, predicted Morgan Stanley economist Takehiro Sato, who expected a bigger than average rise in the headline index to 26.

"For non-manufacturers, we expect to see some sense of stagnation in light of slackening demand on poor summer weather and the like," he added.

Average market expectations are for the index for major non-manufacturers to dip to 19 in December from 20 in October.

The previous Tankan report, which surveys almost 10,000 firms, showed Japanese executives growing more upbeat, with sentiment among big manufacturers jumping to 24 in September from 21 in June.

The figure was the strongest since the 13-year high of 26 seen in September 2004. A positive reading means that confident firms outweigh pessimistic ones.

But in October, the major manufacturers remained cautious about the outlook further ahead, forecasting a drop in the index back down to 21 by December.

Some analysts believed that another upbeat Tankan might be enough to persuade the Bank of Japan to hike its key rate again at 0.5 percent next week.

But others say the central bank is more likely to hold off until early next year, to ensure the Japanese economic recovery does not grind to a halt if the US economy slows sharply.

Recent sluggish data -- including a smaller-than-expected rise in machinery orders in October and a sharp downgrade to third-quarter growth, to an annualized 0.8 percent -- have dampened expectations of a rate rise next week.

In addition inflation remains subdued, with core consumer prices up just 0.1 percent in October from a year earlier.

The BoJ, which holds its next policy meeting on December 18-19, has kept its benchmark overnight call rate target at 0.25 percent since July when it ended the era of virtually free credit with its first rate hike for almost six years.

"With the December Tankan sure to join the October industrial production index in confirming the strength of the business sector, the only things arguing against a December rate hike by the BoJ are the continued sluggishness of consumer spending and the slower pace of inflation," argued BNP Paribas chief economist Ryutaro Kono.

Japan's industrial output grew 1.6 percent in October from September.

"We still maintain the BoJ will make its move in January, before fallout from the slowing US economy gets worse," added Kono.

The Tankan survey may also show that Japanese companies have revised up their capital expenditure plans, analysts said.

In October, major manufacturers said they planned to boost capital spending by 16.9 percent on average in the fiscal year to March 2007, while all companies surveyed planned to raise spending 8.3 percent.

A finance ministry survey showed last week that corporate investment slowed from its recent breakneck pace in the three months to September.

Combined corporate capital spending by non-financial companies rose 12 percent year-on-year between July and September, slowing from a 16.6 percent year-on-year increase in the previous quarter, the report showed.
