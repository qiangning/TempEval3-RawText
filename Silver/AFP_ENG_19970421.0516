A leading businessman testified Monday that he arranged payments to help former Irish prime minister Charles Haughey over financial problems while he was in office.

In the latest development of a scandal that has poisoned Irish politics for months, Ben Dunne, former chief executive of Ireland's Dunnes Stores chain, told a Dublin inquiry he was asked in 1987 to contribute 700,000 punts (1.2 million dollars) to aid the ex-premier.

Dunne has claimed he ended up handing over a total of 1.3 million punts (2.1 million dollars) to benefit Haughey over a period of years.

And he said he received thanks from the now-retired politician after personally handing over three drafts totalling 210,000 punts (342,000 dollars).

The tribunal was set up in February to trace who received 3.5 million punts of a total 5.63 million punts (nine million dollars) paid out by Dunne.

The payments controversy first came to light in November when then transport minister, Michael Lowry, resigned after it emerged that Dunne had paid for an extension worth 400,000 punts (650,000 dollars) to his home.

The court heard the money had been solicited to help "overcome business problems relating to Mr. Haughey."

Speculation over Haughey's involvement in the payoff scandal had been intense, although until Monday the name of the man referred to as a "very prominent former member of parliament" had never been officially disclosed.

Like the "sleaze" scandal which has dogged the Conservative party during the British general election campaign, the allegations and the inquiry threaten to overshadow Fianna Fail's bid to win power from the ruling coalition in general elections that could be held as early as next month.

But unlike in Britain, the sums involved are much larger, the accusations go right to the top of the party and the inquiry could run in tandem with the election campaign as any decision to suspend it is for the judiciary alone.
