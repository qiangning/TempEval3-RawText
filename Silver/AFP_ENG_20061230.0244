The cost of a single ride on a "vaporetto" -- the water bus that is Venice's main form of public transport -- will rise 20 percent to six euros (eight dollars) on February 1, the ANSA news agency reported Saturday.

An all-day ticket will cost 15 euros, and the three-day fare will rise to 30 euros, the agency said, quoting a statement from the Venice transport authority.

The hikes will not affect card-bearing Venice residents, it noted.

Fare increases are also in store for travellers on Italy's train network Trenitalia.

From Monday, fares will be up an average of nine percent on inter-city and high-speed routes, the company said.

The increases are Trenitalia's first in five years.
