Chilen President Michelle Bachelet on Monday defended her decision to deny ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet a state funeral, saying the move was made for the good of the country.

"In any society, in any country, when there are not norms, or predetermined laws for a particular situation, it is up to the leaders, the government, to make decisions in the best interests of the people," she said.

"Over the past several hours we have seen divisive acts that we don't like, but as a society and as a country we have to have the ethical strength to overcome this challenge," she said.

Bachelet, together with her parents, suffered torture during the Pinochet regime. Pinochet, 91, died Sunday a week after suffering a heart attack, escaping years of charges against his 17-year regime of human rights violations, including torture and murder.

After Bachelet's decision that the ex-dictator would be buried with military honors, rather than a state funeral and without a period of national mourning, Pinochet's relatives said representatives from the government would not be welcome at the late dictator's burial service.

"I don't want acts of hypocrisy, out of respect to my mother and my family" Marco Antonio Hiart, the youngest of Pinochet's five children, told Chilean television, as he blasted the government for failing, in his view, to accord his father the honor befitting a former leader.

Pinochet's body lied in Santiago's Military School Monday. Defense Minister Viviane Blanlot had been expected represent the government at the ex-dictator's funeral Tuesday.

The death of the former general, whose US-backed coup in 1973 toppled the Socialist government of Salvador Allende, struck a chord in this country where many suffered under his regime while supporters hailed him as Chile's savior from communism.
