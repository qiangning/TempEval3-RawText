Russian doctors treating former prime minister Yegor Gaidar have detected symptoms that "do not correspond to any known illness" but cannot say for sure that he was a victim of poisoning, Gaidar's office said Tuesday.

"The sudden development of the illness, the multi-faceted nature of the symptoms... do not correspond to any known illness," although "doctors cannot unequivocally diagnose poisoning," the office said in a statement.
