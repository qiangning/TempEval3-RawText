International pressure mounted Wednesday to deploy the Italian-led, 5,000-strong multi-national force to Albania on the ground "quickly," as food stocks there dwindle to dangerously low levels.

"It has to be done quickly," the head of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) humanitarian mission to Albania, Franz Vranitzky, said after talks in Rome with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.

Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino, speaking after a meeting with his Italian counterpart Romano Prodi in the rebel-held southern Albanian town of Gjirokaster, said: "Albania is ready, the other countries are ready, we must not waste any more time. Each day lost damages Albania."

However Dini said the force's deployment, which "not yet been decided, will be decided in common."

Their comments came before a meeting in Rome of the countries which will supply the force's troops, whose mission is to protect humanitarian aid channels in the chaos-torn country.

In Brussels, EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino added to the calls, warning that food supplies in Albania had reached alarming levels.

"There is no famine yet but we are are concerned that stocks have been reduced below safety levels," she told the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee.

Bonino said EU food and medical aid could be sent to Albania quickly using logistical structures established in the former Yugoslavia. "But only if we can solve the protection problem."

The proposed international force's role would be strictly confined to protecting the humanitarian convoys, Bonino noted. "There is no mandate for disarming rebels or anything else of that nature," she said.

"The United Nations have given us three months," Vranitzky, Austria's former chancellor, told journalists, adding that the soldiers should be on the ground "in the space of 10 or 14 days."

Italy is expected to provide 2,000 soldiers; France said Tuesday it was sending 1,000; Greece has promised up to 700 troops; Turkey, 500; Romania, 400. Hungary on Wednesday ruled out sending troops, but Slovenia, Spain and Portugal are considering doing so.

The force's mission, approved by the UN Security Council March 28, involves securing roads, junctions, warehouses and aid depots, as well as in distributing the aid.

Military sources in Rome said it was unlikely Italian troops would be sent into southern Albania, where rebels are most active, although Dini said "there were clear signals Tuesday that Italian forces would be well-received."

Last Friday, a collision between an Italian warship and an Albanian refugee boat killed four people and left 83 missing.

Albania itself would set up a volunteer force of 3,000 "well armed" and "well paid" soldiers to support the European soldiers, Albanian Deputy Defence Minister Alfred Moisiu told AFP in Tirana on Wednesday.

Vranitzky also told journalists "we have a chance to avoid" the errors committed in the former Yugoslavia, where there was an initial lack of international coordination.

"If we're not in agreement this time, it will be impossible to convince the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to give us their support," he added.

"Albania has need of aid, of restoring public order, of economic reconstruction and in restoring confidence in its political system," Vranitzky said.
