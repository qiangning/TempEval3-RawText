Villagers near the Zairean city of Kisangani threw stones Friday at vehicles of the United Nations, Filipo Grandi, coordinator in eastern Zaire for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told AFP.

Grandi said local residents attacked the UN vehicles to protest at the presence of Rwandan Hutu refugees in their area, saying the situation remained extremely tense although an uneasy calm had been restored.

Witnesses said the incident was sparked by the killings of seven local villagers 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Kisangani, deaths blamed by locals on the refugees.

"Local people blocked the vehicles on the town's left bank (of the Zaire river) to protest against the presence of refugees and thus of humanitarian organisations. Our teams were trapped in the vehicles as they were stoned," Grandi said.

He added that UN officials would investigate the claims that local people had been killed by the refugees. At the end of last month, several villagers were killed near refugee camps, sparking the looting of several UN World Food Programme trucks in retaliation.

Between 80,000 and 100,000 Hutu refugees have been sheltering in camps south of Kisangani, which was taken on March 15 by Zairean rebels fighting the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko.

They had fled westwards from camps near the Rwandan border as the rebels swept across the eastern half of the country, taking a string of key towns, and took refuge in tropical forests where relief workers could not get aid to them.

The UNHCR had planned on Friday to start a huge airlift operation to help the refugees on their way back to Rwanda, but this was delayed at least until Saturday.

Local rebel authorities failed to give the green light because of fears that an outbreak of cholera among the refugees could spread among the local population. However, the UNHCR said there was no risk and that only people in good health would initially be repatriated.

More than a million Rwandan Hutus fled their small neighbouring country in 1994 as Rwandan Tutsi rebels won a civil war in which at least 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by the Hutu former army and militia groups.

Among the refugees are armed Hutus held to be responsible for the Rwandan genocide. Many Rwandans, however, have returned home to their country, now dominated by the Tutsi minority.
