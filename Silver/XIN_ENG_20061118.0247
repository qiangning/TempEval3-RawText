Venezuelan army reserve troops were trained Saturday to guard polling stations and ballots during the presidential election scheduled for Dec. 3.

The troops were joined by members of the country's Territorial Guard, a special military division created by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

Army Col. Francisco Salcedo, who supervised training for about 1,000 reservists in Caracas said "We are charged with watching over the safeguarding of election materials and the security of the installations and people."

Chavez, who is running for re-election, has accused the opposition of working with the United States to disrupt the vote.

"Don't make me take drastic measures," Chavez warned. He urged officials, prosecutors and the military to stand ready to ensure laws are upheld and to take action against the "conspirators."
