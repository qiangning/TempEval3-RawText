A Saudi man convicted of murder was beheaded by the sword on Tuesday in the capital of the Gulf Arab monarchy, the interior ministry announced.

The ministry, in a statement carried by state news agency SPA, said Mosfer bin Mubrak al-Qahtani had shot dead a fellow Saudi, wounded a number of other people, and damaged homes and cars.

The beheading in Riyadh brings to at least 36 the number of executions in Saudi Arabia this year. At least 83 were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before.

Executions are generally carried out in public in the oil-rich kingdom, which applies a strict form of Islamic law. The death penalty is applied for murder, rape, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking.
