Nigeria's electoral agency said Wednesday that it has started to revalidate 2002/2003 voters cards for use in the April next year's presidential and general elections.

The revalidation of the 2002/2003 voters cards is "to ensure that all eligible voters are able to vote during the forthcoming general elections," the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said in an official statement.

INEC advised all those who registered in the 2002/2003 exercise to take advantage of "this unique opportunity" by visiting the nearest INEC registration centre to obtain new voters cards containing their photographs in replacement of the old ones.

Registration of voters the April 2007 poll formally ended last December 14 amid complaints that tens of millions of citizens were not recorded during the exercise.

The electoral act stipulates that the registration of voters must have been completed 120 days before the start of 2007 gubernatorial and presidential poll, an INEC official told AFP.

Governorship elections are scheduled for April 14 while the presidential poll will be held a week later.

A massive drive to put all over-18s on the electoral roll was beset by technical problems, a situation that drew the ire of the country's lawmakers who twice recently summoned the INEC boss, Maurice Iwu, to explain what they said was his agency's sloppy handling of the exercise.

The lawmakers and most Nigerians criticised the use of hi-tech polling e-machines which store voters' thumbprints and photographs, but proved ineffective in a demonstration in October.

Although 33,000 such machines were judged necessary to fulfil the demand of the populous nation's mandatory registration, officials said that less than 20,000 were deployed for the exercise.

They also cited poor mobilisation and sensitisation of the people for the exercise.

The April 2007 poll is expected to lead in May to the first democratic handover to a new government since Nigeria gained independence from Britain in October 1960.

President Olusegun Obasanjo, who has been in office since May 1999, is expected to hand over power on May 29 after the poll.
