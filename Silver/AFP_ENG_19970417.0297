Egyptian authorities have foiled an attempt to smuggle a priceless limestone pharaonic sarcophagus containing a wooden statue out of the country, a government daily reported Thursday.

The discovery was made in the town of Ihnassiya in Beni Sueif province, 125 kilometers (65 miles) south of the capital, Al-Akhbar newspaper said.

Ihnassiya is the site of the ancient city of Henen-nesut, later known as Herakleopolis, which rose to importance in the 9th-10th Dynasty when its rulers controlled large parts of Egypt.

According to Al-Akhbar, the authorities acted on a tip-off about tomb thieves in the area and carried out a raid. They arrested an unspecified number of people trying to remove the coffin by night.

The uncovered coffin contained a wooden sculpture with colorful pharaonic decorations, the newspaper said.
