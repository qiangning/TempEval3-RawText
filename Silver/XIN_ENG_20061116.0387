The Ecuadorian government on Thursday sent a letter to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to appeal against the European Union's tariff on imported bananas.

The letter said the EU tariff of 176 euros per ton, which took effect on Jan. 1, had reduced Ecuador's market share in Europe by 6.4 percent, though the total tonnage of bananas has increased.

The letter is the first step of an arbitration process. WTO procedures usually give two conflicting sides two months to reach a compromise before a group of referees are authorized to arbitrate.

The EU has already reduced its tariffs from the initial 230 dollars per ton when faced with similar arbitrage processes.

According to statistics of Ecuador's central bank, the world's largest banana exporter sold bananas worth nearly 1.1 billion dollars to Europe in 2005, up 6 percent from the previous year.
