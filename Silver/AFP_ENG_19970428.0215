Yemen's two ruling parties looked set Monday to win the country's first legislative elections since its 1994 civil war, as police announced that 16 people were killed in polling-day violence.

International observers described Sunday's polls as generally fair despite the clashes, the worst of which was a shooting in southern Yemen in which eight people died.

The interior ministry also hailed the smooth running of the elections, saying it had expected far worse violence in a country where practically all men carry firearms.

"From a technical point of view, everything went smoothly, with only minor problems," one of the 116 international observers in Yemen said.

"It can be compared to the best elections in the Arab world, for instance those in the Palestinian territories and then Lebanon or Jordan," the Western observer added, asking not to be named.

Yemen is the only country on the Arab peninsula to have a parliament elected by universal suffrage.

The General People's Congress (GPC) of President Ali Abdallah Saleh said early results showed it would scoop most of the 301 parliamentary seats, with its erstwhile coalition partner Al-Islah winning 70 seats.

The fundamentalist Al-Islah announced Monday that its chief, tribal leader Sheikh Abdallah al-Ahmar, had been elected, while unofficial sources said Saleh's eldest son Ahmad had won his first seat for the GPC in the capital Sanaa.

Competition between the GPC and Al-Islah, who fought a bitter election campaign, was especially tight in the main southern city of Aden where the two parties will win seats for the first time.

Southern Yemen was formerly ruled by the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) which boycotted the elections, complaining of a lack of national reconciliation.

Final results are not expected to be announced before Monday or Tuesday.

Yemeni voters were not deterred by the violence and turned out in force, the government said, putting the turnout at 80 percent.

The Western observer, however, estimated the national average turnout at about 65 percent, dropping to 50 percent in some areas of southern Yemen.

The worst violence came in Abyan province in south Yemen, where a soldier sprayed a polling station with gunfire, killing six other soldiers and two party officials.

In Maarib in eastern Yemen, independent candidate Saad al-Qardahi died during a clash, police said without giving further details.

Five people were killed in Aamran and Al-Jawf north of Sanaa in fights between GPC and Al-Islah supporters, while two civilians died in an ambush by tribal rivals in Dammar, around 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of the capital.

Even before Sunday three people had been killed in the run-up to elections in impoverished Yemen, where 60 million firearms circulate among the 16 million strong population.

Interior Minister Hussein Arab said voting day had gone better than expected.

"The authorities were expecting many more incidents, as the elections in Yemen did not please everyone," the minister said late Sunday.

It was Yemen's first legislative polls since the civil war when government troops crushed an attempt spearheaded by the YSP to re- establish the former Marxist republic of South Yemen, which merged with the north in 1990.
