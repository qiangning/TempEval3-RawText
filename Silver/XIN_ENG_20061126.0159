Ijaw communities in Nigeria's southern state of Delta on Saturday reached an agreement with oil companies operating in the area to restart operations.

The oil companies involved are Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Pipeline Products and Marketing Company (PPMC) and the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC).

Secretary to the Delta State Government Emmanuel Uduaghan advising all parties to keep their promise.

Uduaghan commended SPDC for keeping its promises under which the SPDC provided 21 power generating sets for the indigenous communities.

He explained that the generators which had been shipped to 15 Ijaw and six Itsekiri communities were awaiting installation. However, the government still needed to involve the PPMC and the NGC to provide potable water for the communities, he added.

He explained that the government would provide hospitals to Ijaw communities and health centers for Itsekiri communities at a cost of 5 million U.S. dollars and 1.6 million dollars respectively.

He noted that the government projects for the communities, including water and three extra generators, would cost 14 million dollars and had been approved by the federal government.

Oboko Bello, president of the Federated Niger Delta Ijaw Communities (FNDIC), assured peaceful re-entry of the companies as the communities would meet their side of the bargain.

Bello told the companies to keep to their own side of the accord since any breach in the agreement might cause problems, adding that FNDIC had already set up a committee that would work with the SPDC to ensure peaceful operations.

Mutiu Sunmonu, director of SPDC Production Office, emphasized the importance of dialogue in conflict resolution and thanked the communities for their understanding.
