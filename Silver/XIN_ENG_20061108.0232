South Africa on Wednesday held a high-profile funeral for late P.W. Botha, apartheid South Africa 's last hard-line president reviled for his regime's atrocity in the 1980s, amid calls for burying the bitter past for national reconciliation.

South African President Thabo Mbeki, as well as former president and Nobel peace prize winner F.W. de Klerk, attended a public memorial service for Botha, who died at 90 last week, in George, Western Cape.

But former president Nelson Mandela, who Botha kept in prison despite enormous international pressure to free him, as well as Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel peace prize for his contribution to post-apartheid reconciliation, were unable to attend the funeral.

While mourners including a cabinet minister who served under Botha were packing the NG Mother Church in George, where the funeral service of Botha was held, a group of protesters gathered outside the gates of the church, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) reported.

The protesters said they witnessed many atrocities under Botha' s rule, and they wanted to make sure that the former state president is buried. Security around the church remains tight, said the national broadcaster.

Botha was prime minister and then president from 1978 to 1989, and oversaw the murder and torture of thousands of black activists, army crackdowns and raids into neighboring countries that backed the anti-apartheid movement.

His death opened old wounds in South Africa, which is healing from the brutality of apartheid 12 years after the country, 80 percent of whose population are blacks, held the first democratic elections.

However, politicians gave him some credit for helping to pave the way for multiracial democracy.

In the late 1980s Botha initiated secret talks with the now ruling African National Congress (ANC), a bold step that ultimately led to the 1994 democratic elections, from which Mandela became the first black president.

After Botha's death, the government had ordered that flags at state institutions fly at half mast in honor of him and President Mbeki had offered condolences to his family. These were seen as the black government's efforts to achieve further reconciliation from the country's bitterly-divided past but it has also caused widespread resentment.

Nofatu Vywer, a protester, told SABC that Botha should be happy that he died of natural causes when many black families lost their loved ones.

"It seems it's the best day for us because some families don't have their families because of this big crocodile," Vywer said.

However, inside the church, the mourners were told that South Africans should bury the past to move towards national building and reconciliation.

Jordanian Christian missionary Dr. Bahjat Batarseh said at the funeral that having bitterness by remembering the past all the time was "like a worm that eats the root of a tree and then the tree collapses," according to the SAPA news agency.

"Bury the past or the past will bury you," Batarseh told the funeral, which was broadcast live on national television.
