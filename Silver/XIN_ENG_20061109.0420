The Myanmar government has punished 1,247 service personnel for malpractices in 2005 and 2006 as part of its measures to turn the administrative mechanism into a clean one, the official newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.

"In order to make administrative mechanism more effective, the government remarkedly increased the salaries of the service personnel and reconstituted or dissolved the organizations as necessary after making thorough reviews on constitutions and functions of the governmental department and enterprises," Prime Minister General Soe Win was quoted by the report as saying.

"The government is taking measures constantly to ensure effective and clean administrative mechanism to serve the interest of the nation and the people and to win respect and reliance of the people," Soe Win told an annual general meeting of the Union Solidarity and Development Association in the new capital of Nay Pyi Taw Thursday.

He urged service personnel on their part to safeguard the people without discrimination against or in favor of them in accordance with the law, rules and regulations, anticipating that the people will extend a helpful hand to the service personnel in return.

He maintained that by so doing then only will it be possible to set up a discipline-flourishing and genuine democracy to ensure harmony between administrative mechanism and the people.

In the first half of this year, there also existed some cases with high-ranking customs officials in connection with corruption, earlier reports said.

Meanwhile, the Myanmar government announced for the first time on Thursday allowing of the country's people to make complaints of malpractice by service personnel of any rank of the Ministry of Home Affairs in a bid to remove such practice and improve the image of the government mechanism.

The phone numbers of some high-ranking officials of the ministry and the e-mail address of the office of the ministry at the new capital of Nay Pyi Taw were published by official media for the public to dial or e-mail such complaints.

The announcement said "If any service personnel of any rank who are from the Ministry of Home Affairs commit malpractices involving money, property and opportunity and oppress the people in administrative and economic and social affairs, making improper use of the rights which are not in conformity with the existing laws and procedures can complain to the minister, deputy minister and deputy director-general".
