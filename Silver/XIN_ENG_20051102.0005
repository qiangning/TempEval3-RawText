The infrastructure projects the government will begin to implement in January 2006 are expected to absorb 1.9 million work force, Manpower and Transmigration Minister Fahmi Idris said.

After the completion of a number of infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges and their supporting facilities, some 1.9 million of the work force would find employment, Antara news agency Wednesday quoted the minister as saying on Tuesday.

Some 800,000 people have joined the ranks of the unemployed in various sectors this year, according to Fahmi.

On the other hand, the government would deregulate and eliminate bureaucracy in many sectors to improve the business climate. For example, the government would lower terminal and container handling charges at sea ports, he said.

The government would also shorten the procedures investors have to follow to begin their business in Indonesia. So far it takes more than 100 days for investors to obtain their operating licenses. This lead-time would be cut to a few weeks.

The government also plans to annul regional government regulations that are hampering investment, he said.
