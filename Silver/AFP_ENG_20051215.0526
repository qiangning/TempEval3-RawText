US ambassador David Wilkins offered an olive branch in a lumber dispute with Canada Thursday during a speech at a Toronto luncheon, on the heels of a war of words between Ottawa and Washington.

"I understand and appreciate Canada's position on softwood lumber. You have made legitimate points. I am very encouraged, as you should be, by recent developments in the past six weeks," Wilkins said, after earlier rebuffing Prime Minister Paul Martin's criticisms of US environmental policies.

Wilkins was referring to a decision in November by the US Department of Commerce to comply with a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) panel decision ordering the United States to reduce punishing duties on Canadian softwood lumber imports.

The US Commerce Department said it would recalculate its so-called countervailing duty on softwood lumber from Canada at a rate of 0.8 percent, down from 16 percent.

A separate "antidumping" duty of about four percent is not affected.

"Once that process is completed, assuming there is no (US) appeal from it, that would result probably as early as the end of January that there would be no tariffs on softwood," Wilkins said.

"It's got to play itself out, ... but that's the direction it's headed," he said, in the first sign that the United States might concede defeat in this trade dispute.

Wilkins said Washington still hoped for a negotiated settlement after Canada's January 23 election.

Canada walked away from the bargaining table in August to protest Washington's handling of the issue.

Martin said he would need a sign from Washington, such as refunding some four billion US dollars in duties collected so far, before returning to the negotiating table.

"I would submit to you that showing of good faith is there. It doesn't get any clearer than that -- the commerce department's recent decision to slash the tariffs, to render a decision that would result in the elimination of tariffs probably as early as January," Wilkins said.

Washington could still make an "extraordinary challenge" to the NAFTA panel ruling under the trade pact that would take additional time.

Meanwhile, Ottawa unveiled a plan in recent weeks to provide an additional 1.5 billion Canadian dollars (1.2 billion US dollars) in aid for lumber companies and communities affected by the trade dispute, a move that quickly drew criticism from US lumber groups.
