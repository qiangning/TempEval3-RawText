US President George W. Bush's job approval rating hit a new low of 35 percent, according to a CBS News poll released Thursday.

It is the lowest level since he took office in 2001 and one of the worst for any president.

The survey found that only 35 percent of Americans thought Bush was doing a good job compared with 37 percent in a previous CBS poll in October.

Pollsters attributed the decline partially to a five-count indictment of US Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby last Friday.

The CBS poll compared Bush's job approval rating with some other presidents at about the same point in their second term.

In November 1997, in the first year of his second term, 57 percent of Americans approved of Bill Clinton.

The job approval rating of Ronald Reagan in November 1985 was 65 percent.

A Gallup poll in November 1957 found 58 percent approval for Dwight Eisenhower.
