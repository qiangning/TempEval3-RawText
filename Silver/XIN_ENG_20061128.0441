The 30th Cairo International Film Festival kicked off on Tuesday with the opening film of Brazil's " Two Sons of Francisco" at the star-studded gala.

"Welcome to Egypt to enjoy the sunshine, especially in the winter, and (we) hope there is sunshine deep in everyone's heart," said Omar El Sherif, honorary president of the festival, at the opening ceremony at the Nile-side Cairo Opera House.

Egyptian Culture Minister Farouq Hosni inaugurated the festival, where a narrative film about the festival and its 30th edition was screened.

Meanwhile, a special documentary about late Egyptian Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz was also screened in honor of the great Arab writer.

The ceremony awarded British actress Jacqueline Bisset, the leading role in many films such as "Domino" and "New Year's Day," and American actor Danny Glover, who starred in films like "Places in the Heart" and "Mandela," as well as Argentinean director Luis Puenzo, whose film won in 1985 "Best Foreign Film" in the Oscars and the Golden Globe.

Among those honored were Egyptian stars Yousra, Mahmoud Abdel- Aziz and musician Omar Khayrat.

This year's festival will be unique, said Ezzat Abu Ouf, the new head of the festival. "This year's session will witness the return of the Film Market, which used to attract many companies from around the world."

The main international competition of this year's festival will include 19 films from 16 countries, including three Egyptian films and a Chinese film "The Road" directed by Zhang Jiarui.

There will be more than 65 films screened as official out-of- competition films, which will be the main attraction for the general public, while Saudi Arabia and Oman will present their very first feature films at the Arab film competition section.

The guest of honor, Latin America, will present a peculiar, yet intriguing group of films at the festival which will last until Dec. 8.
