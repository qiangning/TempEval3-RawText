Pa Socheatvong, Phnom Penh's Deputy Governor, estimated that the population of the city will double during the festival, but said the government has got well-prepared for the rush.

"I think we have arranged enough toilets for the crowds of people and boat races this year," he was quoted by the Cambodian Daily as saying.

Meanwhile, some 2,300 policemen, 660 armed forces and 800 official security guards will be deployed to ensure the order during the celebrations, according to reports of Jian Hua Daily.

The police have made a detailed plan to keep the city bustling but safe, it added.
