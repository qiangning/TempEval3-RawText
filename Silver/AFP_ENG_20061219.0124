Japan on Tuesday forecast slightly faster growth in the next fiscal year on the back of stronger domestic demand, as the central bank kept super-low interest rates in place so as not to take any chances.

The government predicted 2.0 percent growth in the year to March 2008 in real terms, the sixth straight year of expansion and a notch above the revised 1.9 percent estimated for the current year.

In an outlook approved by the cabinet, the government expected the economy to continue its gradual recovery in the next fiscal year, led by domestic private demand and strong corporate earnings.

The study also forecast the first growth in a decade in a key measure of inflation -- the GDP deflator -- showing that the Japanese economy is finally winning its long bout with falling prices.

But the government revised downward its economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year to a real 1.9 percent from its earlier estimate of 2.1 percent as consumer spending has weakened since the summer.

"Consumer spending is the key to whether the Japanese economy can achieve the forecast next year," said Makoto Ishikawa, a senior economist at the Japan Research Institute.

Private consumption, which accounts for the biggest chunk of the economy, is forecast to rise an inflation-adjusted 1.6 percent in the next fiscal year, faster than the 0.6 percent in the current year.

The Bank of Japan's policy board later Tuesday agreed unanimously to keep the benchmark cost of borrowing at 0.25 percent, declining to raise rates for the first time in six months.

Bank of Japan governor Toshihiko Fukui, who has repeatedly signalled he wanted to raise rates at some point, acknowledged that consumer prices and private consumption had been weaker than previously thought.

"We also found it necessary to make a more careful analysis, given the fact that consumer prices and private consumption have been weak," Fukui said.

"But we maintain our analysis that private consumption is basically in a rising trend, given the continued spill-over of brisk corporate activity to the household," he said.

In its last rate hike in July, the Bank of Japan ended its unorthodox five-year policy of holding borrowing costs at zero in a bid to stimulate the economy and end deflation.

"The BoJ may need to confirm first that consumer spending has accelerated before hiking rates," said NLI Research Institute senior economist Taro Saito, who is looking at a rate increase either in January or February.

The market had widely expected the decision after the mixed economic data, including just 0.1 percent year-on-year growth in core consumer prices.

"We need to watch closely if there is any slightest risk that Japan might return to deflation in fiscal 2007," Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Hiroko Ota told reporters.

Ota blamed rainy weather and slow income growth for the recent weak consumption data.

"But with the weather factor gone and income eventually picking up with the improvement in the employment situation, this should help buoy private consumption," she said.

On a nominal basis, which does not adjust for inflation, the government projected growth of 2.2 percent in the next fiscal year.

Japan is in the midst of its longest sustained recovery since World War II as it rebounds from the 1990s doldrums.

Last month the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that Japan's economic recovery should continue through 2008, albeit at a slower pace.

It trimmed its forecast for Japanese economic growth to a real 2.0 percent in 2007, down from a previous estimate of 2.2 percent, and warned the central bank against raising interest rates again yet because deflation still lingers.
