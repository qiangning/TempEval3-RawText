Foreign and trade ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) began their meeting Tuesday in the South Korean coastal city of Busan amid mounting gloom over trade liberalization and overshadowed by mounting terrorism and spreading avian flu.

The meeting would pave the way for an APEC summit with the participation of 21 economies in the Asia-Pacific region. The gathering would seek common ground on an open multilateral trading system and forge a unified response to terror attacks and health risks such as bird flu.

A successful conclusion of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Hong Kong next month and rapid conclusion of the WTO Doha Development Agenda negotiations are expected to be the main business concern.

On the sidelines, South Korea plans to spur discussions on bilateral free trade agreements with countries like the United States and Japan. It also plans to seek a reduction of duties applied by members of the Association of South East Asian Nations.

The region has undergone dramatic changes characterized by the December tsunami in Asia and this year's hurricanes in America, the earthquake in Pakistan and the bird flu in Asia. Last week's bomb attacks in Jordan also alerted APEC members to promote anti- terrorism cooperation.

All this may enlarge the dimension of cooperation among the 21 APEC members and breathe new life to the grouping which includes seven of the world's 13 largest economies,represents more than a third of the world's population, and constitutes 60 percent of the global economy and nearly half of world trade.

It might be easier for APEC members to find common language and common interests in coping with issues like terrorism, natural disasters and bird flu, APEC observers said.

Unlike previous summits, this year's APEC agenda would include natural disasters and bird flu and ways to enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation in these fields, said the official, who refused to be named.

As part of joint efforts, a special fund of 2 million US dollars was envisaged by APEC senior officials to fight the spread of bird flu. Other concrete measures were expected to be hammered out.

Removing trade barriers, however, remained a hard job for APEC, which puts free trade at its priority list.

APEC members will renew their own commitment to the Bogor Goals made in 1994 by forming the Busan roadmap. It calls for group members with developed economies to fully liberalize trade and investment by 2010 with developing members to do so by 2020.

Attempt to unlock the tangle in the WTO negotiations would dominate the APEC forum prior to next month's WTO meeting in Hong Kong.

In order to rescue the Hong Kong meeting, Asia-Pacific leaders were expected to plead with all nations involved in troubled global trade talks to make meaningful concessions.

Global trade talks could collapse if the current impasse over agricultural subsidies and other issues were not resolved, trade experts said.

The forum was concerned that "the current impasse in the negotiations may lead to a potential failure" of the Hong Kong ministerial meeting, said a draft statement prepared by senior officials for their leaders to sign off.

"We all agree that the Hong Kong ministerial (meeting) will be a critical step in achieving this goal" of reducing subsidies and other barriers to free trade, said the statement, whose final wording may be changed.

Throughout the past week trade officials have expressed gloom about the Hong Kong meeting, with EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson saying the talks would fail.

The so-called Doha round of WTO talks, launched in the Qatari capital of Doha in 2001, has bogged down in a bitter dispute over agricultural subsidies which has pitted mainly rich nations against developing nations.

Developing countries also argue that farm subsidies in rich nations such as the United States and EU countries depress global prices and prevent growers in poor nations from competing.

The European Union has rejected demands by the United States, Australia and some other APEC members to impose greater cuts in the subsidies.

WTO members should "make further, meaningful contributions to move the negotiations forward," said the APEC statement. "Doing this will require economically and politically difficult decisions by all WTO members."

Expectations were shrinking and hopes plummeting after negotiations earlier this month in Geneva and London failed to end the stand-off.

The statement said that while the initial expectations of the Hong Kong meeting may not be achieved, "we should nonetheless not compromise the level of ambition for the whole round" launched in Doha, Qatar in 2001.

Participants at the APEC ministerial meeting, were working hard to come up with a statement for their leaders to sign off.

The statement was expected to support the WTO, thus giving a boost to the staggering trade talks.

"What is needed at this moment is a strong message from leaders to keep spirits up," said one participant, who refused identification.

Some participants, however, were worried about the Hong Kong meeting becoming a repeat of the previous ministerial gathering in Cancun, Mexico, in 2003, which bogged down in acrimony and paralyzed the WTO for months.

"APEC would like to change this message of crisis into a message of hope," said Kim Jong-hoon, South Korea's senior APEC official.
