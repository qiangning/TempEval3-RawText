The United States and South Korea failed to get a keenly awaited reply from North Korea on their joint proposal for peace talks, but hopes lingered that a response may still come, possibly on Monday.

The top US envoy to talks between North and South Korea returned to Washington Saturday after Pyongyang's emissaries twice failed to show up for meetings here -- scheduled Friday and Saturday -- to hear their reply.

Both times the North Koreans said they were awaiting instructions from Pyongyang.

Saturday US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman left a few aides behind in New York to consult with the North Koreans on the possibility of a meeting on Monday, a US official said.

"We are working on trying to obtain a response from the North Koreans to our proposal, which we hope will be an acceptance of that proposal and that's what we are working towards," said the official, who asked not to be named.

North Korea's refusal to deliver its response confounded US and South Korean officials, who optimistically began the discussions Wednesday at North Korea's request.

The North Koreans called the meeting to give their answer to a year- old offer from the United States and South Korea to hold four-party negotiations on a peace treaty that would replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.

Under the proposal offered by President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-Sam, the two Koreas would be joined by the United States and China as intermediaries at the peace table.

China, the North's ideological ally and now an economic partner with South Korea, accepted the proposal in November.

After predicting "good results" from the talks on Wednesday, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, who heads Pyongyang's delegation, refused to resume discussions.

North Korean spokesman Kim Myong Gil told AFP the delegation was awaiting final instructions from Pyongyang. Asked whether the message could arrive Sunday, he replied: "I think so."

Seoul's envoys, also hopeful that the meeting could be held Monday, decided to remain in New York city, a South Korean diplomat said.

South Korean officials did not hide their frustration with the North's unpredictable behavior, but they also appeared to keep a cool-headed approach to the turn of events.

"If they aren't prepared, we won't push," said one South Korean diplomat.

Communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea have been locked in a tense truce under the 1953 armistice agreement that divided the Korean peninsula.

At Wednesday's meeting, the delegation from Pyongyang repeatedly raised the food crisis in their country in an apparent bid to gain more pledges of assistance, according to US and South Korean diplomats.

But US and South Korean officials reiterated that there would be no further pledges of food aid until Pyongyang said yes to peace talks.

The United States last week announced an additional 15 million dollars in food aid to help North Korea avoid famine after 1995-96 flooding that devastated farmlands.
