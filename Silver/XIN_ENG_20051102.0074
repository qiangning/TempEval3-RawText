China's coordinated, sustained socio-economic growth, in the final analysis, hinges on science and technology as well as talents. said top legislator Wu Bangguo in a meeting with noted entrepreneurs and scholars to the sixth meeting of the advisory council of the School of Economic Management (SEM) of Tsinghua University Wednesday.

Wu, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, voiced the hope that the SEM and its advisory council would increase innovation capacity and train more talented personnel on science and economic management.

The advisory council, composed of 41 members, was set up in 2000 with the aim to increase the exchanges between Tsinghua University and world-renowned firms such as Goldman Sachs, Sony and Wal-Mart.

Wu expressed his gratitude to the members of the Advisory Council for their support to China's reform and modernization drive, as well as support for the development of the cause of education in the country.

He spoke highly of a positive role the advisory council has played in introducing a new mode to run the SEM, raising the competency of teachers, and instituting an international cooperative platform.

Wu also gave the guests a detailed account of China's economic situation. During the period of the Eleventh Five-year program (2006-2010), he noted, his country will strive to build a harmonious socialist society, and pay more attention to the overall development of economic society and to the mix, quality and effectiveness of economic growth, scientific advancement, and the harmonious coexistence between humans and the nature.

John Browne, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the British Petroleum company, voiced his confidence for China's economic and social growth, and said his company will enhance cooperation with the SEM in all fields.
