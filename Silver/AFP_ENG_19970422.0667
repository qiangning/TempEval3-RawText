US officials, still hoping to bring North Korea to the peace table, held a meeting with Pyongyang's envoys in New York Tuesday to keep discussions on the proposal afloat.

The State Department said the meeting in New York touched on joint efforts to account for the remains of Americans missing from the Korean war, missile nonproliferation and the establishment of liaison offices.

But the decision to hold the meeting marked a surprising twist as US officials had insisted bilateral talks would be scheduled only once Pyongyang had given its response to proposed peace negotiations.

Senior US and South Korean envoys left New York Monday after waiting six days for Pyongyang's emissaries to deliver a response to a proposal to begin talks on a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice agreement.

US officials maintained that it was not seeking to sideline South Korea from the talks that have stalled over North Korean demands for more food aid.

"We never negotiate this issue without the Republic of Korea," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

Under the proposal made one year ago by President Bill Clinton and his South Korean counterpart Kim Young-Sam, the two Koreas would enter into negotiations on a peace treaty with the United States and China acting as guarantors.

The State Department insisted Tuesday that the peace offer remained on the table and said US officials will remain in New York to continue discussions.

"The ball is in their court and the ball will remain there until they tell us otherwise," Burns said.

The bilateral meeting was meant to prepare talks scheduled for May 12 to discuss US claims that North Korea is exporting missile technology to Syria and Iran.

The United States and North Korea also discussed "technical problems" in the way of opening up liaison offices in each other's capitals, Burns said.

US and South Korean officials also held informal contacts with the North Koreans to discuss the proposed peace negotiations.

Burns said the North Koreans continue to make appeals for food aid but he reiterated the US view that the humanitarian assistance should not be a condition for Pyongyang's acceptance of the offer.

He argued that North Korea was in need of urgent assistance, asking rhetorically: "Why would we want to link food aid to talks that are moving at the speed of molasses ?".

North Korea's food crisis will be a key topic at a meeting here Friday between Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the White House.

Japan has refused to give food aid to North Korea, citing abductions of Japanese nationals in the 1970s including a 13-year-old girl who went missing in 1977.

The United States in February offered 10 million dollars of aid and committed another 15 million dollars last week in an apparent bid to induce North Korea to come to the table for peace talks.

The United Nations World Food Program earlier this month launched a new appeal for 126 million dollars in assistance to North Korea, where UN officials have forecast famine by mid-year if there is no help.

Severe floods wiped out North Korea's harvests in 1995 and 1996, bringing food shortages stemming from the regime's economic collapse close to starvation levels.
