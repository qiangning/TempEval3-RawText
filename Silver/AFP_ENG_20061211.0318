British-Dutch oil group Shell has made new proposals for Russia's Gazprom to enter the massive Sakhalin-2 energy project it heads, Gazprom said Monday.

The offers followed months of pressure on Shell from environmental regulators that analysts said was aimed at giving Gazprom control of the 22-billion-dollar (16.6-billion-euro) project.

"On December 8, a meeting took place between Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller and Shell chief executive officer Jeroen van der Veer," who made "a number of proposals concerning the Sakhalin-2 project," Sergei Kuprianov, a spokesman for the state gas monopoly, said in a statement.

"At the present time these proposals are being analyzed. A decision will be taken in view of the existing problems at the Sakhalin-2 project, including ecological," Kuprianov said.

The British-Dutch energy giant, which controls 55 percent of the vast oil and gas development off Russia's Pacific coast, hit a deadlock in fall 2005 in talks with Gazprom on trading a share of Sakhalin-2 for onshore Gazprom gas assets.

The project came under fire from environmental regulators several months later, leading analysts to interpret the environmental campaign as a negotiating tactic to help Gazprom gain the best possible terms.

Regulators have rejected the claim and pointed to violations on the part of state companies as well, such as top environmental official Oleg Mitvol's claim Monday that "serious violations of environmental law" had been found at Gazprom sites in western Siberia, according to Interfax.

Still, MDM Bank oil and gas analyst Andrei Gromadin said the campaign against Shell "was essentially a catalyst" in compelling the company to return to the negotiating table.

Because Sakhalin-2 was initiated as a production-sharing agreement (PSA) -- a contract between the state and foreign investors that is difficult for the state to change -- "there was very little opportunity for the state to influence the project," Gromadin said.

Shell and Gazprom had reached a preliminary agreement last year to trade a 25-percent stake in Sakhalin-2 for half of Gazprom's Zapolyarnoye gas field in western Siberia.

Talks broke down in September 2005 when Shell more than doubled its initial cost projection for Sakhalin-2 to 20 billion dollars.

"The fact that Shell is proposing something -- whereas earlier they were keeping silent -- means they are willing to give something up," Gromadin said. "If this actually means a controlling stake, Gazprom should be quite satisfied."

Both Gromadin and Aton Bank oil and gas analyst Artyom Konchin said they believed Gazprom would end up with a stake of around 30 percent, which would make it the project's chief operator.

Sakhalin-2's recent regulatory problems have raised questions as to whether the operating consortium will be able to fulfill commitments to begin shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Asia in 2008.

Shell owns a 55 percent stake in the consortium, while Japanese firms Mitsui and Mitsubishi hold 25 percent and 20 percent respectively.
