Gambia's main press union renewed a call Thursday at the start of a conference on media freedom in Africa for foreign investigators to probe the murder a year ago of a journalist in the west African state.

Deyda Hydara, who was AFP's correspondent in Gambia and also worked with the media watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF), was an outspoken critic of tough media laws that authorize jail terms for journalists who violate press laws and heavy fines for their publishers.

He was gunned down late at night on December 16, 2004 while driving colleagues home from a party at the offices of The Point, the newspaper he co-edited.

The Banjul media conference, being held Thursday through Saturday, was organized by the Gambian Press Union and was to include a tribute to the slain Hydara as well as to Norbert Zongo, another investigative journalist who was shot and burned in his car in Burkina Faso on December 13, 1998.

"We call on the government to allow the intervention of outside investigators to investigate in the case of Deyda Hydara," GPU president Madi Ceesay said, opening the meeting attended by media representatives from across west Africa as well as members of Hydara's family.

Neither Hydara's murder of that of Zongo, who was deep into a probe seven years ago into the dealings of relatives and associates of President Blaise Compaore when he and three friends were attacked on a lonely road, have been cleared up.

A representative of Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontieres was unable to travel to the conference because the Gambian embassy in France failed to issue a visa in time, the group said.

Despite RSF's daily calls to the embassy, no explanation was given for the delay, it added.

RSF in June joined the Gambian Press Union in condemning an official report into Hydara's murder. It said it was "sickened" by the report by Gambia's National Intelligence Agency, denouncing an official "smear campaign".

The 23-page report described Hydara as "an instigator who stirred up the anger of a number of people through critical reports in his newspaper," The Point, of which he was co-founder.

The Gambian Press Union's president on Thursday reminded his audience of various attacks on media workers in the former British colony.

"In the last ten years we have been operating in a very hostile environment," said Ceesay.

RSF said earlier this week that it "deeply" regretted being unable to attend the conference "to express our solidarity with Gambia's independent press, which has suffered so much in recent years, but we reaffirm our commitment to see justice done."
