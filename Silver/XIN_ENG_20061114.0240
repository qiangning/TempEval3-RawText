Wholesale prices in the United States fell by 1.6 percent in October, tying with the record decline set in the same month of 2001, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday.

The big drop in wholesale prices, a gauge of inflation at the factory gate, followed a 1.3 percent fall in September and was sharper than the 0.5 percent decline expected by analysts.

Just as in September, the big drop in October was led by falling energy prices.

The core inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes volatile energy and food, dropped by 0.9 percent in October, marking the biggest monthly fall in 13 years.

The 0.9 percent drop in core inflation followed an increase of 0.6 percent in September, and reflected big declines in prices for new cars and sport utility vehicles.

While excluding new car prices, core inflation would have risen by 0.1 percent in October.

The retreat in core inflation was a welcome development because it means inflation pressures are easing. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are hoping that the slowing economy can help keep inflation in control, according to analysts.

The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared to a rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter and a brisk 5.6 percent rate in the first three months of this year.
