British police probing the killings of five prostitutes in Ipswich said they would make an announcement at 2215 GMT on Thursday.

As a legal deadline approached to either charge or release two suspects being held in connection with the enquiry, unconfirmed reports said that police would also hold a news conference.

Two men aged 37 and 48 were being questioned over the murders of five sex workers whose bodies were found in the countryside around the eastern port town over a 10-day period earlier this month, but no-one has yet been charged.

By Friday morning, police must charge or release a man they had arrested on Monday. Police have not named him but media reports have said he is 37-year-old supermarket worker Tom Stephens.

A second man, whom the media named as Steve Wright, 48, of Ipswich in Suffolk county, was also being questioned over the deaths and can be held until Saturday at the latest after being arrested on Tuesday.

Earlier, it emerged that officers working on the case had compared notes with a neighboring force trying to resolve sex worker murders dating back to 1992.

In Norwich, north of Ipswich in the county of Norfolk, mystery still shrouds the stranglings of Natalie Pearman, 16, in 1992, and Michelle Bettles, 22, who died 10 years later. Kellie Pratt, 29, vanished from Norwich's red-light district in 2000.

Inspector Jamie Ayers of Norfolk Police said that the three cases were still open, but that a senior police officer had now been assigned to each one.

"We carry on searching and if there is any help that we can possibly give to Suffolk we will endeavour to do our best," he said.

According to The Sun newspaper, which cited unnamed police sources, Wright was not cooperating fully with the inquiry.

"At the moment Wright isn't playing ball with us. He is exercising his legal right not to answer questions," the source told the tabloid daily.

Police have said the two men were suspected of murdering all five women, whose bodies were found around Ipswich between December 2 and December 12, but have formally declined to name them or say whether they knew each other.

The murdered women are Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29. Adams and Nicol were found in a stream while the other three were found in woodlands.

The cases have triggered comparisons with the "Yorkshire Ripper" Peter Sutcliffe, convicted of the murders of 13 women between 1975 and 1980, and Jack the Ripper, who killed five east London prostitutes in 1888.

Cause of death has only been established in two of the five deaths in Ipswich -- Clennell died of "compression to the neck" and Alderton died from "asphyxiation".

None of the corpses showed signs of having been subjected to significant trauma or serious sexual assault before dying.

Almost 500 officers are working on what has become one of Britain's biggest-ever manhunts, with 350 drafted in from 31 police forces around the country, including Northern Ireland.

As police investigations continued, Britain's Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, warned the country's newspapers and broadcasters to show restraint in reporting the prostitutes' killings.

In particular he urged them to beware of prejudicing a future trial, by refraining from speculation about suspects or material which "asserts or assumes, expressly or implicitly" a person's guilt.
