First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov has ordered the auctioning off of Western-made cars used by Russian government officials, ITAR- TASS news agency reported.

On Friday, Nemtsov instructed Economics Minister Yakov Urinson to draft regulations on selling the cars at auction. He said that the bidding is to be open and covered by the media.

Urinson, who is a deputy prime minister, will also deliver by April 10 guidelines for Russian auto manufactures to submit bids on providing cars for officials.

The order falls in line with a plan forwarded two weeks ago by Nemtsov after he was appointed by President Boris Yeltsin.

On April 1, Yeltsin signed a decree which stops allocations from the federal budget for the buying or leasing of foreign-made cars for government officials.

While the move has enjoyed popular support, Russian press reports say that the plan could backfire as taxpayers are likely to end up paying out more than ever because the only vehicles wanted by top officials will be those customized to their tastes.

The main Russian car, popularly known as the Volga, costs just a third of the price of even a relatively modest German Audi to manufacture.

Add extras, however, such as a foreign air-conditioning system and so on and the car could cost up to 57,000 dollars compared to 22,000 to 28,000 for the typical models favoured by the government.

Press reports also say that Russian-made cars will cost more to maintain because their quality is significantly lower than those made in the West.

Nemtsov, though, has said that the opposite is true and that the exploitation of Russian vehicles is actually lower as they use less fuel and have lower maintenance costs.
