President Bill Clinton said Monday the United States would talk next with the Palestinians about re-starting the Mideast peace process after he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"We had a very specific, frank, candid and long talk," Clinton told reporters following his two-hour meeting at the White House with the Israeli leader.

"It was a long and very thorough meeting ... now it's important for us to visit with the Palestinians," Clinton said, adding he would do his best to get Israeli-Palestinian negotiations back on track.

Clinton declined to give details on the substance of his meeting with Netanyahu.
