A funding shortfall of over 70 percent has forced the World Food Programme (WFP) to halve its rations to hungry Mozambicans, ahead of the critical "lean season" between harvests, when food stocks generally run out, said a report reaching here from the Mozambican capital of Maputo on Friday.

The report said the food aid agency urgently requires 10 million U.S. dollars to feed 460,000 people till next March when another harvest is due.

The WFP currently assists 292,000 vulnerable people, but a 77 percent shortfall in funding has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of half the ration of cereals and corn-soya blend they have been using to fight starvation.

"We are very concerned, because we are not talking about small numbers: some 240,000 people have no food security; half of those people are living in arid areas where they can not farm; they have nothing, " said Paulo Zacula, director of Mozambique's National Disaster agency.

The director said, "we are about to enter a period of emergencies with possible cyclones and floods. We should have stockpiles of food in case of emergencies,"

Karin Manente, WFP acting country director in Mozambique, said, "By this time, we have usually pre-positioned food stocks in areas that become inaccessible during such emergencies."

She added that due to the huge shortfall, some WFP-supported activities might have to be discontinued or suspended this month unless new donations were received, according to the report.
