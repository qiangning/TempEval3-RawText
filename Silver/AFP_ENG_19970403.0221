Japan's Tomen Corp. said Thursday it had bought a 19 percent stake in Koppert Biological Systems BV, a Dutch company that breeds benign insects to protect vegetables against insect pests.

The Japanese trading house has been a sales agent in Japan for the world's biggest breeder of benign insects since 1992 and sold for two years a type of bee that kills insects that thrive on tomatoes and strawberries.

Tomen said its capital tie-up with the Rotterdam-based Koppert would help breed and market types of benign insects peculiar to Japan.

It plans to sell 12 other types of insects to farmers for use in greenhouses.
