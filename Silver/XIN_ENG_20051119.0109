Top seed Roger Federer made an easy through to Sunday's final of the ATP tennis Masters Cup as the Swiss crushed Argentina's Gaston Gaudio here on Saturday without losing a game.

It's the first time back to the 1970s that a year-ending match of world tennis ending up in less than an hour and with a score of 6-0, 6-0.

Federer, holding a 4-0 record against Gaudio and having won his last 13 matches against Argentine opponents before Saturday's match, won on 5 aces, 22 winners and 9 out of 11 net points against 16 unforced errors in the semifinal match less than 50 minutes.

Gaudio, seeded 7th on a rank of ninth in the world for the 4.45 million US dollars season-ending event, cracked just 3 winners throughout the match while making 9 double-faults and 22 unforced errors.

Committing 4 double-faults in a game, Gaudio was broken by the world number one Federer in as early as the second game and his first serve into the match, which set the tune of the match.

Before Saturday's match against Gaudio, the two-time defending champion Federer had kept in low as he was pulled into deciders in his Red Group opener against 12th-ranked David Nalbandian on Sunday and was even forced tiebreaker when facing the world No. 7 Ivan Ljubicic on Tuesday.

But all the embarrassments could not be found on the in Saturday's semis. He proved himself without any weaknesses, especially his backhand which was suspected to be his weaker side and again prolonged his near-perfect record at the Tennis Masters Cup.

Federer has built upon an imposing 16-1 record at the Masters Cup, with his only loss came to Lleyton Hewitt in the Shanghai 2002 semifinals.

It seemed a task impossible for anybody, not just the 26-year-old Gaudio, to win over Federer who has been beaten by no man since June.

With Saturday's victory, Federer reached his third consecutive Tennis Masters Cup final and extended his winning streak to 35 matches, the fifth-longest winning streak in the Open Era and a span that takes in five titles including two grand slam titles.

And the Shanghai match was the first in six weeks for the superlative Swiss, who has already clinched the world No. 1 year-end ranking for the second year in succession. He last competed in Bangkok, winning his 11th title of the season on October 2.

After American veteran Andre Agassi and second seed Rafael Nadal pulled out due to injuries on Monday, Federer, who overcame the effects of the ankle ligament injury scare, has been left the only top-five player in the elite field.
