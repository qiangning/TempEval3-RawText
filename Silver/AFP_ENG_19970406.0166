Two people were killed and two others injured when their car was hit by an avalanche on a main road running through the Russian republic of Northern Ossetia, ITAR-TASS news agency reported Sunday.

Several avalanches have hit the region this weekend following the Spring thaw, local official Boris Degoyev said.

He said traffic has been banned during the day because of the warming temperatures that increase the risk of avalanches.
