NATO has agreed to consider the idea of setting up a contact group, initiated by French President Jacques Chirac, on Afghanistan, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Wednesday.

"I, the secretary general of NATO, has been tasked to think about and put forward proposals for the possibility of a contact group for Afghanistan," de Hoop Scheffer told reporters shortly after the conclusion of the NATO summit.

He said that the contact group would not only be relevant to NATO, but to all the other international organizations active in Afghanistan.

Wrapping a two-day summit which started on Tuesday evening, NATO leaders issued a declaration earlier Wednesday, saying that its door remains open for European countries, and encouraged the accession efforts by Albania, Croatia and Macedonia.

"We reaffirm that NATO remains open to new European members under Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty," said the leaders in their Riga Summit Declaration.

But they emphasized that actual accession will be strictly performance-based.

"At our next summit in 2008, the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet NATO's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security and stability," said the declaration.

NATO's ongoing enlargement process has been an historic success in advancing stability, peace and cooperation in Europe, and the vision of a Europe, which is whole, free, and at peace, it said.

The leaders welcomed the efforts of Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia to prepare themselves for the responsibilities and obligations for membership.

The three Balkan states are recognized by NATO as formal aspirant countries.

On the last day of the two-day summit, leaders of the 26-member bloc also invited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia to join its Partnership for Peace (PfP) program.

The PfP, launched in 1994, is a program of practical bilateral cooperation between individual partner countries and NATO. It allows partner countries to build up an individual relationship with NATO, choosing their own priorities for cooperation. A total of 20 countries have joined the program.
