New Real Madrid coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro told his star-studded squad Friday they must put their trust in him as he takes the helm for the first time in La Liga since succeeding sacked Wanderley Lucemburgo in Malaga on Sunday.

"If the players do not have confidence in me the ship could sink," said Caro as he looked forward to his first test since taking the reins as Real's fifth coach in the last two and a half years.

The Champions League loss to Olympiakos in midweek was academic for his first match of any description in charge with qualification for the last 16 assured but Caro said that with six points to make up on leaders Barcelona everyone has to pull hard in the same direction.

"I am surprised, happy and proud as the players are working exceptionally well," Caro said of his players, adding that "hard work on a daily basis is the recipe for success.

"I have told them there is no doubt they are the best team in the world and that, given time, work and unity we will be a great team."

Caro had Thursday called on Real's fans to get behind the team is they seek to shrug off the mediocre form which saw Luxemburgo shown the door after less than 12 months in one of the hottest seats in the game.
