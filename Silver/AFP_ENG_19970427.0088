The Afghan communist party which came to power 19 years ago in a coup d'etat was condemned for bringing ruin to Afghanistan by the Taliban in a special seminar in Kabul Sunday.

"We don't condemn the 27th of April, but the black incident and shameful catastrophe which was imposed on our people," declared Mullah Abdurrahman Hotaki, a speaker at the Interior Ministry gathering.

On April 27, 1978 Prime Minister Mohammad Doaud was murdered by the communists and their People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) came to power under the leadership of Nur Mohammad Taraki.

The PDPA's so-called Saur (April) Revolution marked the beginning of what they termed a "class struggle" between "feudals and workers" in order to inprove the living conditions of the common Afghan.

Instead due to internal power struggles and badly implemented reforms the PDPA stirred up popular armed uprisings which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by the then Soviet Union in December 1979.

"In order to challenge (the communists), 1.5 million of our people laid down their lives," said Abdurrahman, of the Taliban Shariat weekly newspaper.

He said the advent of communism created a "stain of shame" on the Afghan people which was washed clean by the sacrifice of mujahedeen freedom fighters and their civilian supporters.

After 10 years of occupation the Russians were kicked out of Afghanistan but the PDPA hung on with Soviet support until April 1992 when the former communist president Najibullah was finally overthrown.

"Thanks to the bravery of our people the super-power ran away and their puppets were defeated," said Haji Mullah Khaksar, deputy interior minister.

Unfortunately the gains of this victory against the communists were nullified by the mujahedeen, who fought among themselves for supremacy from April 1992 until September 1996, when the Taliban seized control of Kabul, Khaksar said.

He said due to "despotism and terrorism" under the former mujahedeen the Taliban movement came into being to bring true Islamic law (Shariat) to Afghanistan.
