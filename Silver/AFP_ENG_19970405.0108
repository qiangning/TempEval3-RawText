A false fire alarm went off at a state-run nuclear fuel reprocessing plant northeast of Tokyo Saturday, nearly four weeks after it leaked radioactive substances following a fire and explosion.

The alarm sounded at about noon at a facility for mixing nuclear waste with asphalt at the plant in Tokai Mura, about 115 kilometres (70 miles) from Tokyo, the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen) said.

No smoke or fire was detected as Donen officials checked the facility. There were no signs of a fire on video recordings by surveillance cameras nor was there a rise in the temperature or abnormal radioactive emission.

The cause of the false alarm was being investigated, the officials said.

On March 11, a total of 37 workers were exposed to low-level radiation following the fire and blast at the facility, in what was labeled Japan's worst nuclear accident in terms of people affected.

At the facility, liquid nuclear waste is immobilized by dehydration and mixed with asphalt. The treated substance is then packed into drums.

A press report said the reprocessing plant would remain shut until at least 2001 as Donen needs time to incorporate new reprocessing technology for radioactive waste, the Kyodo news agency said.

The long-term closure of the facility deals a heavy blow to Donen because reprocessing spent nuclear fuel is a major source of income for the state-run company.
