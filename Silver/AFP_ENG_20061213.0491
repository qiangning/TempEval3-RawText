Portuguese first division side Naval have secured the services of Mariano Barreto as their new coach on a 18 month contact, club officials said Wednesday.

Barreto resigned as assistant coach of Russian side Dynamo Moscow on Monday. He will take over from interim coach Fernando Mira who has been in charge of Naval since Rogerio Goncalves left to join Sporting Braga in November.

"I want to work to project Naval to a different level," Barreto told a news conference in the port town of Figueira da Foz where Naval is based.

Barreto's past includes a stint as the coach of Ghana's national team as well as time as an assistant coach of German side Borussia Dortmund and Russian side Lokomotiv Moscow.

Naval lie in 10th place in the 16-team Portuguese premier league with 17 points from 13 matches, 17 points behind leaders FC Porto.
