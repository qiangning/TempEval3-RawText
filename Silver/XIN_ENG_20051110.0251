Harvard-trained Iron Lady Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf appeared to be the first female president in Africa as results from nearly 90 percent of the polling stations on Thursday gave her a commanding advantage over football great George Weah in Liberia's post-war presidential runoff.

The 66-year-old grandmother and former finance minister had 59. 2 percent of the votes while the 39-year-old former FIFA player of the year had 40.8 percent, Frances Johnson-Morris, chairwoman of the National Elections Commission, told a news conference.

The results, she said, are from 2719 of the 3,070 polling stations across the war-torn west African country.
