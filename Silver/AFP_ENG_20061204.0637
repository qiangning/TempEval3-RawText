The Lebanese army intervened to break up clashes in Beirut on Monday evening between government supporters and protestors calling for the government to resign, an AFP journalist witnessed.

The clashes broke out in several Sunni Muslim-majority neighbourhoods near where tens of thousands of people were holding a sit-in protest, overseen by the Shiite Hezbollah militia, to demand the resignation of the Western-backed government.

Soldiers already deployed in the capital went into action after riot police were overwhelmed by protestors who invaded one of the Sunni neighbourhoods in vehicles, prompting residents to retaliate, witnesses and an AFP reporter said.

Calm was restored after an hour of unrest, which followed a day of tension after a Shiite was killed in a street fight on Sunday night.

The exact number of casualities was not known, but the official ANI news agency reported at least two people injured in the Kaskas district, the scene of earlier rioting.
