The Bank of France on Wednesday estimated that fourth quarter gross domestic product will grow by 0.6 percent from the third quarter, unchanged from its previous estimate a month ago.

It foresees GDP for the full year rising by 2.0 percent, also unchanged from its previous estimate. This would be at the low end of the government's forecast range of 2.0-2.5 percent.

In its monthly report, the central bank also said its business climate indicator stood at 106 in November, unchanged from October.

The national statistics institute INSEE said Tuesday that the French economy should expand by 2.1 percent this year, thanks to a rebound in the fourth quarter, and appeared likely to resist a slowdown in global momentum expected in early 2007.

INSEE economist Eric Dubois said the stagnation in the French economy in the third quarter was a surprise and should be corrected by growth of 0.9 percent in the final three months of the year, powered by a pickup in the manufacturing industry.

INSEE in early October predicted French growth in 2006 of 2.3 percent.

In its twice-yearly forecast late last month the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development foresaw growth in France this year of 2.1 percent.
