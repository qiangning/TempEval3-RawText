OPEC members look set to maintain their production quota but have yet to agree on renewing an offer of extra capacity, the cartel's chief said on Saturday ahead of a one-day meeting in Kuwait.

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has a production quota of 28 million barrels per day (bpd), but in September the 11-nation group created a standby two-million bpd allocation to offset hurricane disruption to US output.

Sheikh Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah, Kuwait's energy minister and also current OPEC president, said he and fellow ministers would discuss the matter at the meeting on Monday.

Asked by reporters whether there was a consensus on the 28-million-bpd quota, he said: "I believe that we will continue with our production level."

As for the offer of extra capacity, Sheikh Ahmad said: "From the beginning there are different opinions. For that I cannot decide now, we will have to discuss it in the meetings."

Turning to the crucial issue of demand for energy in the second quarter, which typically wanes in line with a warmer climate in the industrialised northern hemisphere, the OPEC chief indicated that now was not the time to make a decision on how to counter such a slump.

Instead, ministers may meet again next month or in early February.

"In our experience always in the second quarter there is a decrease in demand and I think for that reason some of my colleagues have already made their comments about their worries for the second quarter," said Shiekh Ahmad.

"May be we can have a meeting at the end of January, beginning of February to monitor the market for the second quarter."

Kuwait is hosting the 138th OPEC conference at a hotel in Kuwait City amid tight security.

It is only the second time the oil-rich country has played host to the cartel. The last such meeting here was in 1966.

First to arrive Friday was Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil who voiced support for maintaining the status quo, including the extra capacity pledge.

"The position of Algeria is to continue with the two million barrels per day, we have to work for a stable market," Khelil said.

"We should be able to constantly supply so that the economic growth in the world should be maintained," he added.

United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Mohammad bin Dhaen al-Hamli said in Abu Dhabi on Saturday before leaving for Kuwait that OPEC was likely to extend the standby allocation for another period of three months, the official WAM news agency reported.

The majority of ministers -- including OPEC heavyweights Ali al-Nuaimi, oil minister for Saudi Arabia, and Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh, interim oil minister for Iran -- are not expected in Kuwait until Sunday.

On Friday, Sheikh Ahmad said the meeting was unlikely to decide on the optimal price band mechanism for oil, which hit an all-time high of 70.85 dollars per barrel in New York on August 30 following Hurricane Katrina, which devastated refining and crude production facilities along the US Gulf Coast.

"Maybe we start to discuss the (price band) mechanism ... but there will be no resolution at this meeting," he said.

When asked what he thought was a fair price for oil, he said: "I think it is still between 35 and 55," dollars per barrel.

Hamli for his part put the fair price between 40 and 50 dollars per barrel, said WAM.

Oil prices shot above 61 dollars per barrel for the first time for more than a month in New York trading on Friday before easing to close at 59.39 dollars per barrel on profit-taking.
