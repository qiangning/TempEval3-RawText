India is set to significantly increase its coal imports to match its growing domestic requirement for power generation, a top official said here Monday.

"We started coal imports last year to meet the requirement for power generation. So far this year we have imported around seven million tons of coal, which is set to reach about 14 million tons by March," Indo-Asian News Service quoted Power Secretary R.V. Shahi at the ongoing India Economic Summit 2005 as saying.

"We are preparing to import 20 million tons of high calorific value coal in 2006-07, when we are expecting about 30 million tons shortage," Shahi told the annual summit organized jointly by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

Though one of the world's largest coal producers, India's coal has a high ash content leading to a growing shortfall in production as against the demand, particularly by the power industry.

The current requirement of coal for power sector is about 365- 370 million tons.

The import option is being pushed in addition to the captive coal mining to ensure that shortage does not lead to unutilized power generation capacity, which was witnessed last year.

"This year with 14 million tons of coal imports, as of now we will not be losing generation due to coal shortage," the official said.
