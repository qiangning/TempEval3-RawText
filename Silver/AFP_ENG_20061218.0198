Iraqi Red Crescent aid workers suspended work in war-torn Baghdad on Monday after two dozen of their colleagues fell victim to the latest mass kidnap to shock a city plagued by sectarian violence.

At least 14 Iraqis were killed in a string of bombings and shootings as new US Defence Secretary Robert Gates prepared to take office in Washington amid deepening US divisions about how to handle the worsening crisis in Iraq.

"Only in Baghdad have we stopped, to make more pressure to free those who have been kidnapped," the Iraqi Red Crescent's secretary general Mazen Abdallah told AFP one day after the abductions.

"We are the only organisation working in all Iraq. We don't want to stop," he added, emphasising that the closure applied only to the Red Crescent's health and relief workers in the capital.

In addition to the main branch targeted in the kidnapping, the Iraqi Red Crescent has closed another 40 subsidiary offices in Baghdad, affecting more than 600 staff, a large proportion of them security guards, Abdallah said.

Thirteen of the 30 men snatched in Sunday's brazen raid by gunmen dressed in police uniforms have been released, including three guards from the nearby Dutch embassy and 10 Red Crescent guards and drivers, Abdallah added.

But 17 people, including relief and health workers -- a mixed group of Shiite and Sunni staff -- are still missing following the second mass abduction to terrorise Baghdad in less than a week.

The International Committee of the Red Cross, part of the same movement, has called for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages, and condemned the kidnapping as a breach of international humanitarian law.

Fully aware of the ugly sectarian tensions threatening to rip Iraq apart, Abdallah said he ordered his staff not to reveal their family names while at work, in order not to disclose their religious or ethnic background.

With US experts and politicians increasingly anxious over how to manage the chaos in Iraq, where around 129,000 US troops are clashing with insurgents and training local forces to take over, a new defence secretary was to take office.

Gates, a former Central Intelligence Agency director, will be sworn in at the Pentagon just three days after his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld, blamed for the current mess in Iraq, was given a full honours send-off.

His arrival precedes the announcement of a new policy on Iraq set to be unveiled by US President George W. Bush early next year -- a new strategy that Gates is likely to be involved in shaping.

Options under consideration reportedly include boosting the number of US soldiers by between 20,000 and 50,000 to secure Baghdad, forging an alliance between moderate Iraqi Shiites and Sunnis at the expense of radicals on both sides, or even throwing the US lot in with the majority Shiites.

Bush has effectively dismissed a report by the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel of foreign policy luminaries, which recommended wrapping up US combat operations in the country by early 2008.

Meanwhile, the violence continues unchecked. In Baghdad, five people were killed and 19 wounded when a car bomb exploded in a bustling marketplace in the mixed Shiite-Sunni neighbourhood of Saidiyah, a security source said.

A national electricity employee, a police colonel and a university guard were also killed in separate attacks, security sources said.

Five more civilians were killed in the Baquba area, north of Baghdad, with one attack targeting mourners accompanying bodies to the Shiite religious south for burial, police and medical sources said.

In the northern city of Mosul, unidentified gunmen ambushed and shot dead Khayreddin al-Dabbagh, a member of the municipal council, police said.

The US military also announced that two more troops were killed in action, bringing the number of US fatalities in Iraq since the 2003 invasion to 2,946, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
