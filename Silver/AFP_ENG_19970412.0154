A Hong Kong pro-democracy group on Saturday turned its wrath on Britain, saying it would stage protests at an upcoming visit by ex- premier Margaret Thatcher in anger at British "lip service" on the territory's future.

The announcement was made by the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, a loose alliance of politicians and grass-roots activists opposing the assembly set up by China to legislate in Hong Kong after the July 1 handover.

Thatcher is an architect of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, the treaty that set down the terms for Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule and Beijing's promises to grant it wide-ranging autonomy for the following 50 years.

She is due to make a visit to the territory in two weeks, when she will officiate at the opening of the Tsing Ma Bridge -- part of the project to build Hong Kong's new airport -- on April 27.

"It is obvious that the British Hong Kong government has made too many compromises with communist China to betray democracy and the human rights of Hong Kong people," the United Front said in a statement.

"Recently, the Hong Kong government has taken steps to suppress peaceful demonstration by prosecuting a number of protestors during the selection of the (future) chief executive and the establishment of the Provisional Legislature."

It said the bridge ceremony, and a scheduled fireworks display that will commemorate the opening, "is nothing worthwhile, but an indication of the so-called glory withdrawal of the British government."

The statement called on Governor Chris Patten to withdraw the invitation to Thatcher and added it would organise "various protests" to show "the 'lip service' of British commitment to Hong Kong."

The United Front gathers individuals from Hong Kong's beleaguered pro- democracy faction, including the Frontier group and Democratic Party. Its demonstrations are small but vocal.

Critics of Britain's 156-year rule over Hong Kong say the colonial power moved too late to set down democratic institutions here.

The Legislative Council (LegCo), which will be replaced by the Provisional Legislature, is a fully-elected body.

But only a third of its 60 seats are chosen by universal suffrage. The others are chosen by local councils and by organisations representing Hong Kong's various professions.

In the last LegCo elections, in September 1995, democrats triumphed in the seats chosen by universal but mainly lost in the functional constituencies, which are dominated by pro-China figures.
