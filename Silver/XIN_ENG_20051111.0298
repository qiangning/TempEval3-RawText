The Uruguayan national football team will meet Australia in Montevideo on Saturday, hoping to win the first of two World Cup play-off games and set themselves up for Sydney's return match.

The winner of the two-leg playoff will go through to the 2006 Germany World Cup.

The match takes place in the historic Centenario Stadium, which will be filled with 60,000 Uruguay fans.

The play-offs are being held in a tense atmosphere thanks to statements made by both teams, and also because both countries have met before at this stage.

Uruguay won the ticket to the 2002 World Cup held in Seoul and Tokyo, losing its first game 1-0 but winning the re-match 3-0. That year, a group of violent Uruguayan fans spat on and insulted the Austrian team at Montevideo airport, trying to intimate them on the way to the match.

This year, Australia has asked for security guarantees and has begun its training in Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, so that they can arrive a day before the game.

Uruguay has played in 10 World Cups and won two, while Australia has only taken part in the World Cup once, in Germany in 1974.

Australia made the play-offs for the last three World Cups, but was beaten each time, by Argentina in 1994, by Iran in 1998 and last time by Uruguay.

Uruguay will take on an offensive strategy with three forwards: Marcelo Zalayeta of Italy's Juventus, Richard Morales of Spanish league team Malaga and either Forlan or Silva as the third.

Australia is expected to exploit a conservative strategy with only one forward Mark Viduka of English league team Middlesborough.
