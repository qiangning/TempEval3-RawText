Israeli warplanes attacked a suspected Hezbollah target in south Lebanon on Tuesday, local newspaper Ha'aretz reported.

Witnesses were quoted as saying that the Israeli jets fired rockets at the post near the border village of Abayseh, just north of the Lebanon-Israel border.

There was no immediate word on casualties.

The air strikes broke a tense calm along the Israel-Lebanon border on Tuesday, after the Hezbollah attacks sent Israelis to bomb shelters across the north on Monday.

At least four Hezbollah gunmen were killed on Monday trying to kidnap soldiers from outposts of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on the Lebanese border, and seven Israeli soldiers and four civilians were wounded in the series of clashes.

This was considered the broadest Hezbollah attacks since Israeli army withdrew from south Lebanon more than five years ago.

Hours before the Tuesday air strike, IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz said that Israel has a " very diverse basket" of military means at the ready.

"We are ready with a basket of operations. The basket of means in our hands is very diverse, and we will know how to use it with judgment," Halutz said.

As an armed group in Lebanon, Hezbollah played an important role in fighting Israel, which ended its 22 years of occupation in south Lebanon in May 2000.

Defying a UN Security Council resolution in September 2004 to disarm, the pro-Iranian group vowed to keep fighting Israel and defending Lebanon.
