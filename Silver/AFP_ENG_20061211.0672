Four people including a three-year-old child were found dead, apparently stabbed, in northern Italy on Monday night by firefighters called to a burning apartment building, ANSA news agency reported.

Firefighters found the bodies of three women and the child, some of them bearing what may have been knife wounds, inside the flaming building in Erba, near Lake Como north of the city of Milan, the agency said.

An injured man was also found at the scene and was taken to hospital.
