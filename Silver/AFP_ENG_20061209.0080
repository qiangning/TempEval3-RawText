Double world champion Nicol David is eyeing revenge over Hong Kong's Rebecca Chiu as she attempts to reclaim the Asian Games squash crown she lost in such miserable circumstances four years ago.

The Malaysian won the title as a 15-year-old in Bangkok in 1998 but crashed to a demoralising defeat in Busan in 2002 when the weight of expectation proved too much.

Now, with another world title under her belt and with her place at the top of the world rankings confirmed by having twice as many points as her closest rival, the 23-year-old insists she is ready to take back her Asian crown.

"The Asian Games is very important to me, in a different way from the World Open," said David who saw off Australia's three-times Commonwealth Games gold medallist Natalie Grinham to retain her world title in Belfast last month.

David, who is seeded to face Chiu again in the final here, defeated the Hong Kong girl to win the gold at the Bangkok Games in 1998.

"At the Asian Games, you are part of your country's whole team of athletes from a number of different sports. There's been a huge build-up to the Games and winning something like this is a whole different feeling," said the woman from Penang.

David is in a rich vein of form with her win in Belfast stretching her unbeaten international run to 33 matches.

After a bye in the first round, she is expected to go on to face Hong Kong's Christina Mak in the semi-finals, before the anticipated final clash with Chiu.

Victory here will also see her bank account boosted by a 25,000-dollar bonus from the Malaysian National Sports Council. Her first world title in 2005 earned her 56,000 dollars

In the men's event, David's compatriot Mohd Azlan Iskandar is the top seed.

His only previous performance in the Games was a semi-final finish four years ago.

Azlan Iskander is seeded to meet compatriot and defending champion On Beng Hee, the defending champion, in the final.

The pair will face stiff competition, however, from Pakistan's Mansoor Zaman and Aamir Atlas Khan, and Indian duo Ritwik Bhattacharya and the Saurav Ghosal.

Azlan Iskander, the world number 14, is the highest ranked player in Asia but recent form has not been encouraging.

He lost to qualifier Alister Walker of England at the Hong Kong Open and then was beaten by unseeded Pakistani Aamir Atlas Khan in the first round of the Pakistan Open on the eve of the Games.

The Malaysian said he will be under pressure when the tournament starts on Sunday.

"Losing twice to players ranked well below me was a setback," said the Malaysian.

"I need to brush up on my technique and tactics quickly to live up to my billing as the number one player in Asia," said Azlan who was a bronze medallist in Busan.

Defending champion Ong Beng Hee, who beat Mansoor Zaman four years ago, believes the Pakistanis, once the kings of the sport, will again pose a threat.

"They will definitely try to stop me and Iskander from reaching the final," said Beng Hee.

"It will be really nice to have all-Malaysian finals in both the men's and women's events."
