Unidentified attackers exploded a device in a supermarket in central Addis Ababa on Monday, the third such attack in the Ethiopian capital in three days, witnesses said.

An unspecified number of injured were taken to hospital as police cordoned off the area following the blast in the large Le Tana supermarket which went off at around 5:00 p.m. (1400 GMT).

It was not immediately known if there were any deaths.

On Saturday, an Ethiopian barmaid was killed and 42 other people injured, including four Britons and two French nationals, when attackers threw grenades into two restaurants.

Those attacks have not yet been claimed.

In January last year, three people were killed and some 20 others injured when a bomb exploded in the capital's luxury Ghion hotel.

That attack was claimed by Al-Itihad Al-Islam, a group of ethnic Somalis fighting for the independence of Ethiopia's southeastern Ogaden region.
