Russian prosecutors have opened a corruption probe against a former commander-in-chief of the army, the Interfax agency reported Tuesday.

They want to know how General Vladimir Semionov built himself a lavish villa on the outskirts of Moscow, the agency said, quoting the prosecutors.

The general was sacked in December at the request of Defence Minister Igor Rodionov for "activities incompatible with his office and bringing the honour and dignity of the military into disrepute".

Semionov is suspected of "abuse of power." Semionov, who had been army chief since 1991, refuted the allegations against him.

Rodionov said last month that a number of other Russian armed forces generals were likely to be dismissed soon for corruption, without naming any of them.
