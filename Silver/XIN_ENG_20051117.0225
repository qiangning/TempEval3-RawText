Russian Health and Social Development Minister Mikhail Zurabov on Thursday denied reports of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the country.

"I don't have any information about the mass contagion of bird flu in the Ulyanovsk region," Zurabov was quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency as saying.

"The data I have lead me to assume this information is somewhat distorted," the minister said.

Isolated instances of humans contracting bird flu have been registered worldwide. They all involved the spread of the virus from birds to humans, not from humans to humans, Zurabov said.

The world community is racing to prevent a bird flu pandemic by various means, including vaccination, he added.

So far, eight Russian regions have been affected by bird flu since its outbreak in July. The virus, strains of which can spread to humans and can be fatal, has claimed the lives of more than 60 people in Southeast Asia since 2003.
