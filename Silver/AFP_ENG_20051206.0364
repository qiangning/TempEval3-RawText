The Italian government on Tuesday rejected the budget for the enlarged European Union presented by the bloc's British presidency.

"The Italian government has a negative opinion on the entire proposal," Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini told the Italian Senate.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, informed late Monday by his British counterpart Tony Blair of the broad outlines of the proposal, had "reserved his judgement."

But Italian diplomats said the initial response had been negative.

Proposed spending reductions would "derail the process of integrating the 10 new member states and raise the Italian contribution."

In the run-up to a December 15-16 summit in Brussels, the British EU presidency is proposing seven to eight percent less in funding for the mainly ex-communist states that joined the bloc in May 2004.
