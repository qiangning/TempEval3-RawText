Newcastle United's Nigerian defender Celestine Babayaro was banned for three games on Wednesday for a brawl with Everton's Australian midfielder Tim Cahill.

Both players were charged with the same offence on Wednesday and given until 1800 GMT to respond by the Football Association. Babayaro admitted the charge shortly afterwards.

The cases were due to be heard by a disciplinary commission on Thursday.

The pair appeared to lash out after tangling in Everton's 1-0 Premier League victory at Goodison Park on Sunday. Referee Howard Webb, who had not initially seen the entire incident, did not book either player.
