Underdog Japan stunned Asian champion China 68-60 to reach the men's basketball final at the East Asian Games here on Saturday.

Japan, who suffered a 78-62 loss to South Korea Friday, played a completely different game, leading from the very beginning and enlarging the gap by every quarter on the way.

Japan's coach Zeljko Pavlicevic said they deserved the win as they played better than the Chinese in both defense and offense.

"We played a great game," said Zeljko. "We led from the beginning and never looked back. It wasn't a final-ball game and we won it by eight points."

"You see the scoreboard, we are good in almost every thing, points, assists, rebounds and steals, we did play a great game."

Leading the first quarter 17-14, Japan ran away 35-27 at the half break thanks to point guard Igarashi Kei, who scored eight points in a row in the second quarter.

Japan widened its advantage to close the third quarter 54-43 after China's inside dominance Yi Jianlian was benched with four fouls in hand.

China, who had the semifinals without a loss, fought hard to close the margin to five points in the fourth quarter but Japanese forward Amino Tomoo's two shots ended China's comeback dream.

Igarashi led the Japanese side with 19 points, seven assists, three steals and forward Amino added 16 points and seven rebounds.

Yi, who averaged more than 20 points in the preliminary round, scored a team high of 14 points yet only pulled down four rebounds. Guards Lu Xiaoming and Wang Shipeng each added 10 points.

In Saturday's another semifinal, Chinese Taipei nipped South Korea 61-48 thanks to a solid defense that limited its rival's shooting percentage to a poor 22 percent.

Chinese Taipei out-scored the South Korean side 14-6 in the fourth quarter to seal a final berth.

Guard Zeng Wending scored a team high of 22 points and grabbed nine rebounds for Chinese Taipei, while forward Tianlei added 16 points and 14 rebounds.

Guard Park Ji Hyon led South Korea with 20 points, forward Jung Hoon added 11 points.

"It's surprising that Japan upset China today, but we are glad to have Japan as the final rival," said Chinese Taipei coach Jin Hyo Joon.

Chinese Taipei, who beat Japan 89-78 in the preliminary round, will play the final on Sunday, while South Korea plays against China for the bronze.
