The four-day Abuja carnival has ended in pomp and ceremony with colorful parade, fireworks and musical display, News Agency of Nigeria reported on Monday.

On behalf of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister Malam Nasiru el-Rufai declared the closing of the carnival at the weekend in Abuja.

Describing the carnival as a huge success, the chairman of the organizing committee Olusegun Runsewe hoped that next year's carnival would be bigger and would afford Nigeria another opportunity to present its culture and tradition to the world.

Awards were given to all states that participated at the carnival while Kaduna State with the largest contingent of 500 got a special award as well as the best durbar award.

Some of the participants called on the government to work in collaboration with the private sector for a better carnival next year.

This year's carnival, started from Nov. 23-26, was aimed at repositioning the country in the world tourism map.
