Angola spruced up its battered capital for the inauguration Friday of a new government to heal the wounds after 19 years of civil war which devastated the oil-rich country.

South African leader Nelson Mandela headed for Luanda to join 30 other heads of state at the long-delayed inauguration, but former rebel leader Jonas Savimbi stayed away, citing security reasons.

Friday's ceremony follows a vote early this week approving the special status of Savimbi, the leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and recognising him as leader of the country's main opposition party.

That removed the last major obstacle to installing the government of national unity and reconciliation as provided for by the 1994 Lusaka peace accords and including 11 UNITA members.

Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana announced on Wednesday that the South African president would be in attendance on Friday which has been declared a national holiday in Angola.

Luanda, meanwhile, rushed to tidy up its neglected and overpopulated capital, and deployed a hefty contingent of anti-riot forces.

UNITA representative in Abidjan John Marques Kakumba said Savimbi -- who has not appeared in Luanda since 1992 when his party lost elections and civil war resumed -- would not be attending the inauguration.

"Mr. Savimbi will not be in Luanda on Friday. He will not take part," Kakumba said, adding that the former rebel leader was currently in Bailundo, his stronghold in central Angola.

Speaking after a telephone conversation with Savimbi, Kakumba said the UNITA leader had been surprised to see his name listed on the official programme.

For Kakumba, the programme was a "falsehood" and the government was "fully aware" that Savimbi would not travel to Angola.

UNITA considers "conditions are not in place for him to travel to Luanda in the immediate future," he said, although he continued: "reconciliation is well underway, lets say 99.9 percent."

Deputies of the former rebel UNITA movement took up their seats in parliament Wednesday, a day after the assembly approved special status for Savimbi and five years after their election in a vote carried by the ruling Angolan People's Liberation Movement (MPLA).

Also on Wednesday, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos appointed outgoing premier Fernando de Franca Van-Dunem as head of Angola's new government and on Thursday named the other members of the 84-member government.

Following the 1994 peace accords which ended the war which pitted UNITA against the MPLA, the formation of a national reconciliation government had been initially scheduled for January 25, but was indefinitely delayed as UNITA then argued there were still outstanding problems.

Despite signs of ongoing distrust, the remaining difficulties were ostensibly swept away by Tuesday's vote which gave Savimbi the right to regular consultations with the president and members of the government and the right to publish messages in the official press.

Several deputies from the ruling MPLA have criticised the "excessive powers" granted to Savimbi although they followed the party's advice to approve the law.

A UN source said the situation would only fully return to normal after the next general elections are held in two or three years time.

Political commentators in Luanda further stressed that UNITA's return to political life would not be a miracle solution to the problems of a country devastated by a war which caused some 500,000 deaths, thousands of injuries, and ruined its industry and agriculture.

However, it could accelerate the implementation of other terms of the peace accords, such as the formation of a new 90,000-strong army, including 23,600 from UNITA and the demobilisation of some 100,000 troops.
