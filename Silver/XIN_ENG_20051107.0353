Nearly half of Vietnam's urban population currently have no or little access to water supply, according to the Water Resources Management Department under the country's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.

Total capacity of water plants in urban areas can supply urban residents with nearly 150 liters per head a day, but they only receive around 50 liters, partly due to scarcity of water input and losses of water supply, the department said Tuesday.

The fact that waterfalls and river flow distribute unequally in Vietnam, and that two-thirds of the country's water flows in from outside its territory are major causes for droughts.

Water shortage in dry seasons is also a factor. The country has average annual rainfall of 1,690 millimeters, a high level in the world, but only 10-30 percent is in the dry season lasting 7-8 months, the department noted.

Water supply losses of 240 water plants with combined daily design capacity of more than 3.2 million cubic meters stood at 35 percent in late 2004, down from 40 percent in 2002. Over 75 percent of populations of major cities accessed running water at that time.

Vietnam has aimed to establish water supply systems in all cities and towns nationwide by 2010. The country has also planned to supply safe water to 85 percent of its rural population by that year.

As of early this year, Vietnam had a population of some 82.1 million, with 26 percent residing in urban areas.
