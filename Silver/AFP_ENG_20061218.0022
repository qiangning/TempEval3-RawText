US-led coalition and Afghan troops killed four Taliban militants and arrested 10 suspected "terrorists" in separate raids in insurgency-hit Afghanistan, the US military said Monday.

The forces "seized an enemy weapons cache containing mines and explosives" in an operation near Sperwan Ghar in the troubled southern province of Kandahar, it said in a statement.

During the raid late on Sunday "four insurgents were killed and three coalition force soldiers wounded", it said.

"A coalition air strike and indirect fire supported the operation," it said, adding that there were no military or civilian deaths.

Coalition troops backed by Afghan army soldiers also detained 10 "suspected terrorists" including an Al-Qaeda-linked militant in the eastern province of Kunar early Monday, the coalition said in another statement.

"The operation resulted in the capture of a known transporter of weapons and explosives who is linked to foreign fighter movements in the region," it said.

The man, whose name and nationality were not disclosed, was also responsible for facilitating suicide bombings which have increased in Afghanistan in recent months, the statement said.

The militant was "responsible for facilitating suicide and improvised explosive device attacks against the Afghan population, Afghan national security forces, and coalition forces," it said.

"Credible information led the combined force to believe the transporter and his associates were at the compound," which the rebels shared with women and children, it said.

There were no civilian casualties during the raid, it said.

The Taliban, whose regime was toppled in a US-led invasion five years ago, have dramatically stepped up insurgent attacks on foreign and Afghan security forces.

Some 4,000 people, many of them militants but also troops and civilians, have died in Taliban-led violence this year alone, making it Afghanistan's bloodiest year since 2001.
