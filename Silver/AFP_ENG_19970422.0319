Japan's lower house adopted a resolution Tuesday calling on the government to make "its utmost effort" to slash US military bases in Okinawa.

The vote comes three days before the summit between Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President Bill Clinton in Washington.

It was the first Diet resolution on Okinawa US military bases since parliament passed a similar resolution in 1971 when Japan and the United States signed an accord on the return of the southern island.

"The House of Representatives will urge the government to make its utmost effort to consolidate, realign, reduce and relocate the US military bases in Okinawa," the resolution said.

The resolution asked the government to consult with the United States on military postures, including the structure of the US military force in the Asia-Pacific region.

It also urged the government to take "comprehensive and effective" measures to boost the Okinawa economy.

Last week, the Japanse parliament passed legislation allowing the US military to keep using land in Okinawa amid protest from landowners and their supporters.

Okinawa has been a major headache for successive governments following the rape of a 12-year-old girl by three American servicemen in 1995. The rape triggered outrage among locals and prompted the prefectural governor, Masahide Ota, to seek the complete withdrawal of American troops by 2015.

The southern island prefecture is home to more than half of the 47,000 American troops in Japan and also accounts for about 75 percent of US military facilities on the entire archipelago.
