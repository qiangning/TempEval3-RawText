Ten Vietnamese men have been arrested in southern China while trying to sneak into Hong Kong to look for jobs, it was reported Thursday.

The 10 Vietnamese, aged between 20 and 40, were held in coastal Wuchuan city in Guangdong province, while preparing to sail to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong branch of China News Service said.

They told Chinese authorities that they paid 10 billion dong (800 US dollars) to human smugglers to take them to Hong Kong where they were promised work, the report said.

The Vietnamese illegal immigrant left Nan Dinh in north Vietnam for Hong Kong on April 12.
