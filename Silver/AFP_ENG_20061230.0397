California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was released from the hospital here Saturday, following successful surgery on his right leg to fix a broken bone.

The Hollywood action-hero-turned-politician fractured his right femur on December 23 while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, and underwent a 90-minute operation on December 26 to knit the broken bones back together.

"His femur is beginning to mend nicely and I expect him to have a full and speedy recovery from this injury," Doctor Kevin Ehrhart, Schwarzenegger's orthopedic surgeon, said in a statement Saturday.

He added that fractures of that kind usually take about eight weeks to completely heal.

Schwarzenegger said in a statement that he felt "fantastic to return home today as my family prepares to celebrate the New Year together."

He said he was looking forward to beginning 2007 with his formal inauguration, his State of the State Address, and the presentation of a state budget proposal.
