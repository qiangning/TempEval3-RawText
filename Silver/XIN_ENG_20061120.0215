U.S. stocks traded higher on Monday, after U.S. leading indicators of economic activity increased 0.2 percent in October.

In the midday trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.70, to 12,346.26. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 2.19 to 1,403.39, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 7.44 to 2,453.30.

The Conference Board said Monday that leading indicators of the U.S. economic activity increased 0.2 percent in October, suggesting slow growth will continue through the winter and into the spring.

"The impact of a slower housing market on consumers and slower profit growth on business isn't completely offset by lower gas prices and a rising stock market," said Ken Goldstein, labor economist at the Conference Board.
