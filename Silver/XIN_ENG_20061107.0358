Japan's national beach soccer team became the second Group A team to qualify for the quarter-finals of the sport's World Cup, held on Copacabana beach in Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro, though the team lost 5-8 to Poland on Tuesday.

Japan, the United States and Poland are equal on points, each with one win and two losses. Japan scraped through on goal-difference.

Japan, which qualified as second in Group A, will play France, the top team of Group B, in a repeat of one of the sport's semi-final matches, which was held on the same beach in 2005.
