Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Donald Tsang will lead a delegation, comprising officials and local business leaders, to visit southwestern Guizhou on Nov. 21, a government spokesman said Wednesday.

The three-day tour aims to promote economic and trade cooperation between Hong Kong and the Pan-Pearl River Delta region, which groups Hong Kong, Macao, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hainan, Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan.

The tour will be Tsang's third visit to the Pan-Pearl River region since he assumed the office of HKSAR Chief Executive in 2005. He will lead another business delegation to Jiangxi early next year, according to the government spokesman.

During the trip, Tsang will visit local enterprises and tourism-related infrastructure. He will also take part in the Hong Kong-Guizhou Business Co-operation Symposium and the Hong Kong-Guizhou Tourism Seminar.
