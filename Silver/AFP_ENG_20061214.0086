China has overtaken Japan as luxury car maker Rolls-Royce's largest Asian market, the legendary marque's chairman and chief executive Ian Robertson revealed Thursday.

The fast-emerging economic giant last year saw sales of the super-luxury Rolls-Royce Phantom soar 60 percent to 70 units.

"That sort of growth is unique it's very special -- usually 5 percent either way means the difference between a great year and a not so great year in other markets," said Robertson, in Hong Kong for the unveiling of the Peninsula Hotel's new fleet of 14 Phantoms.

The United States remains the company's biggest market, with the majority of sales there made in Los Angeles, where the brand has three dealerships.

Britain is the second largest market, with China now third.

Such is the pace of growth amongst Chinese buyers that the company is to expand its four dealerships in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to seven with addition next year of offices in Hangzhou, Shenzgen and Chengdu.

Rolls Royce launched the Phantom in 2003, its first model since the former British company was acquired by German auto manufacturer BMW in 1998.

The company hopes to sell 600 of the made-to-measure cars in 2006, setting a 16-year production record, and will launch its long-awaited, yet-to-be-named convertible version in January 2007.
