Thousands of people protested Saturday in the Croatian coastal town of Zadar to express their anger over the jailing of war crimes suspect Ante Gotovina at the UN court at The Hague.

The protests came after a night of unrest in which police made more than a dozen arrests and angry demonstrators set fire to cars and displayed the insignia of Croatia's World War II pro-Nazi Ustasha regime.

The 50-year-old former general was arrested in Spain on Wednesday after four years on the run. He was detained at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague on Saturday pending the start of his trial.

Gotovina, who was born near Zadar, is considered a hero by many in Croatia for repelling Serb forces toward the end of the country's 1991-1995 inter-ethnic war of independence from Yugoslavia.

"We demand the government provide general Gotovina and his lawyers all documents (needed for his defence). We also demand that general Gotovina be tried in his country," protest organizer Ante Martinac told a crowd waving Croatian flags and portraits of Gotovina in Zadar's central square.

Gotovina has been presented with the keys to the city and until recently his portrait hung over the main gate in its medieval walls.

More protests are expected Sunday after a veterans' association called a demonstration in the southern coastal town of Split, saying some 100,000 people would attend.

An association of some 20 mostly retired generals has backed the gathering.

"We call all Croatian patriots, all honest Croatians, to be in Split tomorrow at noon to voice support to Gotovina," retired general Ljubo Cesic-Rojs told journalists.

Another retired general, Markica Rebic, stressed however that the protests should not be hijacked by "extremists".

"We want to condemn in advance any attempt to use tomorrow's gathering for any extremist or political goals," he said.

On Friday some 200 high-school pupils chanted insults against the authorities in a protest in Zadar. Some had the insignia of Croatia's World War II Ustasha fascist regime, sang Ustasha songs and used the Nazi salute.

They also burned the flag of the European Union, which had held up talks on Croatia's membership due to Zagreb's failure to arrest the fugitive.

Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said he understood that Gotovina's arrest was an emotional issue but called for people to "show common sense and trust the government".

Gotovina is accused of failing to prevent the massacre of about 150 ethnic Serb civilians during a Croatian offensive to retake the rebel-held Krajina region in August 1995.

The indictment says his troops went on a rampage of looting and destruction in Serb-held areas. The war claimed 20,000 lives with rebel Serbs occupying one-third of the country at one stage.

Pro-Gotovina rallies were also announced for Sunday in neighboring Bosnia, in areas with a majority ethnic Croat population.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministry said that Gotovina asked local media not to disturb his family.
