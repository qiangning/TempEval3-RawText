Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Wednesday evening that his country is facing dual threats of physical and moral from Iran, Israeli daily Haaretz reported.

"Israel's main problem is threat that comes from those who openly talk about wiping us off the map," Olmert was quoted as saying in Orthodox Union convention in Jerusalem.

Not only the physical one, the moral threat from Iran also plagued Israel, the prime minister added.

He vowed to react to those threats imposed on Israel, saying that "We have heard these voices in the past. We can't afford to listen and not to react."

He also urged the world to take seriously the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program.

There are considerable speculations about the possibility that Israel might attack Iranian nuclear facilities if Iran insists on developing its nuclear program.

On Monday, Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) reported that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Israel would not attack the Islamic Republic as "its regime is weak and it has many problems."

Ahmadinejad reiterated that Iran's nuclear plan is solely peaceful, saying "Iran is peace loving country and has never attacked another country."
