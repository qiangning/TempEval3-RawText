The World Cup draw threw up some enticing encounters for Asia-Pacific nations, with newcomers Australia and Asian champions Japan drawn in the same group as holders Brazil.

South Korea, semi-finalists four years ago, have an easier ride, in a group that pits them against Switzerland and Togo but also 1998 winners France.

Saudi Arabia will play perennial underachievers Spain, and also Ukraine and African champions Tunisia while Asia's other representative, Iran, has its work cut out against seeded side Mexico, Portugal and debutants Angola.

Japan and Australia, who also play Croatia, begin Group F action with a clash against each other in Kaiserslautern on June 12, but it is the prospect of meeting five-time champions Brazil that has mouths watering in Asia.

"Perhaps Japan and Croatia have other ideas, but realistically we are looking for the spot behind Brazil," said Australia's coach Guus Hiddink, who has helped spark huge interest in football in Australia.

"They are the favourites and the toughest draw we could have had," added the Dutchman, who steered South Korea to the last four in 2000.

Australia are competing at their first World Cup finals since 1974.

Japan, recently voted Asia's team of the year by the Asian Football Confederation, are more of an unknown entity for Hiddink, but he is not underestimating them.

"Japan have changed a lot since 2002 and, like us, they will want to pull something out of the hat," he said. "We are happy to have qualified, but we are not here to make up the numbers and want to spring a surprise."

For Japan's Brazilian coach Zico, who took over from Frenchman Philippe Troussier after the 2002 World Cup, being drawn against his home country is a dream come true, and he is ready for the challenge.

"A team that has qualified for the World Cup finals must be prepared for any situation whatsoever," Zico, who played for Brazil at three World Cups, told Japanese television in Leipzig after the draw there.

"For us, it is easier to encounter Brazil in the first round. It is better than fighting them after winning through to the second round."

While Brazil are the number one threat, Zico is aware that Australia under Hiddink are dangerous and shouldn't be underestimated.

"They are well guided. It will be very important for us to win the first match and boost the morale of my players," he said.

Australia play Brazil at Nuremburg on June 18 while Japan will lock horns with them in Dortmund on June 22.

South Korea, led by Manchester United star Park Ji-Sung, will fancy their chances in Group G, opening their World Cup against first-timers Togo in Frankfurt on June 13.

While playing down the prospect of another semi-final success, coach Dick Advocaat said his team would be difficult to beat, but acknowledged France were favourites to top the group.

"We have three tough games but the way we are playing we are very difficult to beat at the moment. We have a very young team but it is maturing," he said. "France are slight favourites on paper."

Three-time Asian champions Iran have a tough draw, with manager Branko Ivankovic admitting it will be hard to overcome Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal and Mexico in Group D.

"Our problem will be in adapting to the different styles -- European, African and Latin-American. I hope our players will learn how to respond to the different problems," said the Croatian.

In Group H, Saudi Arabia, in their fourth consecutive World Cup, will need to be at their best to beat Ukraine, the first European nation to qualify for Germany, and Africa's top country Tunisia.

Saudi Arabia suffered a humiliating 8-0 defeat to eventual runners-up Germany in their opener of the 2002 World Cup in Japan, and will be looking to avoid a similar disaster at all costs.

The World Cup finals get underway in Munich on June 9 when hosts Germany meet Costa Rica.
