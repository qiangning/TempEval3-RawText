Construction of the Kunzvi Dam is the panacea to the water problems plaguing Harare and its dormitory towns, Zimbabwean Water Resources and Infrastructure Development Minster Munacho Mutezo said on Monday.

"Harare has been facing a major water shortage and implementation of Kunzvi Dam is the solution," he said this while addressing a Chinese delegation from Jiangxi Province which is on a five-day visit to the country to explore areas of possible cooperation.

"We hope the project will be able to work shortly so that the people in Harare and surrounding areas do not have to suffer."

Mutezo said time was ripe for implementation of the project, which had been on the cards for the past eight years.

Suburbs in Harare have been going for weeks without water supplies with satellite towns such as Chitungwiza going for more than two months without supplies.

While aging water infrastructure has been singled out as a major contributor to the woes, declining water levels in major supply dams have been cited as contributory to the problem.

According to Mutezo, the contractors had completed projects such as the Valley Dam and Irrigation scheme in Kezi district, Masvingo Rural, Runde and Mawere water schemes.

And the Marowa Nyathi Dam in Manicaland was being implemented, he said.
