The first face-to-face peace talks between Zaire's warring parties officially opened here Saturday, chaired by the United Nations and South Africa, UN envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said.

Sahnoun told journalists and diplomats at the state Union Buildings here that Zaire's government delegation, led by Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda and special envoy Honore Ngbanda Nzambo, made opening speeches along with the rebels, led by Bizimana Karaha.

South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad was present at the ceremony, which is the first face-to-face meeting between the two sides since rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila launched an insurgency aimed at toppling long-time Zairean ruler President Mobutu Sese Seko.

Sahnoun is also the representative of the Organisation of African Unity.
