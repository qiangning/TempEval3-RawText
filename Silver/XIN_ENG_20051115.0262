About 1,500 people living on the slopes of a volcano in southwest Colombia were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday as it has shown signs of an imminent eruption.

Local authorities on Monday issued a mandatory evacuation order following a warning issued by Colombia's Geology and Mines Institute that the Galeras volcano, which lies 540 km southwest of Bogota, is probable to erupt "within days or weeks."

In addition, another 7,500 people living near the volcano have been asked to leave their homes voluntarily.

The last eruption of the volcano, which occurred in 1993, killed nine people, including five scientists who had descended into the crater to sample gases at the moment it blew.
