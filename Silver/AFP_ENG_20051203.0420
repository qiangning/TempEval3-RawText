Africa's woes from wars to fairer trade, illegal immigration to a brain drain, come under the spotlight at a second and final day of a summit of African and French leaders here on Sunday.

French President Jacques Chirac and, for the first time at an Africa-France Summit, representatives of all 53 African states, including more than 20 heads of state, have gathered in the Malian capital, Bamako.

With crunch global trade talks looming in Hong Kong, the need to ensure a better deal for poor African nations in world trade was one of the themes to focus leaders' minds here on the opening day.

"African farmers must receive a fair reward for their work. We cannot accept a situation in which hasty and generalised liberalisation of agricultural trade ruins the efforts of the least developed nations," Chirac said.

Ministers of the 148 World Trade Organisation members head to Hong Kong from December 13 to take stock of the 'Doha Development' round of negotiations, launched in the Qatari capital in 2001.

The talks have largely stalled over the degree to which rich countries offer financial support to their agriculture sectors.

Mali President Amadou Toumani Toure said cotton was "symbolic of inequitable trade". "Are we going to continue in Africa sowing cotton to harvest deficits, while others, more affluent, sow the same cotton to harvest subsidies?" Toure said.

West African governments want the WTO meeting to fix a date to eliminate all cotton subsidies, which they say price their top export earner out of world markets.

The crisis in France's former colony of Ivory Coast, divided since fighting broke out in 2002 pitting President Laurent Gbagbo against rebels who control the north, is another source of concern.

Chirac said, during talks with the leaders of South Africa and Niger here, that France, which has 4,000 troops deployed in Ivory Coast, wanted a new prime minister appointed in Ivory Coast soon, a French delegation source said.

Ivorian political and rebel parties have been unable to agree on who should head an interim government.

Summiteers have also addressed how to tackle immigration and the alleviation of poverty to keep Africans, tempted to seek better living conditions elsewhere, at home.

"Together, we must encourage co-development and enable Africans to enjoy decent conditions for living and working in their own countries," Chirac, 73, said.

The Bamako summit is the first time he has travelled outside of Europe since his week-long hospitalisation in September for a vision problem that doctors said was caused by a minor vascular "incident".
