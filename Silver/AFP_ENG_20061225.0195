Queen Elizabeth II on Monday called for the bridging of the generation gap between young and old when she delivered her annual Christmas message to Britain and the Commonwealth.

In a pre-recorded speech, which was broadcast on television and radio and for the first time this year as a podcast, the queen, 80, spoke of how parents, grandparents, the wider family and community all help children grow up.

But, she said, modern life was loosening familial ties and the traditional bonds between the generations.

"The pressures of modern life sometimes seem to be weakening the links which have traditionally kept us together as families and communities," she said.

"As children grow up and develop their own sense of confidence and independence in the ever-changing technological environment, there is always the danger of a real divide opening up between young and old, based on unfamiliarity, ignorance and misunderstanding."

The broadcast Christmas speech -- a tradition started by her grandfather king George V in 1932 -- was recorded this year at Southwark Cathedral on the south bank of the River Thames in London.

It included a montage of some of her many engagements this year and again had a strong religious theme, with footage showing people of all faiths in worship.

It included images of men praying at London Central Mosque, scenes from the opening of Europe's largest Hindu temple in the English West Midlands, and a Jewish reception involving the country's chief rabbi.

Wearing a spring green outfit, the queen -- who has seven grandchildren by her four children -- is also seen talking to schoolchildren as she helps them make a collage of a Christian nativity scene.

The queen, who is head of the Church of England, said all faiths encouraged the bridging of the age divide and had in common the need to help the young become "considerate and active citizens".

As older people lived longer, the monarch said the opportunities had increased to bring old and young together.

Older people could bring an invaluable "sense of context" and the "wisdom of experience" to the energy and ambitions of the young.

"Such advice and comfort are probably needed more often than younger people admit or older people recognise," she said.

The queen's speech came a day after she praised the courage and commitment of her armed forces, particularly those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, in a separate, recorded Christmas greeting.

Monday's broadcast came at the same time as a Muslim woman in a full-face veil delivered an alternative Christmas message on Britain's Channel 4 television.

The woman, known only as Khadijah said she felt more "liberated" since she began covering her face with the niqab 10 years ago and people should be more tolerant.

Channel 4's decision to air the broadcast came in for strong criticism, particularly in the right-wing press, at a time of fierce debate about the extent of ethnic and religious integration in modern Britain.

But like the queen, Khadijah -- who said she was the great-granddaughter of a suffragette who fought for British women's right to vote -- said her wish was for "peace on earth and good will to all humankind, regardless of race, colour or creed".
