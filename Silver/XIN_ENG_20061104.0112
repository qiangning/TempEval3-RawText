Chinese President Hu Jintao held here Saturday a welcoming banquet at the Great Hall of the People for the leaders and representatives of 48 African countries, who are here for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.

The Summit, themed on "friendship, peace, cooperation and development", is regarded as the largest diplomatic event ever held between China and Africa.

At the opening ceremony on Saturday morning, Hu announced a package of measures covering assistance, investment, trade and social development for Africa in an effort to forge a new type of strategic partnership and strengthen cooperation in more areas and at a higher level.

Two documents -- a declaration and an action plan for 2007-2009 -- are expected to be adopted at the summit, due to conclude on Sunday.
