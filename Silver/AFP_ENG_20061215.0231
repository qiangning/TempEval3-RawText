India lost both their opening batsmen cheaply when the first Test against South Africa got off to a late start at the Wanderers Stadium Friday.

India were 19 for two at lunch after Wasim Jaffer and Virender Sehwag fell within the space of six balls.

Jaffer was leg before wicket to Makhaya Ntini for nine when he padded up to a ball just outside his off stump which was slanting in.

Sehwag was caught behind off Shaun Pollock in the next over when he was squared up by a lifting delivery. The normally dashing Sehwag scored only four runs off 26 balls.

Indian captain Rahul Dravid, recovered from a finger injury, took a painful blow in the ribs from Pollock. He had yet to score at lunch, while Sachin Tendulkar was on four.

The morning's play was restricted to an hour. The start was delayed by 90 minutes because of damp patches on the pitch.

The Gauteng Cricket Board said the damp patches were caused by wet hessian placed on the pitch overnight because groundsman Chris Scott was concerned that the surface was too dry and that it might break up on the fourth and fifth days.

"After removing the covers this morning, there was a lot more moisture on the wicket than anticipated," he said.

Despite the late start, the pitch looked good for batting on a hot, cloudless day and although there was grass cover it had a brown tinge.

India opted to leave off-spinner Harbhajan Singh out of their final eleven, leaving leg-spinner Anil Kumble as the only specialist slow bowler. South Africa fielded an all-seam attack.

Dale Steyn took the new ball for South Africa but although he bowled fast he did not make the batsmen play enough and he was replaced after three overs by Pollock, who immediately struck a good line and length.

Ntini bowled a fiery spell of six overs before Steyn came on again in the over before lunch.
