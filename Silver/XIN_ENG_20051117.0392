Malaysia has urged the United States to play a greater role in solving the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and the problem in Iraq as soon as possible, local media reported Friday.

The United States should take advantage of its influence to help bring an immediate solution to these issues in a firmer yet fair way, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times.

On the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, the United States seems to be selective in the way it deals with this issues, Badawi told reporters after meeting with US President George W. Bush in Busan, South Korea.

"There seems to be unfairness (in the US treatment) in this issue, That's why problems related to Palestine can not be settled, " said the prime minister who arrived in the port city on Thursday to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.

On the problem in Iraq, Badawi said he had stressed to Bush the importance of Malaysia assisting in the capacity-building in Palestine and Iraq by providing their youth with an opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills in Malaysia.

"By doing so, we will enable them to contribute to the development of their countries," said Badawi at a press conference held with Malaysian reporters there.

Meanwhile, Badawi said Bush had given an assurance that Washington would not intervene in the selection of Iraq's future leader.

Badawi added that his talks with the US president were "very smooth and free flowing."
