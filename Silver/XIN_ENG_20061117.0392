Dutch military interrogators in Iraq were involved in abusing dozens of Iraqi prisoners after the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003, a Dutch newspaper said on Friday.

The detainees were allegedly subjected to bright lights, soaked with water and exposed to high-pitched sounds, according to the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant.

The abuses, involving members of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service, occurred in Samawah in the southeastern Iraqi province of Al Muthanna in November 2003, it reported.

Dutch Defense Minister Henk Kamp, however, denied the accusation, saying that an investigation into the alleged case in 2003 did not reveal any wrongdoings.

But Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said the allegations would be "shocking" if proved true.

He said an independent commission had been set up by the coalition government to re-investigate the case.

The controversy erupted just five days before the Dutch national parliamentary elections.

Opposition politicians have demanded a recall of Parliament to question Kamp about the allegations, and raised suspicion that the government were trying to cover it up.

The Netherlands had about 1,400 troops stationed in the southern province at the time, but most were withdrawn last year.
