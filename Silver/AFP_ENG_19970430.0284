The Philippine foreign ministry summoned Beijing's ambassador to Manila on Wednesday to protest at the presence of armed Chinese vessels in the disputed Spratlys, an official said.

"I formally gave him the details of the reported sightings," said Delia Rosal, executive director of the department's Asia and Pacific Affairs, after meeting China's envoy, Guan Dengming.

"I (conveyed to) him the Philippine concern about this incident," she added.

The Philippine military reported to Ramos on Tuesday that three armed "frigate-type" Chinese vessels were spotted by Air Force reconnaisance aircraft Friday off Philippine-garrisoned Kota and Panata islands in the disputed South China Sea chain.

The Philippines and China are among six countries which claim the supposedly oil-rich South China Sea chain in whole or part, the others being Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.
