Morocco's Agriculture Ministry announced on Friday that it had widened its ban on imports of poultry into the country to include wild birds such as pigeons and falcons.

All Moroccan citizens, as well as importers, have to comply with the enacted regulations, and all banned poultry discovered at border checkpoints will be returned or slaughtered, according to a statement issued by the Agriculture Ministry.

The statement also emphasized that no bird flu cases have been found in Morocco so far, and the country's veterinary administration will continue to closely monitor domestic poultry as well as the latest development of worldwide bird flu pandemic.

The ministry has announced a ban on the importation of live poultry and bird-related products from countries affected by the fatal strain of virus H5N1 on Oct. 17, and carried out more strict sanitary checks on poultry farms, border checkpoints and slaughterhouses.
