South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers are to hold bilateral meeting later Monday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC) forum, according to a schedule distributed by the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Monday.

It will be their first meeting since Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Asao took office in late October.

During their meeting, South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon and Asao are expected to discuss bilateral relations which had been in a cold water since Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi paid a visit to a controversial shrine in October.

On Oct. 17, Koizumi paid his fifth homage to the Yasukuni Shrine which honors 2 million Japanese war dead, including 14 Class A criminals of the World War II.

South Korean Foreign Minister Ban initially hinted at canceling his planned visit to Tokyo in protest against Koizumi's shrine visit but later went ahead with the trip in late October, citing the need for "unavoidable diplomatic activities."

The Ban-Aso meeting, to be held at the BEXCO (Busan Exhibition and Convention) center on late Monday afternoon, comes ahead of a summit meeting between South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and Koizumi on Friday.

The two diplomats are also to have dinner meeting on Monday.

The APEC Ministerial Meeting is scheduled to be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at BEXCO, before the holding of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting on Nov. 18-19 in Busan.
