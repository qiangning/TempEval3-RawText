Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni will not answer a call by rebels for talks with Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony, the president's press adviser said Monday.

The adviser, John Nagenda, said Museveni's position remained that he himself would not talk with Kony, but would not stand in the way of others who wanted to talk with the former Roman Catholic catechist.

The call for talks came at a meeting in London at the weekend of northern Ugandans.

The LRA has been fighting in the north for the past 10 years in a bid to topple Museveni's government and replace it with one based on the Biblical 10 Commandments.

Museveni has offered amnesty to the rank and file guerrillas, but not their leaders.
