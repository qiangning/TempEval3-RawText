The UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva Thursday voted a resolution condemning capital punishment despite opposition from a number of countries, including China, Japan and the United States.

The resolution, passed by 27 votes to 11, also called on countries still practising state-sponsored execution to spare adolescents less than 18 years old and pregnant women.

The countries voting against the text were: Algeria, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea and the United States.

The cautiously-worded text, which asked "all states who still have not abolished the pain of death to limit progressively the number of infractions," also produced 14 abstentions. One country was absent.

Countries still using capital punishment were urged "to contemplate suspending executions with a view to abolishing completely the pain of death," limit its application to only the most serious crimes, to exclude people younger than 18 and pregnant women, and to guarantee the right for those condemned to ask for a pardon or to commute the sentence.
