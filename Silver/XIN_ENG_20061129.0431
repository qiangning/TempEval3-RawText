Discussing energy security without Russia would be unproductive, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday.

"I don't think that attempts to discuss energy security in any format without Russia could be productive and could promote energy security," Lavrov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying in comments on NATO's debate on the issue at a summit in Riga, Latvia.

"Energy security is a subject that concerns everybody," and the interests of all key players -- suppliers, consumers and transit countries -- should be taken into account, he said.

Russia supplies about 25 percent of the gas and oil consumed in the European Union (EU), which is keen to formulate new principles of energy cooperation with Moscow.

EU leaders want Moscow to commit to the Energy Charter, a document that regulates transit and investment in the energy sector and allows for greater market competition from foreign companies. Russia, however, has so far refused to ratify the charter.

Energy security should be regulated by long-term agreements that would stabilize both supply and demand, Lavrov said.
