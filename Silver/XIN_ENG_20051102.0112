Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair is warning Britons of more attempts to attack the country in the coming months.

The police chief of Britain said of the threat as he battled for more powers to deal with suspected terrorists while members of parliament debate the Terrorism Bill.

Blair said in the last few weeks the security service and his force have prevented attacks on Britain.

"The sky is dark. Intelligence exists to suggest that other groups will attempt to attack Britain in the coming months," he was quoted by Sky news on Wednesday.

Ian said police chiefs are united in their support of the 90-day detention proposal which has been highly controversial in the new Terrorism Bill.

Opponents are lobbying for ministers to drop plans to allow police to hold terror suspects for up to 90 days without charge, saying the Bill contains "sweeping and vague provisions that undermine the rights to freedom and expression and association."

Home Secretary Charles Clarke, a staunch supporter of the 90-day proposal, has been pressurized to compromise, saying he is prepared to be "flexible".

However, he warns that the government cannot fight terrorism with "one legal hand tied behind our back."
