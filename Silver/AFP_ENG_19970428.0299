Officials from the United States, Iraq, Iran and Libya attended a forum which opened here Monday on the effects of UN and US sanctions on the oil market and world economy.

"Even if there is no premeditated policy to harm these countries for their anti-Israeli stance, this is the way things are perceived in the region," World Energy Council president Hisham el-Khatib said in his opening speech.

Iraq, Iran and Libya are all oil-producing, Moslem, anti-Israeli countries with strong centralized governments, he said, while the United States is Israel's main ally.

However, the former US assistant secretary of state for the Near East Robert Pelletreau said Washington "bears no ill will toward the peoples of Iran, Iraq and Libya and would like in the long run to see normal relations develop with each of these states."

Pelletreau said Washington adopted, unilaterally or with the United Nations, sanctions to prevent countries from acting "in a way detrimental to US interests and disruptive of regional and even global security and stability."

The former official, who left his post in March, said the partial lifting of sanctions on Iraq under the UN oil-for-food deal beginning in December was not, as Baghdad claimed, the first step toward completely lifting the embargo.

Rather it eased international pressure on Washington, especially from Europe, over the suffering of the Iraqi people, which is the fault of the Iraqi government, he said.

US policy toward Iraq is based on the assumption that "Baghdad has given up none of its ambitions to be the dominant power in the Gulf," Pelletreau added.

"Without Security Council sanctions and US leadership in maintaining them, President Saddam Hussein would be rearming, rebuilding and modernizing his armed forces and developing their nuclear, biological and chemical capabilities as rapidly as possible."

International sanctions were imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and the United Nations has stipulated that Iraq must get rid of its weapons of mass destruction before the sanctions are lifted.

Pelletreau also said that if Iran is behind a bomb attack in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 US servicemen in June, Washington "will respond strongly including, possibly, demanding the imposition of United Nations sanctions."

Pelletreau said that in Iran and in the US Congress, Europe's approach to Tehran was seen as dictated by "commercial interest."

Washington's adoption of sanctions against countries such as Iran, Iraq or Libya in spite of economic losses to US companies "reflects the strong current of morality present in US political decisions," he said.

Edward Morse of the Energy Intelligence Group research institute said "the use of ... economic instruments of foreign policy by the United States has, not accidentally, mushroomed as the Cold War came to an end and as the United States became increasingly the singular fulcrum of international politics."

The United States "can 'get away with' using them for a long time" because of "the current structure of international society, which, for better or worse, is highly US-centric," Morse said.

The three-day forum, sponsored by IBC Gulf Conferences, is headed by Iraq's ambassador to UNESCO, Abdel Amir al-Anbari, and included an oil ministry official.

Iran's position will be presented by an official from its chamber of commerce and Libya's by an advisor to the Libyan central bank.
