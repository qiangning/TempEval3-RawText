Brazil's Health Ministry will provide 50,000 free AIDS tests to pregnant women and adolescents in the poorest region in 2006, officials said here Tuesday.

The tests will be sponsored by the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF).

Last year, the country tested 75 percent of pregnant women for HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. The tests next year will cover the majority of the remaining 25 percent.

"In spite of the alarming numbers, the policies to combat the epidemic haven't given priority to children. Children are rarely mentioned when AIDS is discussed," UNICEF Representative Marie Pierre Poirier told reporters.

Early diagnosis of HIV could prevent 99 percent of transmissions from mother to baby, said the health ministry.

A United Nations report published on Monday said that around 600,000 of Brazil's 183 million citizens (or around 0.3 percent) suffer from HIV.

UNICEF is also campaigning to provide AIDS education and expand access to anti-AIDS drugs in Bolivia, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Paraguay, Sao Tome and Principe, and East Timor.
