Police grappled Wednesday with the grisly task of identifying two new bodies found near a quiet English town gripped by fears of a prostitute serial killer, as the death toll rose to five.

Detectives stepped up the search for forensic evidence after the discovery Tuesday near Ipswich of two corpses believed to be those of missing prostitutes Paula Clennell, 24, and 29-year-old Annette Nicholls.

The finds bring to five the number of bodies found in less than two weeks near the eastern port town.

They have evoked thoughts of one of Britain's most notorious serial killers, east London's elusive Jack the Ripper, who murdered five prostitutes in 1888 and was linked to several other killings.

They have also revived more recent memories of Peter Sutcliffe, the "Yorkshire Ripper", who preyed on prostitutes and murdered 13 women and attacked seven others between 1975 and 1980.

All the corpses have been found in the countryside around Ipswich, some 80 miles (130 kilometres) northeast of London, prompting one of Britain's biggest ever murder inquiries.

"This is a most unprecedented inquiry. Nothing like this has ever happened," said Alastair McWhirter, chief constable, or head, of Suffolk Police.

"If you think back to the Yorkshire Ripper, the murders there took place over a long period of time ... We're responding to it effectively and as well as we possibly can."

The corpses of the first two murdered prostitutes, Gemma Adams, 25, and 19-year-old Tania Nicol, who both went missing from Ipswich's red light district, were found on December 2 and 9 respectively.

Police confirmed Tuesday that the strangled body of a third woman found in woods Sunday was 24-year-old Anneli Alderton.

Later that day, a member of the public found a fourth body and a police helicopter crew member called out to survey the scene spotted the fifth shortly afterwards.

The streets of Ipswich were virtually deserted overnight -- the 30 or so prostitutes who usually work the red light district seemed to heed police advice to stay indoors, while the streets were all but empty of revellers during the normally busy Christmas party season.

Pairs of police officers carried out patrols to reassure local people for the second night running, while motorists were being stopped and questioned.

Suffolk Police, a rural force more used to dealing with illegal raves than fast-moving murder cases, has faced questions from the media about whether it is equipped to cope.

But senior officers insist they are handling it well and have requested assistance from forces around Britain, as well as enlisting a behavioural analyst to help them understand who might have committed the crimes.

Detective Chief Superintendent Stewart Gull, in charge of the investigation, told BBC television that an extra 70 officers would be drafted in Wednesday to help the 100 police already working on the case.

He has described it as "almost a crime in action", adding that "the facts speak for themselves" in terms of similarities between the killings.

The two latest bodies, which remain where they were found, were likely to be identified formally Wednesday, although Gull was cautious in formally confirming this would happen.

No other prostitutes are currently reported missing.
