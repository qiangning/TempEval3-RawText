Two Turkish soldiers and a village guard were killed and four soldiers wounded in a clash between the Turkish security forces and the members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in southeastern Turkey, an official statement said on Tuesday.

One PKK member was also killed in the shootout on Monday night as the security forces realized that the PKK members were trying to infiltrate in Uludere town in Sirnak province, Sirnak governor' s office said.

The PKK has intensified landmine and remote-control bomb attacks in Turkey over the past few months.

At least 200 Turkish soldiers have been reportedly killed in clashes with PKK this year.

More than 37,000 people have been killed since the rebel group took up arms against the government forces for an independent Kurdish state in the mainly Kurdish southeastern area in 1984.

Violence resurged after the group called off a unilateral five- year ceasefire in 2004.
