Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa on Monday congratulated Joseph Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), for his re-election in the October presidential run-off.

State-owned Zambia News and Information Services (ZANIS) cited a message from Mwanawasa as saying that Kabila's re-election was a clear testimony of the confidence that the people of DRC have in his proven leadership ability.

Mwanawasa said Zambia has followed the democratic process that has taken place in the DRC, adding that Kabila's re-election was a reflection of people's willingness to participate and consolidate democracy in that country.

Meanwhile, Mwanawasa assured his counterpart of his support as he will work towards reconciliation and development.

The Supreme Court of the DRC confirmed on Monday that incumbent Kabila was the winner of the October 29 presidential run-off with 58 percent support, rejecting the challenge by Vice President Jean- Pierre Bemba.
