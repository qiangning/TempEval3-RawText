The resignation of the UN special envoy for Cyprus is unlikely to break the momentum toward the first direct talks between the two communities in almost three years, diplomats say.

Han Sung Joo of South Korea made the surprise announcement late Monday that he was stepping down after a year in the post which is at the centre of efforts to end the eastern Mediterranean island's 23-year division.

"Given the growing level of intensity ... I thought it would be in the best interests of the parties concerned for the UN to have someone who can devote more time to handling the Cyprus issue," he said.

Han, who has academic commitments in his native South Korea where he has been based, reported progress in efforts to resume direct peace talks between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and the breakaway Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.

The two leaders have not met since October 1994.

Both Cypriot and Turkish diplomats at the United Nations said that Han's departure should not make a difference to the negotiating process in which UN chief Kofi Annan has taken a personal interest since taking office in January.

Annan's representative in Cyprus, Gustave Feissel, has been mediating proximity talks since March between the Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot leaders, in a bid to lay the groundwork for direct talks by the middle of the year.

Annan, in a statement issued in Rome on Monday, praised Han's contribution and stressed that he was "determined to press ahead with an intensified effort to bring about a comprehensive settlement in the island."

He repeated that he hoped for direct talks "within the next two or three months."

The United Nations is leading international efforts to build a bi- zonal, bi-communal federation in Cyprus.

The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkish mainland troops invaded the northern third of Cyprus in the wake of a coup in Nicosia backed by the right-wing junta then ruling Greece.

Western diplomats said that Annan would have the difficult task of finding a replacement for Han who is familiar with the issues while being acceptable to both the Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot communities.

And in the light of ethnic unrest which has hit the island since last summer, "things could be disrupted" along the road to a summit, one diplomat said.

The five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- are expected to discuss Cyprus at Russia's suggestion later this month.

But diplomats cautioned that the Security Council was unlikely to take any initiatives on the issue.

"The next qualitative step will be when the (UN) secretary-general issues invitations to the direct talks," one western diplomat said.
