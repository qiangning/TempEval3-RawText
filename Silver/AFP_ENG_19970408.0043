Malaysia's central bank Tuesday moved to clear up confusion over new bank lending curbs which have depressed the stock market in the past week.

Bank Negara deputy governor Fong Weng Phak admitted "monetary measures are always difficult to implement but it is unfortunate that people have over-reacted without understanding or rationalising" the policies.

"The measures are not meant to curtail or squeeze the economy but to reallocate financial resources to the more productive manufacturing and services sectors," Fong told a news conference.

The key index on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange recovered 1.4 percent at the close of morning trade Tuesday, from its Monday close. During last week's trading, the index plunged 6.6 percent following Bank Negara's announcement on March 28 of new credit-tightening measures.

The central bank limited lending to the property sector to 20 percent of banks' total outstanding loans, excluding homes costing 60,000 dollars and below, infrastructure projects and industrial facilities.

In the area of share financing, it maintained a 15 percent lending cap for commercial banks but broadened the definition to include loans to holding companies and investment firms which use credit to finance share trading.

"We know there shall always be grey areas and loopholes but we think it's timely to implement these preemptive measures before the asset inflation bubble bust," Fong said.

Clarifying the rules, Fong said the limits exclude a wide segment of the property sector, including "owner-occupied" houses, apartments, shophouses, hotels, theme parks, holiday resorts, as well as equipment and machinery.

Lending for initial public offers for manufacturing and infrastructure companies and stock options for employees would not be covered under the measures.

Guarantees given by merchant banks for profits of companies seeking to list on the local bourse -- part of the securities commission's requirements -- are also exempted from the credit curbs.

"We do not want banks who have exceeded the limits to pull back the existing credit lines but to trim exposure to the two sectors. As their loan base expands, the ratio will fall," Fong said.

Banks are expected to submit by April 15 proposals to reduce lending to the two sectors and dialogues have been held with bank executives to clarify doubts, he added.

"The number of banks who have exceeded the limits is not large. This is not an industry-wide issue. We have the luxury of time to implement these measures while the economy is still strong," Fong said.

"The fate of the economy and the banking sector is intertwined. It is not right for us to do nothing after seeing the experience of other countries," he added, alluding to neighbouring Thailand, recently rocked by a financial crisis triggered by bad property debts.
