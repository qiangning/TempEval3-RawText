World number one Roger Federer kept in low status Tuesday as the two-time defending champion of the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup was pulled into tiebreaker of decider before avoiding a defeat at just the second match in Shanghai.

It took two hours and 17 minutes of the 24-year-old Swiss to defeat the in-form Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-3, 2-6, 7-6(4), with a forehanded shot out of Ljubicic's reach for the tiebreaker win.

After Sunday's stumble win from Federer against Argentina's David Nalbandian, the last man having qualified for the elite eight-man field, nothing wrong from the tennis super star could be more shocking, even another rare fightback and a tiebreaker.

With all the embarrassments of backhand errors, weak returns and slow paces, Federer just repeated his sluggish form shown in Nalbandian's match, being broken twice in the second set after taking the first using an advantage of serving first.

Forced the decider, the superlative, who has compiled another outstanding season with an ATP-best 11 titles including two Grand Slam and a record four ATP Masters Series crown, should have shortened his work of Ljubicic in the ninth game before his two match points in hand were denied by the Croatian with some placement shots.

Ljubicic, who enjoyed his best season by winning two ATP titles in eight finals and broke into top ten for first time, then continually moved Federer to play close to the net and transferred errors from the Swiss to his own benefit before holding on to force tiebreaker.

With the victory, Federer saved his near-perfect record at the Tennis Masters Cup, increased his winning streak to 33, and extended his season-best match record to 79-3.

The Shanghai match was the first in six weeks for Federer, who has already clinched the world No. 1 year-end ranking for the second year in succession. He last competed in Bangkok, winning his 11th title of the season on October 2.
