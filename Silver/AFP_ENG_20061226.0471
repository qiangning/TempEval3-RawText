The Agricultural Bank of China, the country's fourth largest lender, may get a 100-billion-dollar cash injection in 2007 in preparation for an overseas listing, state media reported Wednesday.

Liu Mingkang, chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the industry watchdog, told reporters at a finance forum there will be "good news" next year in terms of restructuring the bank, the China Daily reported.

The bank is the last of the four major banks to undergo a joint stock reform that may include, apart from the capital injection from the government, spinning off losses and setting up a joint stock company, the report said.

Agricultural Bank of China is widely seen as the most troubled of China's four state-owned commercial banks.

An official with a central government investment arm was quoted by the newspaper as saying the bank's massive bad loans may push reform costs up to 100 billion dollars.

This is a significantly larger amount than the cash injections received by the three other top state-owned commercial lenders before listing overseas.

The Bank of China and the China Construction Bank got 22.5 billion dollars each, while the Industrial Bank of China received 15 billion dollars.

A final decision on the bank's reform plan will not be confirmed until the Central Financial Work Conference expected to take place before next February's Chinese New Year holiday, the newspaper said.

Last year, 26.2 percent of the bank's 2.8 trillion yuan (356 billion dollars) loans were non-performing, the report said.
