Japan's trade surplus in March was down 26.8 percent from a year earlier at 818.3 billion yen (6.49 billion dollars) but up from 686.7 billion yen in February, the finance ministry said Thursday.

Exports were up 10.5 percent at 4.54 billion yen while imports were up 24.4 percent at 3.72 billion yen, it said.

For the fiscal year ending in March, the trade surplus narrowed 29.6 percent to 6,421 billion yen.

A ministry official said the decline in Japan's trade surplus was "slowing", apparently referring to the impact of the weaker yen.

Tokyo Research Institute economist Toshio Sumitani said the March surplus was below his forecast for a trade imbalance of one trillion yen.

"Imports were stronger than expected ... Crude oil prices have fallen recently, so I did not expect strong imports," he said, citing "extraordinary factors" for the increase.

Sumitani also noted that exports to the United States remained high and this was expected to continue boosting the surplus in the coming months.

"The pace of the movement in the trade surplus year on year is slowing, because of slowing exports to the Asian and European markets," he said.

In March alone, Japan's surplus with the United States, its biggest trading partner, surged 11.2 percent to 380 billion yen with exports up 14.3 percent at 1,260 billion yen and imports up 15.7 percent at 880 billion yen.

The surplus with Asia shrank 17.9 percent to 635 billion yen, with exports up 7.6 percent at 1,922 billion yen and imports increasing 27.0 percent to 1,287 billion yen.

With the European Union, the trade surplus narrowed 39.2 percent to 131 billion yen. Exports to the EU countries rose 2.5 percent to 676 billion yen with imports down 22.8 percent at 545 billion yen.
