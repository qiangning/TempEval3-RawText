Britain's opposition Labour party has maintained a 24 percent lead over the Conservatives, according to the latest newspaper opinion released on Thursday.

The Independent/Harris poll, to be published in the paper Friday, put Labour on 52 percent and the Conservatives on 28 percent, a drop of two percent for both parties, but still the same margin as last week.

Support for the centrist Liberal Democrats was up three percent, from 11 percent to 14 percent, and anti-European Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum party scored 3.2 percent.

Harris interviewed 1,091 adults face-to-face in their homes between March 27 and 31.

A survey for The Times on Thursday suggested Labour had an unprecedented 27-point lead, five points up, at 55 percent, and the Tories down one percent.

The new polls dash Tory hopes that Labour's lead was beginning to narrow and are in stark contrast to an ICM poll in the The Guardian on Wednesday that showed the Tories cutting the gap from 18 points to 14.
