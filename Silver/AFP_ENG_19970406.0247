Aslan Maskhadov, the president of the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya, is planning a pilgrimage to Mecca this year, Russian television reported Sunday.

Maskhadov's hajj, which will also take him to Saudi Arabia's second holy city Medina, will be his first foreign trip since he was elected president in January.

Interfax news agency said Maskhadov wanted to meet Arab leaders during his trip and "draw their attention to the difficult situation Chechnya is in."

The president also planned to warn Arab states not to give money to every Chechen envoy who asks for it. "This money is then used to finance different armed gangs whose aim is to undermine the Chechen state," he said.

Maskhadov did not specify who he meant.

The president, who plans to also drum up financial aid for his republic, ruined by 21 months of war against Moscow forces, did not say when he would leave, but Interfax said April 11 was a probable date.

The Chechen and Moscow authorities have agreed to reach an understanding on the status of Chechnya by 2001. While Chechens already consider that they have de facto independence, Moscow still views Chechnya as a part of Russia.
