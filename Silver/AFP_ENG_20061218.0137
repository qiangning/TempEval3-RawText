Nine Taliban rebels and an Afghan soldier were killed and 14 insurgents were captured in fresh fighting across insurgency-hit Afghanistan, officials said Monday.

A major firefight broke out early Monday after nearly 200 militants crossed the border from Pakistan and attacked a border checkpost in the eastern Afghan province of Khost, police said.

Five Taliban fighters and an Afghan militia soldier died in the hour-long exchange of fire, provincial police official Gul Dad said, adding that four Afghan nationals were arrested.

Pakistani militants "were also with them fighting our troops," Dad told AFP, citing documents found on the bodies of the dead rebels. "It was a heavy battle."

Self-confessed Taliban spokesman Mohammad Hanif claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the ousted Islamists but said only one rebel was killed.

The fighting took place days after Afghan President Hamid Karzai publicly accused the Pakistani government for the first time of supporting Taliban rebels. Islamabad denies the claims.

Meanwhile, four Taliban insurgents were killed in a separate clash late Sunday in the southern province of Kandahar which also left three US-led coalition soldiers injured, the US military said in a statement.

The raid supported by warplanes "seized an enemy weapons cache containing mines and explosives" near Kandahar city, the birthplace of the Taliban and a continuing focus for the insurgency.

Also on Monday, coalition troops backed by Afghan army soldiers detained 10 "suspected terrorists" including an Al-Qaeda-linked militant in the eastern province of Kunar, another troubled region on the Pakistani border.

"The operation resulted in the capture of a known transporter of weapons and explosives who is linked to foreign fighter movements in the region," the coalition said in a statement.

The man, whose name and nationality were not disclosed, was also responsible for facilitating suicide bombings which have increased in Afghanistan in recent months, the statement said.

"Credible information led the combined force to believe the transporter and his associates were at the compound," which the rebels shared with women and children, it said, adding that there were no civilian casualties in the raid.

Some 4,000 people, many of them militants but also troops and civilians, have died in Taliban-led violence this year alone, making it Afghanistan's bloodiest year since the movement was toppled by US-led forces in 2001.
