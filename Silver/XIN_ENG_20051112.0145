The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC) said on Saturday preparations for the Senate elections are at an advanced stage with the National Logistical Committee mobilizing resources to ensure everything is in place to conduct the poll on November 26.

ZEC spokesperson Ethloile Silaigwana said logistical committees had been established in all the provinces to mobilize resources for the successful holding of the elections.

"Preparations are at an advanced stage with multiparty liaison committees now functional in the constituencies to attend to issues about the elections," he said.

ZEC established the National Logistic Committee on October 14 this year to mobilize resources for the Senate elections.

Silaigwana said multiparty liaison committees were encouraging political tolerance, peace and good conduct during campaigning and on the date of the elections.

An intensive voter education exercise was also going on in the constituencies, reminding people on their constitutional right to participate in the elections as well as educating voters on the correct documents to take to the polling stations so that they would not be turned away.

Voters were also being educated on the constitutional boundaries so that they went to the constituencies where they were registered, he said.

The exercise started on November 7 and ends on November 20 this year.

Silaigwana said the National Multiparty Liaison Committee that comprised all the candidates participating in the election had set out the ground rules to be observed as well as agreed on a code of conduct that supporters of each party would observe during campaigning.

He said the Committee was a mechanism to ensure that all parties conducted their business in a peaceful manner.

So far the situation on the ground was calm and peaceful and none of the candidates had reported incidences of violence, he said.

"We are predicting a peaceful election," said Silaigwana.

In the past, violence has characterized elections in Zimbabwe, resulting in the death of people and destruction of property.

The Senate elections have caused divisions in the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, one faction opposed to participation while the other is supporting.
