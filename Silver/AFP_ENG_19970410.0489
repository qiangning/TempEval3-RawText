One worker was killed Thursday and eight others injured, seven seriously, when a 360-tonne part of a pillar fell off the Vasco da Gama bridge, Europe's largest bridge project, officials said.

Up to five people were feared lost in the waters of the Tagus river, a navy spokesman said. Rescue operations were halted Thursday afternoon but will resume at high tide.

A spokesman for the builders, Lusoponte, said a British engineer was among the injured but declined to name him. All other injured were Portuguese.

The spokesman would not confirm or deny the number of missing.

The first state television channel said two people died, three went missing and nine were hurt in the accident, the first fatal one on the construction site.

Construction on the 12-kilometer (seven-mile) bridge, Europe's longest, began three years ago. It is due to be opened in May 1998, in time for the World's Fair in Lisbon.

First television reports said a shuttle travelling on the bridge derailed after the rupture or collapse of a metal structure and plunged into the river, 30 meters (100 feet) below.

The LUSA news agency said between 14 and 16 people were at the site when the accident happened at lunch hour. Normally up to 24 people work there, the agency said.

Lusoponte suspended work on the bridge, named after the 15th-century Portuguese navigator, and sent all workers home.
