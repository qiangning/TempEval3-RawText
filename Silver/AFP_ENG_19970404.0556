The UN Security Council Friday denounced Libya for a "clear violation" of a UN air embargo for carrying passengers from Libya for the annual hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca.

In a statement read by council president Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, the council noted that arrangements had been made for Libyan worshippers to travel to Saudi Arabia without violating the embargo.

But diplomats here said no additional action is planned against Tripoli.

Libya violated the embargo for the third consecutive year Friday by bringing 105 pilgrims, including members of Libya's official delegation, to Saudi Arabia on a Libyan Arab Airways flight.

The plane returned to Libya the next morning.

Libya also violated the flight embargo in 1995 and 1996 to transport pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, and for some trips by its leader, Colonel Moamer Kadhafi.

The United Nations imposed an international embargo on Libya in April 1992 for its refusal to hand over two Libyans suspected of involvement in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people.
