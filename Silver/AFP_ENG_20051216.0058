Australia recovered from the early loss of Matthew Hayden to reach 173-3 at tea on day one of the first Test against South Africa on Friday.

Captain Ricky Ponting hit a half-century while Brad Hodge (37) and Michael Hussey (20) were the not-out batsmen at the break.

Makhaya Ntini had dismissed opener Hayden for a duck with his second ball to leave Australia on 0-1.

But Ponting and Justin Langer were looking in ominous form as Australia reached 96-1 at lunch.

The visitors then grabbed two quick wickets in the second session to stem the flow of runs.

Ntini dismissed Langer for 37 as the diminutive left-hander botched a pull shot, sending the ball skywards to captain Graeme Smith at mid-off.

Shaun Pollock then trapped Ponting lbw for 71 with a ball which nipped back from the off side, ending the Australian captain's 12-boundary knock.

South Africa then missed a great opportunity to gain the ascendancy when wicketkeeper Mark Boucher missed a thick top-edge Brad Hodge when he was on three.

Had Boucher taken the catch, the Proteas would have had the Australians at 117-4. But the ball went to the boundary instead.

The tourists went into the match without key all-rounder Jacques Kallis who failed a last-minute fitness test on his left elbow.

It was the first time in two years that Kallis has missed a Test match.

Jacques Rudolph was brought into the side while orthodox spinner Nicky Boje was left out in favour of a pace attack on a wicket known for it's speed and bounce.

For Australia, seamer Nathan Bracken was named in their bowling attack.
