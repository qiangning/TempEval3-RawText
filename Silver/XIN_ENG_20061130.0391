A large amount of the window prostitution in Amsterdam's famous red light district will be shut down as the city gets tougher on criminal activities, Dutch news agency ANP reported on Thursday.

The Amsterdam city council said investigations had revealed about one-third of the prostitution sector is allegedly involved in money laundering.

Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands and Amsterdam's red light district is well known for the prostitutes that offer their services from behind glowing windows to their "customers."

A total of 33 permits for the sex windows were revoked. About 100 of the 350 prostitution windows in the Dutch capital's red light district will be forced to close by the end of the year.

However, the operators of the sex windows can still appeal against the city council's decision to withdraw their permits.

Under a law introduced in 2003, the Amsterdam city council can investigate the operational management in the sex industry so as to prevent authorities from unintentionally supporting criminal activities by issuing permits and subsidies.

It is the first time that the city council used the new regulations. Amsterdam now intends to investigate the rest of the city's sex industry, including its brothels.

Hotels, cafes and restaurants will also be investigated.
