The United States wants China put on the spot over its suspect human rights record at the UN Human Rights Commission's annual meeting here, US rights envoy John Shattuck said Monday.

Shattuck was in Geneva to lobby against a Chinese motion to block a resolution criticising its human rights record, which would in effect block the 53-state Commission's annual meeting from discussing it.

"No country, no matter how large, no matter how strongly it feels about the subject, should be able to block consideration by the commission of its rights record," said Shattuck, US Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights.

China, as in previous years, has lodged a non-action motion to block criticism at the forum on Tuesday.

"For this reason, we are concerned by the efforts of the government of China to foreclose discussion through a non-action motion on the resolution," the US official said.
