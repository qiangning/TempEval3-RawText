Denmark, backed by the United States and 13 other countries, filed a resolution Thursday denouncing Chinese human rights abuses, despite threats from Beijing and deep European divisions over the issue.

Danish Ambassador Tyge Lehmann waited until literally the last minute before presenting the resolution to the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva at 1559 GMT in order to muster maximum support.

The 53-members of the commission will vote on the text next Tuesday, but diplomats believed that, as on all previous occasions, the anti- China resolution would be defeated through skillful Chinese lobbying.

Denmark's motion received support from nine fellow EU members, the United States, Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland.

But, for the first time, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece all withdrew their support, ending EU unity on the issue.

Australia, which had co-sponsored the anti-China resolution for six years without success, was also among the countries withholding support for Thursday's motion.

"Governments not confortable with not showing solidarity have promised to support the resolution as such and to move to defeat the non-action motion," Lehman said.

However, diplomats said the resolution had little chance of being adopted.

China has faced a similar resolution every year since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

Denmark stepped in Saturday and announced it would put forward the motion after the European Union failed to agree on a joint position on the annual human rights debate.

China had stepped up the pressure on Denmark in a last-gasp effort to prevent the Danish-sponsored resolution from being presented.

"This motion will be like Denmark lifting a rock only to drop it on its own head," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang warned earlier Thursday.

"It will be a heavy loss for Denmark as the leader of the pack usually suffers the brunt of the attack," he added.

Diplomats said no Asian country was willing to back the text after the defection of Japan, and African and South American countries also held back.

Lehmann said he hoped all the countries who had withheld support would return to back the motion next Tuesday.

All previous resolutions have been defeated as a result of intense lobbying by Beijing, which presents the debate as a clash between North and South.

Denmark's motion criticised violations of fundamental liberties and called for the respect of all human rights, impartial administration of justice, the release of political prisoners and the protection of Tibetans' cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious identity.

In Beijing, the Danish embassy confirmed that it and other EU member missions had been summoned by the Chinese foreign ministry for a dressing down over their support for the resolution.

"They explained their objections and we explained our position," Danish Ambassador Christopher Bo Bramsen said.

Arguing that Beijing had taken major steps in improving human rights over the past few decades, Shen accused western nations of turning a blind eye to China's progress.

"Some are also blind to human rights abuses in their own countries, and yet they still seek to impose their values on others," he said.

Highlighting the social and cultural differences between countries, Shen said the only way to resolve human rights disputes was through dialogue based on the principles of mutual respect and equality.

Defending Canberra's decision not to support the draft, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia was only interested in effective action on human rights.

"The only way we believe that in our human rights diplomacy with China we can be remotely effective is by establishing some kind of dialogue," Downer said, pointing to a Sino-Australian agreement to hold a formal bilateral dialogue on the issue.
