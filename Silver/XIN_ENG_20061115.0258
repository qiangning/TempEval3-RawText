For General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., both hungry for cash, have had to pledge some of their most essential assets -- such as factories and equipment -- as collateral to win badly needed new loans, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.

GM, which posted a 10.6 billion dollar loss last year, in July extended a credit line from a syndicate of banks under new terms that give the company a 4.6 billion dollar revolving loan backed by North American assets including inventory, plants and property, said the report

Ford also moved in the same direction. As part of a conference call on its earnings restatement, Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair said Tuesday that Ford aims to put together a loan deal that is likely to be secured "by a significant portion of the assets of the company, according to the report.

Ford's losses amount to about 7 billion dollars so far this year, and the company is on pace to approach GM's 10.6 billion dollar 2005 loss.

Without specifying a time frame, Leclair said Ford would have a deal to announce "fairly soon." He added that Ford is pursuing the deal "because it is prudent to do so."
