Bulgaria hopes to reach a deal with the United States on the deployment of US troops at Bulgaria's military bases by spring next year, Bulgarian Defense Minister Vesselin Bliznakov said on Tuesday.

"I hope all the details will be agreed and we can have a deal maybe in February or March," he said.

On Saturday, Lyubomir Ivanov, Bulgaria's chief negotiator and ambassador to NATO, said the two countries had agreed to jointly use the Novo Selo shooting range and the Bezmer airport, both in central Bulgaria.

Washington aims to pull about 70,000 troops out of Germany and Asia in the next decade and is planning to create small, flexible bases in Eastern Europe.

Bulgaria joined US-led NATO last year along with six other Eastern European nations. The United States is also in talks with Romania over the use of its military bases.
