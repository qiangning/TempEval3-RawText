Hungary observed a day of national mourning on Saturday for the funeral of Ferenc Puskas, one of the greatest footballers of all time who led the "Mighty Magyars" to world dominance in the 1950s and Real Madrid to a string of titles in the 1960s.

Puskas, who died after a long battle with Alzheimer's on November 17 aged 79, was the inspiration of Hungary's "Golden Team," which won Olympic gold in 1952 and was runner-up to Germany in the 1954 World Cup.

One of the game's best-ever strikers, Puskas scored a remarkable 83 goals in 84 international matches for Hungary from 1945 to 1956.

"How many times his fearsome left foot drove defenders crazy and led his team to victory. A nation and the entire world grieves," Jeno Buzanszky, one of only two surviving members of the "Golden Team", told a memorial service at the national stadium.

FIFA president Joseph Blatter, former French great Michel Platini, German icon Franz Beckenbauer and retired Real Madrid aces Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento, who were Puskas' teammates, were also in attendance.

But only a few thousand Hungarian fans showed up, leaving many disappointed that people could not fill the stadium, renamed after Puskas in 2002, to its capacity as in the glory years of Hungarian football.

"There is hardly anyone here, this indifference makes me so sad. This is an embarrassment and it makes me want to cry," said a choked-up mourner, Janos Szalai.

The "Golden Team" signalled its dominance in 1953 with a stunning 6-3 thrashing of England at Wembley, becoming the first overseas team to beat the English side on their home turf. Puskas scored twice in that match.

After his defection to Spain in the wake of the failed 1956 Hungarian uprising against Soviet domination, Puskas joined Real Madrid where he was a cornerstone of the club which won three European Cup titles and seven league championships during his decade there from 1958 to 1967.

"Ferenc left an indelible mark as a player and as a person. Thank you Hungary, thank you Pancho," Ramon Calderon, Real Madrid's President, said in a tribute at Puskas stadium, using the legend's Spanish nickname.

Following the memorial service, a procession, with a six-horse carriage drawing Puskas' casket, went through the city to Saint Stephen's Basilica, where the legendary player was buried.

The procession stopped for a military salute at Heroes' Square, in honor of the "Galloping Major," so called because of his military rank while playing for his Hungarian club Kispest.

Born in 1927 in Budapest, Puskas was only 15 when he started playing for Kispest, later renamed Honved, or Army, in 1949.

From 1927 to 1956, Puskas scored 358 goals in 349 matches.

He was posthumously promoted to brigadier-general.

"All over the world, the first thing that comes to people's minds about Hungarians is Puskas. Everyone says his name with a smile and with joy," Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom said at a mass before Puskas was laid to rest inside the basilica.

Besides his stellar career as a player, Puskas was also an accomplished coach, directing Greek club Panathinaikos to league crowns twice and to a European Cup final in the 1970-71 season.

In the 1970s and 80s, Puskas coached nearly a dozen teams from North and South America, Europe, Africa and even Australia.

Among the teams he directed from the bench were Chilean club Colo-Colo, Greek side AEK Athens, Egyptian side Al-Masri and Panhellenic Melbourne in Australia.

Puskas settled in Hungary after the fall of communism and briefly held the job of caretaker coach of the national squad in 1993.

This is the first time since the country's transition to democracy that a day of mourning has been declared for the funeral of a sports star, in homage to the legend who became the "best-known Hungarian in the world."
