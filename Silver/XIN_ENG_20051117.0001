Colombian cyclist Maria Luisa Calle, who has been cleared of doping charges following an appeal with a sports arbitration body, will get back the bronze medal she won at the Athens Olympics in a special ceremony, her lawyer Andres Charria told reporters on Wednesday.

The bronze medal arrived in Colombia on Wednesday, Charria said, adding that a ceremony will be held for the medal presentation according to a fax from the International Olympic Committee(IOC).

"The IOC fax that I saw said there will be an Olympic ceremony... I believe it will be a large ceremony," he said.

The IOC has asked Mario Vasquez, president of the Pan-American Sports Organization to deliver the medal. Colombian president Alvaro Uribe is also expected to attend the medal presentation.

In October the Court or Arbitration for Sport (CAS) reinstated Calle as the bronze medalist from the women's point race in Athens and overturned her disqualification by the IOC, saying the headache medication she took did not contain banned substances. The IOC had ratified the decision by the CAS.
