Syria and Iraq have singed a memo of understanding to give facilities to Iraqis living in Syria to cast ballots in the Iraqi election due in December, the Tishin newspaper reported on Thursday.

According to the memo, 10 voting centers will be established in and around the capital of Damascus to guarantee participation of a large number of Iraqis living there.

"This move comes to assert Syria's desire to make the current political process in Iraq a success, which aims at putting an end to bloody violence that kills innocent civilians and boosting Iraq's stability and unity," the paper quoted a foreign ministry statement as saying.

Director of the Organizations and International Conferences at the Foreign Ministry Faisal Hamwi and Head of Iraqi Custody Service in Damascus Sabah Imam inked the memo, the paper said.

The Iraqi election will be held in mid-December to choose members of the National Assembly.
