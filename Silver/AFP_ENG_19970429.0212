Armed soldiers abducted 60 adults along with around 50 hospitalized Rwandan refugee children from a village in eastern Zaire, a UN refugee agency spokeswoman said here Tuesday.

The adults were relatives and individuals caring for the children, who were suffering from malnutrition and other serious illnesses, spokeswoman Pamela O'Toole said.

The victims were reportedly seized early Saturday from a hospital in Lwiro, 30 kilometres (around 19 miles) north of Bikavu in South Kivu province by around 20 soldiers who fired into the air before the kidnapping, warning residents to stay indoors.

"These people have not been seen since and there have been reports that they may have been killed," O'Toole said.

Hospital staff in Lwiro said they recognized among the troops the chief of a rebel Alliance unit in Katana, UNICEF spokesman Patrick McCormick reported Monday, citing a communications officer in Kinshasa. Katana is north of Lwiro.

"We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms," O'Toole said.

"We have already raised this issue with local authorities and have been assured there will be an investigation," she said.

Separately, she said the discovery of some 20 Rwandan refugee corpses at Biaro camp, which was emptied last week of its roughly 30,000 inhabitants, were the latest in a series of human rights abuses in alliance held territory in eastern Zaire.

Some of the bodies, as well as some of the wounded, bore signs of machete attacks, she said.

Up to 10,000 famished refugees have wandered back to the camp, 40 kilometres south of Kisangani, according to the UNHCR.

Rebel Alliance leader Laurent Kabila has given humanitarian agencies on the ground a 60-day ultimatum to repatriate all refugees from eastern Zaire, after which he would complete the task himself.

"While we appreciate the promise of (Kabila) to help us locate and repatriate the refugees, we are receiving increasingly shocking reports of refugees both in the area around Kisangani and elsewhere."

"These killings must stop and an urgent investigation must be launched," she said.
