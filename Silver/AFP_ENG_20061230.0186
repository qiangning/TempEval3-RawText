Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said Saturday he was "concerned" over tensions fanned in Iraq by the execution of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

"From the first hours, we've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence, as you could have predicted," Prodi said outside his home in Bologna, the ANSA news agency reported.

"I hope it won't continue," he added.

Within hours of Saddam's dawn hanging in Baghdad, a car bomb exploded in a fish market in the central Iraqi Shiite city of Kufa, killing at least 31 people, but it was not immediately clear whether the attack represented the first reprisal from his supporters.

Prodi on Friday had issued a final plea against Saddam's execution, calling for "wisdom and magnanimity to prevail".

"No fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another. This is a principle that unites all civilizations and all religions. And it is the only principle that can allow the building of solid and lasting peace," he said.

"The decision to go ahead with the execution of Saddam Hussein fills us with horror. We had hoped that human pity and political sense would inspire wiser decisions," he added.

Other Italian left-wing commentators also denounced the execution, calling it "barbaric" and "a new political mistake."

Right-wing politicians echoed the left's opposition to the death penalty, but a Forza Italia official, Fabrizio Cicchitto, lamented that capital punishment practiced routinely in China and Cuba does not elicit such a vocal reaction.

Only the far-right Northern League hailed the execution, with former reforms minister Roberto Calderoli saying Saddam "had to pay for the barbarisms and crimes he committed."
