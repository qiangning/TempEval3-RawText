Struggling English Premiership side West Ham on Monday sacked manager Alan Pardew.

The club are in 18th place in the Premiership after Saturday's 4-0 thrashing at Bolton with only three points separating them from bottom club Watford.

The Hammers have lost five of their last six Premiership games including both matches since Icelandic businessman Eggert Magnusson became chairman a week ago.
