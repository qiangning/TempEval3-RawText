Thailand's national security will remain under close surveillance following the revocation of the ban on political gatherings, Supreme Commander Boonsang Niempradit said on Friday.

The agencies responsible for security will continue to monitor the national situation closely because the nation's returning to stability will be the major reason the Council for National Security (CNS) to consider lifting martial law, the next move after agreeing to the proposed lifting of the ban on political gatherings.

The CNS and the interim government it installed revoked the No. 7 Announcement issued on September 20 by the military Council for Democratic Reform (CDR), now known as the CNS, which prohibited gatherings of over five people for political purposes. The National Legislative Assembly (NLA) unanimously voted to endorse lifting the ban when it convened on Thursday.

The supreme commander conceded that he was concerned over the national security after the political gatherings ban was lifted.

"Regarding the security issue, I must take care of it all the time. No matter in the past or present we can't forget about security," Boonsang said. "National security is the same as oxygen. When we're well, we don't think about it. But when we have trouble or lack oxygen, we realize that we badly need it."

As for the lifting of martial law imposed throughout the kingdom since the September 19 coup, Boonsang said he could not give a specific time when it will be revoked since the matter must be discussed and decided by various parties.

NLA Speaker Meechai Ruchuphan said that although the CDR Order No.7 has been revoked, political parties remain unable to perform their political activities because other two relevant announcements also issued by CDR, namely Orders No. 15, and No. 27 prohibiting political parties' political activities remain in effect.

"The revocation of the Order No.7 will allow only the general public to gather or talk politically but political activities carried out by political parties themselves or others supported by political parties are not allowed yet," the assembly speaker explained.
