Leaders of France's small Greens party struck an electoral pact with the main opposition Socialists on Wednesday in a bid to bolster the left's chances of victory in forthcoming snap elections.

Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin and Greens' leader Dominique Voynet ended months of joint talks on the terms of a pact with an agreement to run joint candidates in certain constituencies and avoid confrontation in others.

"We are satisfied," Voynet, who heads "Les Verts" (Greens), said on emerging from the talks. Jospin described the deal, which comes on the heels of a pact the previous day with the Communists, as part of his drive "to assemble the forces of the left."

Barely 10 days after President Jacques Chirac called the two-round ballot scheduled for May 25 and June 1, opinion polls are forecasting victory for his ruling rightwing coalition but with a sizeable cut in its 464-seat parliamentary majority.

The latest survey predicted 296 seats for the governing coalition against 258 for the left. The CSA polling institute gave the Socialists, Greens and small leftwing groups 237 seats and the Communists 21. The extreme right National Front could win one 1, it said.

At their talks, Voynet and Jospin agreed to refrain from fielding competing candidates in just over 100 of France's 577 constituencies but need further talks with the Communists before reach agreement on how best to hinder candidates from the extreme rightwing National Front from winning election.

The left, working hard to gather momentum ahead of the poll, on Tuesday also reached agreement with the Communists.

The seven-page text, a joint declaration rather than a program for government, lists several points of convergence between the two parties and calls on French voters to assure victory for the left.

Skirting the Communists' opposition to the contentious issue of the further integration of Europe, the document invokes a compromise, speaking of going "beyond the Treaty of Maastricht" and "redirecting European construction towards a social Europe".

The declaration vows that the left will make job creation "an absolute priority", creating 700,000 jobs for young people and reducing the work week to 35 hours while maintaining salary levels.

The PS-PC text also calls for a halt to privatisations including those of France Telecom and Air France.
