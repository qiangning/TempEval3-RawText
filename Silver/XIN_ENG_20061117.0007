Segolene Royal from France's Socialist Party (PS) won a resounding victory in the party's primary on Friday, taking her closer toward becoming France's first female president, PS spokesman Stephane Le Foll said.

In a ballot of some 220,000 Socialist Party (PS) members, Royal won slightly over 60 percent of the vote, well over the 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a second round in the primary against her two experienced rivals, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Laurent Fabius.

There will be only one round of voting and Segolene Royal will be the presidential candidate of the Socialist Party in 2007, said Le Foll.

According to preliminary results, Strauss-Kahn collected 20.8 percent of the vote and Fabius 18.5 percent.

The figures may change slightly when the results of overseas French voters are added, but no big change is expected.

Royal, who voted Thursday afternoon in the western town of Melle, acknowledged victory shortly before midnight.

"I would like to express all the happiness I am feeling. I am living this moment of happiness with intensity," she said.

Royal, who represents Poitou-Charentes regional council, a rural district in western France, and who is largely untested in electoral politics, emerged as a national candidate last year amid a blizzard of publicity.

Royal, mother of four children and partner of the PS leader Francois Hollande, would lead the opposition Socialist Party challenge at April's election, standing a strong chance of becoming France's first woman president.
