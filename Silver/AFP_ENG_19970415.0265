Serbs in Eastern Slavonia, the last Serb-held part of Croatia, were still voting Tuesday at one polling station in the region after problems with ballot papers Sunday and Monday, a UN spokesman said.

UN spokesman Douglas Coffman told AFP that the polling station in the village of Klisa was open from 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) to 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) to allow the 250 people there to vote.

He said that incorrect ballot papers had been delivered the day before. Aside from this polling stations, all others closed on Monday, some staying open late, he said.

Problems with late arrival of ballot papers and incomplete voter registration lists dogged the UN-organised local, regional and upper house polls in the region.

Voting had been due to end Sunday, as in the rest of Croatia, but had to be extended in the light of the chaos.

The vote will be a key step in returning Eastern Slavonia, captured by Serbs in bitter fighting in 1991, to Croatian control.

Coffman said that UN was pleased at the way the vote had gone.

"We were pleased with the extremely high turnout and the conditions of calm, quiet and security which prevailed throughout the two days of voting," he said, speaking by telephone from Vukovar, the main town of the region.

"We are glad that we believe that everyone who became eligible to vote was able to vote," he said.

Coffman said that he hoped counting would be finished by Wednesday, but said the vote would not be certified until later in the week.
