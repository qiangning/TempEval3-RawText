It's still possible that the death sentence given to five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor for the infection of hundreds of Libyan children with HIV-AIDS will never be carried out.

Libya's supreme court could call off the execution, legal experts in Tripoli said Wednesday. Or it could be averted if a deal on financial compensation is struck with the families of the affected children.

The six condemned to death Monday had been accused of deliberately infecting 426 children with HIV while they were working at Al-Fateh hospital in Benghazi, Libya's second city on the Mediterranean coast, in the late 1990s.

More than 50 of the youngsters have since died.

The so-called Benghazi Six -- in detention for the past seven years -- had previously been tried and sentenced to die before a firing squad, before a retrial was ordered.

A Libyan lawyer explained Wednesday: "The case now will be automatically referred to the supreme court, which will re-examine it in depth, enabling the defence to present its arguments once more.

"That would be a positive thing," he said.

If the supreme court upholds the verdict, the case would go on to a superior judicial council where a panel of judges would have the power to "reduce, uphold or annul" the harsh sentence, he added.

In addition, Libya and Bulgaria have an extradition agreement that could see the nurses serving time in prison at home in lieu of execution in Libya, the lawyer said.

Defence lawyer Othman al-Bizanti confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that his side would be going to the supreme court to lodge an appeal.

"The court considers that they are guilty. We consider that they are innocent. It was for that reason that the supreme court was established, to judge such cases," he said.

Monday's verdict triggered an international outcry, with Germany -- which takes over the presidency of the European Union on January 1, the day Bulgaria joins the block -- vowing to maintain pressure on Tripoli.

Supporters of the Benghazi Six argue that hygiene at the hospital was poor before the accused started work there, and that the children were likely infected with unsterilized and previously used medical instruments.

Besides judicial procedures, the question of compensation could result in the lives of the medics being spared.

Saleh Abdelsalam, director of the Kadhafi Foundation, a benevolent group headed by a son of Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi, stressed the need to "reactivate Europe's contribution" to a compensation fund that would enable a deal with families of the affected children.

Bulgaria, in partnership with the European Union, the United States and Britain, created in December 2005 an international fund to help Libya combat AIDS, improve standards at the Benghazi hospital and compensate families.

"Reactiving the fund has become very urgent, now that the verdict has come down, because it will be a tool to meet the goals (treatment and compensation) concerning the children and their families," he said.

According to a judicial source, a deal with the families would mean that they accept "blood money" in lieu of the execution of the accused.
