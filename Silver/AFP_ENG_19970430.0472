Egypt's most famous belly dancer, Fifi Abdu, has received a 15-percent tax cut from the government for wear and tear on her most exposed asset, her midriff.

"As we do for all belly dancers, we granted Fifi Abdu a 15-percent reduction in taxes every year for wear on her stomach, which is the tool of her work," an Egyptian tax official told AFP.

"But the reduction offered to her is much greater than that of her colleagues because of the great amount of money she earns," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Fifi Abdu took in 4.5 million Egyptian pounds (1.32 million dollars) between 1993 and 1996, according to the Egyptian government weekly Al- Mussawar.

She dances in extravagant costumes backed by a large orchestra, usually for select audiences willing to pay top dollar.

Egyptian singers such as Amr Diab also have received tax breaks of 10 to 15 percent for wear and tear on their voices.
