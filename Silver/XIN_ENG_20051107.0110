China's spacemen Yang Liwei, Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng, together with another 11 Chinese astronauts, have enrolled in China's prestigious Tsinghua University as graduate students, China Central Television reported on Monday.

Given permission by the Ministry of Education, the university's School of Aerospace has given the astronauts an offer of admission at a two-year program on astronautic engineering, according to the report.

Authorities said the university will not compromise their graduating qualifications for astronaut's standing, noting that the astronauts must pass exams and oral defense to acquire degrees.
