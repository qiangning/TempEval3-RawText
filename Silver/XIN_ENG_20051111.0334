South Korea's second largest city, Busan, is aiming to become an international convention host city through the successful hosting of this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, city planners said Saturday.

Busan, also the country's largest port city, was designated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as an international convention city last month, and city authorities plan to update infrastructure to make Busan even more attractive for conventions. The new status allows the city to receive central government assistance and legal support.

"Conventions are a high-value-added business that can also help transform the city's image from a bustling port to one where people can hold meetings while taking the time to enjoy scenic vistas," a Busan city official said.

He added that if the city can play host to the leaders of 21 economies and countless officials and reporters, as well as host sideline events, it can hold any convention in the world.

Other experts said the city has great growth potential, with attractive beaches in Haeundae and Gwangalli, as well as parks including Yongdusan and Taejongdae and the Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Sanctuary.

In addition, to splash new green space o the urban landscape, three new parks have been opened to celebrate the hosting of the 2005 APEC summit. They are the Dongbaek Park, APEC Naru Park and Peace Park.

The city, which is one of the five busiest ports in the world, has an international airport for easy access and is linked to Seoul by air and the KTX, the country's bullet train service.

The city boasts first-class hotels in both the downtown area and Haeundae district and at the Busan Exhibition and Convention Center(BEXCO). BEXCO has an exhibition space of 26,508 square meters and an additional 13,233 square meters for outdoor displays.

The facility has a convention hall that can hold 5,800 people and has played host to various international events, including the official draw for the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in South Korea.

In addition, the new Nurimaru APEC House is expected to become a tourist attraction and valuable asset in terms of getting people to hold conferences in the city. The structure near Haeundae Beach, the venue for the second summit session for APEC leaders on Nov. 19, has a striking view of the ocean.
