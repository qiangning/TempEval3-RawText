The Burmese government has expressed its "sincere appreciation" for the "support and understanding" of ASEAN in planning to admit Burma to the regional group, the official press said Wednesday.

Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw made the comments Tuesday at a meeting of Burmese and ASEAN officials here, a week after the US imposed an investment ban on Burma and appealed to the regional grouping to bar Rangoon's admittance.

"We are indebted to the ASEAN secretariat, as well as to our ASEAN friends" for their support, Ohn Gyaw said, adding Tuesday's consultative meeting served to provide a vital link between Burma and the ASEAN countries.

"It illustrates the kind encouragement on the part of our ASEAN friends, as well as our sincere commitment regarding Myanmar's (Burma's) membership," Ohn Gya was quoted as saying in the New Light of Myanmar.

He did not, however, mention the investment ban on US companies in Burma, which was announced by Washington a week ago in response to the junta's continued repression of the pro-democracy opposition.

Most of the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have already rebuffed the US appeal to bar Burma's entry into the group, which is expected to occur later this year.

ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia and Laos are slated to join the grouping at the same time as Burma.

Ohn Gyaw said Burma had already established a national ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) unit and an ASEAN core group in the foreign ministry as part of its plans to accede to the grouping as a full member.

Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn said Tuesday that the admittance of Burma, Cambodia and Laos would be determined by their readiness to observe the obligations of ASEAN membership.

These obligations include an ability to accede to AFTA, under which trade barriers in the region would be dismantled over the next decade.
