Rebel leader Laurent Kabila has agreed to historic face-to-face talks with Zaire's embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko aboard a South African naval vessel Friday, rebel officials told AFP.

Sources close to the negotiators made the comments Wednesday in this rebel-held city, Zaire's second largest, after US envoy Bill Richardson announced in the capital Kinshasa that Mobutu would attend the talks.

"I am pleased to announce that President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila have agreed to face-to-face talks," Richardson said.

"This is a historic occasion that hopefully will lead to a peaceful transition in Zaire.

"There are no pre-conditions," he added.
