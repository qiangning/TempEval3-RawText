Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will seek to bolster European support for Israel during a trip to Berlin and Rome this week amid fears here that the United States, its main ally, may soon shift course in the Middle East.

Olmert will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday and his Italian counterpart Romano Prodi the following day in Rome.

It is Olmert's first visit to the two countries since taking office last May. Following his meeting with Prodi, Olmert is to be received at the Vatican by Pope Benedict XVI.

Israel is ready to recognize a "European role" in reviving the peace process -- dormant for six years since the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada -- provided Europe continues to boycott the Hamas-led Palestinian government, Olmert spokeswoman Miri Eisin told AFP.

"Germany, Italy and Europe in general have a role to play to advance the peace process," Eisin said. "But there cannot be any recognition of the Hamas government as long as this movement does not recognize Israel and does not give up its mission to destroy it."

The so-called Middle East Quartet -- composed of the EU, United States, Russia and the United Nations -- has demanded that Hamas renounce violence, recognize Israel and agree to abide by past peace deals, before resuming direct aid to the Palestinian government.

Another senior Israel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Olmert would ask Berlin and Rome "to stand against trivial peace initiatives," a veiled reference to a recent proposal by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.

That initiative, which was not well received by Israel, called for an immediate suspension of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, a prisoner exchange and an international peace conference.

Eisin said Olmert will ask the European heavyweights to back economic sanctions against Iran if the Islamic republic continues its nuclear program, which Tehran says is for civilian purposes but which the West fears is a cover for atomic weapons ambitions.

Israel, widely considered the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear power, considers Iran its arch-foe because of repeated statements by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Jewish state should be wiped off the map.

Italy is due to take over in February the leadership of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which was beefed up after the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in July and August.

As part of the UN force, German navy ships have been patrolling the Lebanese coast to prevent any arms smuggling into the country.

Olmert's trip comes on the heels of an influential US report that urged Washington to boost its efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, saying it was key to achieving American goals in the region, including Iraq.

Olmert has rejected the link, but the report has raised fears that the Jewish state's main and most powerful ally could change direction in the Middle East as a result.
