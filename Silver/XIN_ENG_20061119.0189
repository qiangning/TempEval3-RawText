Eighty-eight flights to Los Angeles were postponed because of thick fog in the area Saturday night, said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Thick fog along the coast caused delays of up to an hour and a half at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for planes from around the country, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said on Sunday.

Visibility at the airport was reduced to 0.25 mile to 1.25 miles, and the fog was not expected to lift until this morning, according to the National Weather Service.

There is only one operational runway at LAX that is equipped with an instrument landing system that can guide arriving airplanes in thick fog, said Gregor.

"Normally, around this time, we'd have an arrival rate of 58 to 60 planes an hour. Right now the arrival rate is 32 to 42," Gregor said.

By 9:30 p.m., conditions had improved and the landing rate had increased to about 52 an hour, he said.

The heavy fog was triggered by a combination of warm temperatures Saturday and the cooler moist air coming from the ocean, said Jamie Meier, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

Visibility was expected to remain less than 2 miles overnight.
