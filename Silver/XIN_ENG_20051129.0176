Former South African deputy president Jacob Zuma Tuesday declined to comment on an ongoing investigation against him led by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) over allegations of rape, saying that he would reserve comment until after the investigation had been completed.

A number of media reports had speculated that Zuma would announce his resignation as deputy president of the ruling ANC on Tuesday should he be charged formally.

A media release issued by lawyer Michael Hulley on behalf of Zuma said that they'd been advised by members of the South African Police Service that the investigation into the alleged rape remained incomplete, and that more time was warranted in order to complete the investigation under the direction of the NPA.

"We acknowledge that the SAPS are the appropriate agency to deal with allegations of such a serious nature and that they should be allowed to complete their work free from interference and speculation.

"In the circumstances, Zuma, out of respect for due process, will reserve any further comment on the matter until such time as the SAPS have completed their work."

"We feel that such an approach is in keeping with the integrity with which the police have dealt with the investigation, in contrast with that of some media organizations," the statement said.

The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) received a docket from the police on allegations last week. It has to decide whether Zuma should be prosecuted.

Immediate comment from the NPA on Zuma's statement was not available.

According to various media reports, a 31-year-old woman said she was raped at Zuma's house in Forest Town, Johannesburg, in early November.

Zuma has denied the rape allegation. He goes to court in July next year to defend himself against charges of corruption, which he has also denied.

Many of Zuma's supporters believe there is a campaign against him to stop him becoming the next president of the African National Congress.
