The unrest in Iraq is "much worse" than a civil war, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan told the BBC in an interview to be broadcast Monday.

He said some Iraqis rightly thought they were worse off than under dictator Saddam Hussein, ousted from power after US-led forces invaded in March 2003.

The UN chief voiced his regrets over the invasion, saying it could have been stopped had UN weapons inspectors been given more time to conduct their work, and he added that the wounds had still not healed in the UN.

Turning to Iran, Annan said the UN needed to do whatever it could to resolve the stand-off over Tehran's nuclear programme through negotiations.

And the Ghanaian vowed to prioritise Darfur in his final month in office, even though the international community had neither "the resources or the will" to confront the crisis in the western region of Sudan.

On the sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in Iraq, Annan said: "When we had the strife in Lebanon and other places, we called that a civil war -- this is much worse," he said.

Last Tuesday, Annan had suggested that the international community hold a broad-based international peace conference to find a way out of the vicious struggle that has plunged Iraq into bloodshed.

But Iraqi President Jalal Talabani on Sunday rejected the idea, apparently leaving it dead in the water.

"It is an extremely dangerous situation and I think we all are interested in getting Iraq right and we would want to get it right, but the Iraqis will have to come together and make it happen," Annan said.

"They are going to need help; given the killings and the bitterness I'm not sure they can do it alone. They would need help from the international community and their neighbours."

He added: "I really believed that we could have stopped the war and that if we had worked a bit harder, given the inspectors a bit more time, we could have."

Citizens who say conditions were better under president Saddam "are right in the sense of the average Iraqi's life", he said.

"If I were an average Iraqi obviously I would make the same comparison, that they had a dictator who was brutal but they had their streets, they could go out, their kids could go to school and come back home without a mother or father worrying, 'Am I going to see my child again?'

"And the Iraqi government has not been able to bring the violence under control. The society needs security and a secure environment for it to get on -- without security not much can be done -- not recovery or reconstruction."

Asked about the impasse in negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme and the chances of military action, Annan said he did not think the Middle East could "take another crisis".

"It's in a very precarious and delicate state at this moment and I have indicated quite clearly that on the Iranian issue we need to do whatever we can to get a negotiated solution and that, in my mind, is the only one."

A military solution would be "extremely unwise for that country and for the world and everything should be done to stop it."

Turning to Darfur, where ethnic violence has killed hundreds of thousands of people and left millions homeless, Annan said the situation was "deeply disappointing" as Khartoum has rejected a plan to allow UN peacekeepers in.

"It's tragic but we do not have the resources or the will to confront the situation -- as in, if you did it, would you make the situation worse, or would it be better?"

He said the Sudanese government would be held "individually and collectively responsible for what is happening and what happens".

Annan's second term in office expires at the end of the year, when former South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki-Moon will take over.
