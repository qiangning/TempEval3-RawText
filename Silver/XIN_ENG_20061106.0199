A record number of overseas visitors came to Albania in the past summer, reaching well over 550,000 people, an Albanian official said on Monday.

Eris Hozha, director of the National Tourism Organization, explained that the increasing numbers of visitors are attracted by Albania's well reserved cultural heritage.

"Albania is home to the internationally renowned archeological sites, such as the Butrint National Park, the country's Stone City of Gjirokastra and its 2500-year-old city of Berati," he said, adding that Berati is expected to be granted World Heritage site status in 2007.

He said that after the new terminal at the Tirana International Airport is completed in early 2007, an even greater number of visitors will come to Albania.

Albania is a small, mountainous country, boasting some of the wildest mountain scenery in Europe. It has a least built-up coastline of 150 miles in the Mediterranean region.
