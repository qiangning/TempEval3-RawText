A former shoeshine boy who rose from abject poverty, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 61, has given up his once fiery leftist rhetoric but not his image as a champion of the underdog.

The bearded leader will take office on Monday after his overwhelming reelection with more than 60 percent of the vote on October 29, thanks largely to support from the millions of Brazilians who survive on less than two dollars a day.

His electoral victory in the run-off marked a clear rebound since claims of campaign dirty tricks had thwarted his bid to win reelection in the first round of voting on October 1, when he fell 1.4 percentage points short of the simple majority needed for outright victory.

At campaign rallies, he showed great pride in his humble background, reminding cheering crowds that unlike his opponent, a trained doctor, he has no university degree.

Born on October 6, 1945, in the dirt-poor northeast of Brazil, Lula learned to read when he was 10.

As a child, he worked as a shoeshine boy and a peanut vendor before getting a job as a metal worker at the age of 14. He lost a finger in a work accident in the 1960s.

A trade unionist and strike leader, he came to symbolize opposition to the military dictatorship in the 1970s and early 1980s. He founded the leftist Workers Party (PT) in February 1980.

In 1986, he was elected to Congress, and three years later he launched his first bid for the presidency. He tried again in 1994 and 1998 before winning by a landslide in 2002.

His victory was in part attributed to the fact that he dramatically toned down his once fiery leftist speech and moved the PT closer to the political center.

"I don't know how many elections I've lost to get to where I am now," Lula said in an October interview. "But I do know how many insults and prejudices I've had to overcome to get there.

"That's why my only objective now is to show that I'm more competent than many of the people who've been runnning this country."

He insists Brazil has made great strides forward since he took office, saying poverty has gone down 19 percent since he took office.

His government pumped billions of dollars into social projects, including an ambitious program that subsidizes 11 million impoverished families, and which has gained widespread popularity.

His electoral triumph four years ago rocked financial markets that feared he would lead the country to economic ruin. Lula eventually gained the markets' trust, as he kept the economy stable and achieved the budget surplus required by agreements with the International Monetary Fund.

"In four years, I have learned a lot," he says.

His popularity plummeted in 2005 amid a wave of corruption scandals involving members of his cabinet and his party. He quickly bounced back, but a new scandal that erupted two weeks before the first round of voting again eroded his support, which has surged once more in recent weeks.

Lula fired top government and party officials, and insists he had no prior knowledge of the wrongdoing.

He has distanced himself from the brand of radicalism advocated by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who in his recent address to the UN General Assembly called US President George W. Bush "the devil."

An avowed admirer of the Cuban revolution, he nonetheless recently criticized Cuba's ailing President Fidel Castro.

"I only regret that Fidel Castro did not carry out a process of political opening," he recently told the Folha de Sao Paulo daily.

"I think that our (Cuban) comrades missed their chance to move closer to democracy," he said.

Lula is married and has three children.
