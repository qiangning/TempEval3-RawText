The Philippines and the United States are near a decision on changing the accounting rate for long-distance telephone calls between the two countries, it was announced here Wednesday.

Art Samson, senior vice-president of Philippine Long Distance and Telephone Co. (PLDT), said PLDT and the US firm, American Telephone and Telegraph (AT et T), may reach a decision this month on lowering the accounting rate over five years.

Samson said the negotiations would likely result in an agreement to lower the US-Philippine telephone rates from the present one dollar a minute to about 38 cents.

Samson said they may agree to a 10 to 15 percent reduction every year until the 38-cent rate is reached.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Philippine National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) set the parameters for the PLDT-AT et T talks which will be a benchmark for all other US and Philippine carriers.

The FCC has been pressing other countries to lower the accounting rate of long-distance calls between them and the United States in order to bring down the cost borne by US consumers.

However the NTC has said this will threaten the viability of Philippine telephone companies since they rely on international calls for most of their profits.

The NTC has said several new telephone companies that have sprung up in recent years following the deregulation of the industry would be particularly hit since they had expected their international operations to subsidize local expansion.

As part of an effort to make Philippine carriers less dependent on international services, the NTC is considering proposals to raise long-distance domestic rates.

The NTC is also considering a system of metering all telephone calls, instead of the flat rate that most Filipinos are charged.

Samson said PLDT relies on international calls for 56 percent of its income but that this will eventually go down to 33 percent when the rates are changed.

PLDT president Antonio Cojuangco said in a speech at the PLDT annual stockholders meeting Wednesday that the company had already prepared for the rate change.

Cojuangco said PLDT, which has 1.52 million telephone lines, would add another 1.7 million lines and change to a purely digital system by 2000.

PLDT posted a net income of 6.44 billion pesos (247 million dollars) in 1996, up 8.8 percent from its 1995 figure.
