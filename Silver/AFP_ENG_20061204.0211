European aircraft manufacturer Airbus is holding talks with partner European governments but no decision on state finance for the new A350 airliner programme is imminent, the head of Airbus said on Monday.

Airbus chief executive Louis Gallois, who is also co-chief executive of parent company EADS, told a press conference that "no decision has been taken or is imminent" concerning a contribution by partner countries to the A350 programme.

Gallois said: "We do not have an imminent need for finance."

He also said: "The board of EADS has asked us to study all possible instruments for financing ... A capital increase is one of them, but only one possibility."

A short time earlier French Economy and Finance Minister Thierry Breton had said that the four partner countries behind the Airbus programme, France, Germany, Spain and Britain, would accompany financing of the A350 programme.

The board of the European Aernoautic Defence and Space Company EADS decided late on Friday to go ahead with the programme to build the A350 series of airliners.

The aircraft was considered to be crucial to the future of Airbus as the main competitor to US manufacturer Boeing, but Airbus is in difficulties over delays of up to 24 months in its other key new programme, for the A380 superjumbo airliner.

Airbus has announced ambitious plans to save money, in part to release funds for the A350 project, but has yet to provide full details of how it will restructure.
