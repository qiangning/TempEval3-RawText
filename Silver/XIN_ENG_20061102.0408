Stepping on the turf of Beijing is exciting for Axmed Saggar. Like many of his country folks, the reporter of Puntland TV from Somali had only sciolistic knowledge of China, mostly from the roads and hospitals built with assistance from Chinese expatriates.

"Somalians don't know much about China. We have very limited access to information of the modern country, " said Saggar who came to Beijing to cover a historical summit to be attended by President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed of Somali.

Leaders of more than 40 African countries have been invited to participate in the Beijing Summit of Forum on Sino-Africa Cooperation scheduled for Nov. 4-5, which is described as the grandest diplomatic event in China since 1950s.

Recalling a photo show featuring Chairman Mao Zedong staged in Somali while he was young, Saggar said in the eyes of most Somalians, "China has always been a friend."

The relationship between China and Africa is time-cemented. Six hundred years ago, famous mariner Zheng He (1371-1435) of the Ming Dynasty led the then largest fleet in the world and made voyages to Africa. He brought there tea, chinaware, silk and technology, and took back spice and local specialties. Not an inch of land was ever occupied.

"Zheng He and Jackie Chan (a contemporary Hong Kong movie star) are both quite well-known in Somali," said Saggar.

Over the past 50 years, China has offered economic aid to 53 African countries and canceled 10.9 billion yuan (1.36 billion U.S. dollars) worth of debt. By the end of 2005, China had over 800 enterprises in Africa, involving a total investment of 6 billion dollars, official data revealed.

"Somalians and Chinese expatriates have got along well. A raft of infrastructure facilities including roads and hospitals were built with aid from China," said Saggar.

He hoped President Yusuf's visit to Beijing would "bring more trips between Somali and China".

"Somalians would like to have more cooperation and exchanges with the Chinese in a variety of sectors, especially education, science, technology and economy," he said.

As so much is going on in the world's fourth largest economy, Saggar said Somalians were not only interested in China's history but also appealed by its robust development.

Saggar's view was shared by many African reporters. Kato Jacob from President Press of Uganda said, "We wish to hear more voices from China, especially stories about China told by the Chinese."

Nearly 300 African reporters were expected to cover the two- day summit highlighting "friendship, peace, cooperation and development".
