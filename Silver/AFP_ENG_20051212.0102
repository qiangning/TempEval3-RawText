Between 20 and 30 people were arrested early Monday in the Paris region under an investigation into the funding of Islamist extremists, officials said.

Investigators believe some of the detainees are active in organised crime and have carried out armed robberies to raise money for Islamist groups, the officials said.

The suspects were under surveillance for several weeks and were detained after evidence emerged that "violent actions" were being planned, the officials added.
