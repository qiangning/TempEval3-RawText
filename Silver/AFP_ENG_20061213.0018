US Representative Dennis Kucinich, an outspoken opponent of the Iraq war, has entered the already-crowded field of possible contenders for the 2008 presidential election, announcing he will vie for the Democratic party nomination.

Kucinich was a candidate for the 2004 nomination, which was won by Democratic Senator John Kerry. Then as now, the centerpiece of his presidential bid is his strong opposition the the Iraq war.

Considered on the left flank of his party, the avowed pacifist is calling on Congress to cut off funding for the war.

"This is a moment for me to stand up, to show leadership," he told CNN television Tuesday.

A dark horse candidate, Kucinich did not win any primary states in 2004, but raised his profile in Congress and garnered a platform for his antiwar message.

With public disaffection for the Iraq war at an all time high, Kucinich said he believes his antiwar candidacy will resonate with a large number of Americans.

"It's easy in hindsight for candidates so say we shouldn't have gone there. I was right at the forefront," he said.

"People want someone who has that foresight and that's what a leader is about. I can say we can get out of Iraq right now," he said.

"I'm taking a strong stand on this and putting it on the line because I believe the American people want those troops brought home."

The five-time Ohio representative becomes the second Democrat to officially throw his hat in the ring, afer an announcement last month by Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack that he is seeking the nomination.

Several other leading figures are deemed possible candidates, but have yet to declare, including on the Democratic side, Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Evan Bayh, Chris Dodd and Joe Biden.
