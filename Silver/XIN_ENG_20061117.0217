A Beijing court on Friday rejected a Chinese netizen's lawsuit against a software producer and its supplier for alleged "hooligan software" in the country's first verdict on this issue.

The Chaoyang District People's Court of Beijing rejected Dong Haiping's claim for an apology and compensation of 1,094 yuan (138 U.S. dollars) from Inter China Network Software (Beijing) Co., Ltd and the Beijing Alibaba Information Technology Co., Ltd, after he found he could not completely remove their software from his computer.

Dong said he downloaded and installed Yahoo Assistant, software designed to assist the running of Internet Explorer developed by the Inter China (Beijing) from the Yahoo China website and provided by Beijing Alibaba, last August.

Dong claimed that the software could not be fully uninstalled and it always started up automatically when he turned on his computer.

The remaining part of the software damaged the hard disk of his computer and affected its normal use, according to Dong.

The court ruled that Dong did not provide evidence that the software had resulted in the damage of his computer.

Dong's lawyer said they would appeal.

Dong has set up the China Anti-hooligan Software Federation to fight against "hooligan software", including adverts, spyware and malicious software like pornographic information, all of which may pop up uncontrollably and provide backdoors for viruses.
