US President George W. Bush will arrive in South Korea Wednesday, one day before his planned bilateral summit with his South Korean counterpart Roh Moo- hyun, a US Embassy official said Sunday.

Roh and Bush have agreed to meet in the country's southeastern city of Gyeongju on Nov. 17, ahead of the Nov. 18-19 leaders' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said. The forum opened in Busan on Saturday.

The US president is to arrive at Gimhae International Airport, the gateway to this host city of the 13th APEC forum, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Bush is among the 21 Asia-Pacific Rim leaders expected to attend the APEC leaders' meeting.
