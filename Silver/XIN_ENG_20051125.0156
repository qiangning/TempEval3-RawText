Ukrainian prosecutors have delivered a criminal case concerning the murder of journalist Heorhiy Gongadze to the country's Supreme Court, a court spokesman confirmed on Friday.

The case was brought against three former police officers, charged with committing the murder of Gongadze, and the prosecutors requested the court determine where to hear the charges.

The three suspects were Valeriy Kostenko, Mykola Protasov and Oleksandr Popovych. A fourth suspect, Oleksiy Pukach, has absconded.

The Internet jounalist Gongadze, famous for his reports of high-level corruption when Leonid Kuchma held the presidency, was slain in 2000.

The former president Kuchma has denied accusations of his masterminding the murder.

Gongadze's death triggered nationwide demonstrations against the former Kuchma government, leading to last year's Orange Revolution after which the opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko came to power.
