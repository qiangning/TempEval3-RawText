Seven British soldiers accused of beating an Iraqi teenager to death with rifle butts were acquitted on Thursday.

According to the Sky news, a court martial judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict the soldiers.

The men had faced murder and violent disorder charges following the death of 18-year-old Nadhem Abdullah, in May 2003. But all the soldiers, members of The 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, denied the allegations.

Abdullah died in an attack on a group of Iraqi civilians in al- Ferkah, 60 miles north of Basra. The attack was said to have taken place three weeks after formal hostilities in Iraq had ceased.

Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett called some of the evidence "too inherently weak" and directed a military panel in Colchester, Essex, to clear the defendants.

"The judge made clear that, on the basis of the evidence presented, very serious allegations had been made and that it was perfectly proper to take the matter to trial," British Ministry of Defense said in a statement.

"Our soldiers are not above the law. It is right that allegations of this nature must be followed up and the evidence tested in full. This process is now complete and those soldiers still in the Army will now return to Regimental duty," said the statement.

The cleared soldiers are Corporal Scott Evans, 32, Private Billy Nerney, 24, Samuel May, 25, Morne Vosloo, 26, Daniel Harding, 25, Roberto Di-Gregorio and Scott Jackson, 26.
