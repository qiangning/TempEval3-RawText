A large fire broke out Tuesday in a camp for Moslem pilgrims at Mina in Saudi Arabia, burning thousands of tents and forcing a massive evacuation, witnesses and officials said.

Several pilgrims and Saudi civil defense workers were wounded in the blaze, which covered a 25 square kilometer (10 square mile) area, according to witnesses, but there was no official confirmation of the injuries.

"Because of the strong winds, the fire spread north of Mina," the director of Saudi civil defense, General Mohammed ibn Ali al-Sahili, told the official SPA news agency.

The fire, sparked by a gas bottle used for cooking, began at 11:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) Tuesday about five kilometers (three miles) north of Mecca, the home of Islam's holiest shrines, witnesses said.

The blaze was still buring more than five hours later, despite the efforts of civil defense workers backed by helicopters, witnesses said.

The region was closed off by Saudi authorities, and thousands of pilgrims were evacuated to a region outside Mina, where 10,000 tents had to be set up in haste.

Tents occupied by Iranian pilgrims were also burned in the fire, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported in Tehran.

About two million Moslem pilgrims have gathered at Mina to attend the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. The pilgrimage climaxes on nearby Mount Arafat on Wednesday.
