The English Premiership match between Watford and Wigan at Vicarage Road on Saturday was abandoned due to a waterlogged pitch.

Referee Steve Tanner called a halt to proceedings about 15 minutes into the second half with the scores level at 1-1 as rain lashed down.

Emile Heskey had given the visitors the lead before Tamas Priskin headed an equaliser for Watford.
