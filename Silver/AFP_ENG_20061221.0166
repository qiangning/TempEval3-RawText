Azerbaijani officials are to hold talks Friday with Russian gas giant Gazprom over an increase in Russian gas export prices, the head of Azerbaijan's state oil company said Thursday.

"Talks between Azerbaijani government representatives and Gazprom on the issues of the price and volume of delivery of gas will begin in Moscow tomorrow," Rovnag Abdullayev, head of Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR said.

Russia's state gas monopoly Gazprom wants to increase the price for gas sold to Azerbaijan from 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters to 230 dollars as part of a series of price hikes for former Soviet republics.

It also wants to more that halve its annual deliveries of some four billion cubic meters to Azerbaijan, potentially creating a shortage of the fuel in the Caspian state, which has major oil and gas reserves of its own, but suffers from poor infrastructure.

"Azerbaijani consumers will not be left without gas," Abdullayev told journalists during a visit to Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan region.

Azerbaijan has reacted to Gazprom's demands by threatening to cut exports of its own oil through Russian territory, in a move that would deprive Russia of lucrative transit fees.
