All-time great Andre Agassi unexpectedly decided to quit after losing his first match in the Shanghai Masters Cup here on Monday.

"With the state of my ankle right now, there's no chance for me to be able to play again," said Agassi at a post-match news conference, after losing 6-4, 6-2 to Russian tennis upstart Nikolay Davydenko in a Red Group round-robin matchup.

"This is, for me to go out on the court to play like this, nobody wants to see it," added the oldest player in the ATP finale. "It's very dangerous and risky for my future to be ready for anything in the next four or five weeks. So this is just an unfortunate setback."

The 35-year-old played totally "un-Agassi" tennis in his first showdown on Monday of this year's Masters Cup, being broken for three times against five aces from his 24-year-old opponent.

His sluggish form, however, has no show in statistics of match, where Agassi committed 3 double faults and 23 unforced errors against 14 winners and Davydenko cracked just two more winners against 2 double-fault and 27 unforced errors.

Besides fitness problem, Agassi imputed his lack of form to long absence from the court.

"When you haven't played in so long, I couldn't really hit balls for a couple of months because of my sprained ankle," said the United States native, who qualified for his fifth Tennis Masters Cup in six years and finished in top ten for 16th time this season in his 20-year career.

"Just from serving, in the last week of trying to get ready, it was just a little stiff and sore. But the movement is more of an issue."

The eight-time Grand Slam winner, ranked 5th in the ATP Entry Rankings, ruled out an unexpected bad status, and said: "Last few days, it's arguably not getting worse, so I have to try and see and give it a chance to push through.

"But it has way too much effect on my movement. I'm scared to hurt it worse. It's still very painful, especially after 35, 40 minutes of being on the court.

"It doesn't do anybody any good for me to be out there, except for my opponents. That's it," he added.

Agassi's withdrawal came just minutes after Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal pulled out due to left foot injury.

"I just heard that tonight. That's terrible. I hope his injury is something that doesn't last very long, because it's just been terrible this year for the amount of players that haven't been ready to play here."

He complained the tough schedule of ATP Tours, saying that "It's probably a sign that things need to change somewhere for guys to feel better about their physical ability to get ready for a tournament this big. It's the end of a long year and it's not easy. It's very unfortunate."
