The South African rand was steady in late trade on Monday despite a weaker euro, supported by two-way trade and a stronger gold price which was at a 18-year high.

At 15:40 (1340 GMT), the rand was bid at 6.5160 per dollar from Friday's close of 6.4940 and Thursday's close of 6.5011.

It was bid at 7.6386 to the euro from Friday's close of 7.6163 and Thursday's close of 7.6875 and at 11.1090 against sterling from a previous 11.1052 and Thursday's 11.2023.

Traders said that gold, which seems once again to be eyeing the key 500 US dollars per ounce level, would lend support to the local currency.

At 15:40 (1340 GMT), gold was quoted at 495.60 dollars a troy ounce, having earlier traded at an 18-year high of 499.14 dollars per ounce.
