The annual pilgrimage to Mecca drew to a close on Saturday as frantic relatives awaited news of the 343 pilgrims killed in a huge blaze four days earlier.

Some two million pilgrims who spent a week praying at Islam's holiest sites began to leave Mecca, birthplace of the Prophet Mohammad, for the western city of Jeddah to catch planes, buses and boats home.

They spent their last day here walking round the Kaaba from dawn. The Kabaa is a square building constructed around a black stone, traditionally brought to earth from paradise by the Archangel Gabriel.

Saudi officials said 343 pilgrims were killed in an enormous fire Tuesday which swept through their camp at Mina, just south of Mecca.

Most were from India and other Asian countries, Indian officials said.

The Saudi authorities announced Saturday that another 1,537 pilgrims were injured in the inferno which incinerated 70,000 tents, with 25 of them still in hospital and some in a coma.

However, they were yet to announce the identities of the victims.

An advisor to the Saudi interior ministry, Saed al-Arabi al-Harshi, said Saturday that "the fire destroyed everything" in the pilgrims' camp.

"Identification is difficult and will take time because some bodies are badly charred," he said, quoted by the official Qatari News Agency.

The victims' plastic identity badges, which they are given in exchange for their passports during the week-long pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, were destroyed in the inferno, the official said.
