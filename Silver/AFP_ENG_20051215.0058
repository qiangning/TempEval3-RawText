Philippine police detained Thursday a former defence secretary who had declared himself president and urged the armed forces to withdraw their support for President Gloria Arroyo.

Retired general Fortunato Abat, 80, was bundled into an unmarked police van and taken in for questioning with two other members of his self-proclaimed cabinet to face possible charges of inciting sedition, the authorities said.

There was no indication that either the military or the public were taking Abat's call to overthrow Arroyo very seriously, although rumours of a coup plot have been rife for weeks in Manila.

"There can only be one president," said police spokesman Leopoldo Bataoil.

Though the government had considered Abat more of a nuisance than a security threat, Arroyo's chief aide, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita told reporters: "We have to do something because we cannot let the people feel there is a violation of law and nothing is being done."

Abat had urged the military and the public to support calls for the ouster of Arroyo, who survived an impeachment vote in the legislature in September over allegations she cheated to win the May 2004 presidential election.

Abat failed to rally popular support and the military said they stayed loyal to Arroyo, who survived a military uprising in 2003.

Abat's son, a middle-level officer in the Philippine Army, was relieved of his post as deputy commander of a brigade deployed north of Manila, the military said Thursday.

Colonel Victor Abat was accused by superiors of sending mobile telephone text messages that supposedly urged other military officers to join acts of "destabilization" that the military would not specify.

"I have deemed it proper to relieve him because he had been spreading text messages enjoining officers and men of the army to join the destabilization move," said army chief Lieutenant General Hermogenes Esperon.

Rumours have swirled in recent days that a new coup plot was being hatched against Arroyo whose approval rating has plunged to record lows due to a six-month campaign from the opposition to oust her.

These rumours have grown after a Marine officer, Marine Captain Nicanor Faeldon, facing charges for a foiled mutiny against Arroyo in 2003, escaped Wednesday shortly after a court hearing.

Arroyo spokesman Ignacio Bunye charged that his escape was "well-planned and well-coordinated."

"We believe that he is now being coddled by some shadowy groups and personalities for their self-serving destabilization activities," Bunye said.

He did not identify the groups although in the past the government has said members of the opposition had been involved in efforts to destabilize Arroyo.

Meanwhile, Ermita said Arroyo met with senior military commanders late Wednesday on her return from an East Asian summit in Malaysia.

"We cannot be too complacent about reports that we have received and (discussed) actions that have to be done," he added.
