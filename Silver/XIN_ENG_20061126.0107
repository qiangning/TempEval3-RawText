Chinese Ministry of Culture on Sunday reiterated regulations on entertainment places, noting that new entertainment places can not be set up in residential compounds or historical buildings.

During the enforcement of regulations on the administration of entertainment places, which took effect in March, several problems have emerged and need to be clarified, an official with the ministry told Xinhua.

Newly-approved entertainment places can not be established in residential compounds, museums, libraries or historical buildings under cultural relics protection, said the official, quoting a guideline recently issued by the ministry on enforcing the regulations.

Such places are also banned in crowded places such as railway stations and airports, or inside or near schools, hospitals and government departments. They can only be set up on the ground floor or the first floor underground.

The guideline also sets minimum coverage of area for new KTVs and dancing places, which is 200 square meters with each compartment of eight square meters.

The establishment of any entertainment places must be known by the public and go through public hearings. Representatives from nearby residential committees or schools, hospitals, government departments and stores of dangerous chemicals should be informed to attend the hearings.

Administrators of entertainment places would be punished if they failed to set up archives for their staff or keep business notes, or they are found to have been involved in illegal activities, noted the official.

Apart from the guideline, in the regulations issued by the State Council, civil servants are prohibited from running or getting involved in the management of entertainment places.

It also bans electronic gaming facilities possessing gamble functions in entertainment places, and the use of pirated audio and video products.
