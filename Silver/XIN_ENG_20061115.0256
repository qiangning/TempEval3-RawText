The Zambian government would soon enforce a law to limit the speed of public transportation vehicles, local media reported on Wednesday.

The law would demand all public transport operators to equip their vehicles with a speed limiter, reports said.

Esther Nkandu, chairman of the Road Transportation and Safety Agency, told a meeting on Tuesday that the government was currently in the process of implementing the law.

The law would be enforced with the help of 500 newly recruited traffic police officers who are about to be deployed around the country, Nkandu said.

The public transportation operators, however, argued that the law should not be imposed only on public transportation vehicles, insisting that it must be extended to all vehicles on the road.
