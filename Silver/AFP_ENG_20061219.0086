The United States and North Korea Tuesday held their first direct talks on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons since multilateral disarmament negotiations resumed here after a 13-month break, officials said.

"The US and North Korean delegations are meeting this afternoon," a spokesman at the Chinese press center for the six-nation talks told AFP.

A South Korean official confirmed that chief US envoy Christopher Hill had met directly with his counterpart from North Korea, Kim Kye-Gwan.
