The White House hailed the Zairean peace talks announced Wednesday as major progress toward ending the civil war and paving the way toward democratic rule.

"This is a very significant step forward in our goal of attempting to mediate a resolution of the conflict between the two factions," White House spokesman Michael McCurry said.

Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko will meet with rebel leader Laurent Kabila Friday for their first face-to-face talks on board a South African ship in a deal brokered by the US mediator, UN Ambassador William Richardson.

"Our hope, of course, is that discussions can lead to some cease-fire, to a suspension of the violence that has led to the displacement of so many refugees and so many deaths of innocent civilians in Zaire," McCurry said.

Kabila's rebels have captured more than half the country since they launched their offensive over six months ago to topple Mobutu, who has ruled Zaire for 32 years.

McCurry added that the United States also hopes "these discussions will begin the transitional process that can lead to a government that will be elected in free and fair elections."
