Uzbekistan have withdrawn from the inaugural Asian Hopman Cup in India to focus on the 15th Asian Games, the organisers said on Wednesday.

Philippines have replaced Uzbekistan in the mixed team event starting on Thursday whose winners qualify for the Hopman Cup to be held in Perth, Australia from Dec. 30.

Hosts India, China and Japan have been drawn in Group A and Chinese Taipei, Thailand and Philippines in Group B.

The two group winners will meet in Sunday's final.
