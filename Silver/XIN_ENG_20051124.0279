The European Union (EU) and Canada signed an agreement on Thursday, facilitating Canada's participation in EU crisis management operations.

The agreement was signed by EU's foreign and security policy chief Javier Solana and Canadian ambassador Jeremy Kinsman in the margins of an EU-Canada leaders' video-conference.

Until now, Canada's participation in EU-led crisis management operations has been on ad hoc basis.

Canada has participated or is currently involved in several EU- led operations in Bosnia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
