The annual 30th Cairo International Film Festival will be held from Nov. 28 to Dec. 8, with some 19 films from 16 countries to be shown.

Chinese film "The Road", directed by Zhang Jiarui, will be among the films for competition. Three Egyptian films and two Mexican films will also be shown at the festival.

According to a press release by the organizer, there will be a five-member international jury led by Egyptian director and writer Daoud Abdel Sayed during the festival.

The film festival will be held with a series of form and content reforms as the festival's logo being changed from "The Pyramid" to "The Pharaonic Life Key" while the prizes also being changed to "the Golden Life Key", "the Silver Life Key" and "the Bronze Life Key".

Another remarkable change of this year's film festival was the guest of honor, not a sole country, but a whole continent -- the Latin America.

In recent years, France, Italy and China were honored at the festival for their outstanding contributions to the Seventh Art ( the art of cinema) during the past century.

Furthermore, this year's film festival will hold a conference on anti-piracy, during which the current practices of film piracy, ways to reduce its harmful impact on investors and consumers, and the economic growth process will be discussed.
