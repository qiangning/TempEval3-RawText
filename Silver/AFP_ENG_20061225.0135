The leader of the world's Anglicans on Monday urged the international community not to ignore the problems in the Middle East amid continued stalemate in the peace process and intra-Palestinian violence.

In his Christmas Day sermon, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams spoke of his recent visit to the region with other senior British Christian leaders and likened the troubles there to those facing all humankind.

He said it was "chilling" that neither Palestinians nor Israelis were hopeful of an imminent political settlement, despite a meeting this week of Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

But he said the world should put politics to one side in determining who deserved support, saying both sides were impoverished in different ways.

For Israel, that meant the continuing legacy Jewish people's troubled history as persecuted "largely unwelcome guests among other nations" and the effects of the severe economic crisis gripping the Palestinian territories.

"As soon as we try to sort out which we give the advantage to we shall be deciding to some extent who we're against; and that will undoubtedly create another round of poverty and anger and bitterness...

"Both deserve the best. And the best we can give them in such circumstances is at least the assurance of friendship.

"Go and see, go and listen; let them know, Israelis and Palestinians alike, that they will be heard and not forgotten," he told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral in southeast England.

Williams, the Church of England's most senior cleric, said both communities dreaded the prospect of the world turning its back on them, likening the problems there to those closer to home.

"The tragedies of the Holy Land are not the problems of exotic barbarians far away. They are signs of the underlying tragedies that cripple all human life, individual and collective," he said.

"Every wall we build to defend ourselves and keep out what may destroy us is also a wall that keeps us in and that will change us in ways we did not choose or want.

"Every human solution to fears and threats generates a new set of fears and threats."

Williams said whether it was Israel's controversial security barrier in the West Bank, Britain's planned renewal of its Trident missile nuclear deterrent system or tactics to protect oneself against harm, defences were destructive.

"Defences do something terrible to us as well as to our real and imagined enemies," he said.

Williams's sermon comes after a visit to the West Bank town of Bethlehem -- a place of pilgrimage for Christians because of its significance as the birthplace of Jesus -- to see at firsthand the lives of ordinary Palestinians.

During the trip, he described the Israeli-built security barrier that surrounds the town as symbolising what was "deeply wrong in the human heart".

On Saturday, he launched a strongly worded attack in The Times newspaper against Britain and its allies' "short-sighted" and "ignorant" policy in Iraq, which he said was putting Christians in the Middle East at risk.

He warned that Christians could be chased out of the region because they were now being viewed by their countrymen as "supporters of the crusading West".

His comments were backed by the Muslim Council of Britain umbrella group but the British government said it was not its policies, but "intolerant extremism" of those bent on causing pain, suffering and chaos which was to blame.
