Air France, Malaysia Air and Britain's Virgin Atlantic Airways are among eight finalist bidders for South Africa's domestic Sun Air, Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau told journalists Tuesday.

The other finalists, out of an original 16 bidders, include various groupings representing combinations of domestic airlines, trade unions, financial institutions and black business consortiums, the minister said.

Virgin has teamed up with six black empowerment groups, including the National Empowerment Corporation (NEC), which last year made headlines by purchasing a controlling share in Johnnic, the subsidiary investment firm of mining giant Anglo American.

Air France and Air Malaysia have launched independent bids without local partners for Sun Air, a para-statal company created during the apartheid era.

President Nelson Mandela's government launched an ambition privatisation programme in 1995, which culminated in the selling of a partial share of national Telkom to a group including Telekom Malaysia and Texas-based SBC Communications.
