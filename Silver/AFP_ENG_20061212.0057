An Israeli minister on Tuesday urged silence on the country's nuclear capability one day after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's remark placing the Jewish state among the world's nuclear powers.

"I would suggest that all those who want to talk about the issue, for God's sake and for the sake of Israel's security, stop it," Infrastructure Minister Benjamin Ben Eliezer told army radio.

On Monday, Olmert said in an interview to German television station N24 Sat1 that Israel was among the states that possess an atomic bomb, breaking a decades-long silence from Israeli officials on the issue.

"Iran openly, explicitly and publicly threatens to wipe Israel off the map. Can you say that this is the same level, when they are aspiring to have nuclear weapons, as France, America, Russia and Israel?" he asked.

Ben Eliezer said he did not believe that Olmert's slip broke the country's "policy of nuclear ambiguity."

"I support the policy of ambiguity and I don't see Olmert's statement as a declaration that Israel has nuclear weapons," he said.

Israel is nevertheless believed to be the only nuclear power in the Middle East, and according to some estimates possesses some 200 nucealr warheads.
