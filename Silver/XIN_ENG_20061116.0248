World number one Roger Federer and nemesis David Nalbandian, who joined hands to advance into semifinals here last year, repeated history by making the semifinals at this year's edition on Thursday.

The duo, who were also grouped in Red and joined to make last four in 2005 finale, got through to the semifinals for the second consecutive year here after beating respective enemies with straight sets in the final round-robin matches.

Federer eased through Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 in one hour and 48 minutes while Argentine Nalbandian needed only one hour and 37 minutes to edge past Andy Roddick 7-2, 7-6 (7-4) in an earlier match.

Thus, Federer finishes first in the Red Group with wins and Nalbandian, who are tied with Ljubicic and Roddick on one win and two losses, places second with set winning advantage by claiming four out of eight sets in total.
