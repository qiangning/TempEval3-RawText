WTO Director General Pascal Lamy has put forward a compromise text on eliminating agricultural export subsidies in a last-minute bid to overcome a stalemate at trade talks here.

The text, presented to WTO ministers late Friday and seen by AFP, seeks to assure the European Union that whatever concessions it makes on farm trade will be matched by parallel moves from the United States and other developed countries.

The EU has come under intense pressure from all sides at World Trade Organization talks here to offer deeper cuts in trade-distorting farm subsidies and import tariffs but has steadfastly refused to change its position.

The deadlock threatens the outcome of the conference, called to spur movement toward a global trade liberalization accord and which ends Sunday.

The text calls for "detailed modalities that ensure the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect."

As to a date by which such government support will be scrapped, the document mentions within brackets both the year 2010 and "by x years after implementation" of the overall accord.

That agreement, which would emerge from the current Doha Round of negotiations, would probably not take effect until 2008 under the best of circumstances, trade analysts said.

The European Union has refused to agree to a date by which export subsidies would be abolished on grounds that the United States has not made an equivalent commitment on its export credits and food aid program, which the EU sees as trade distorting.

The EU is also pressing Australia, New Zealand and Canada to reform their state trading monopolies.

On the issue of market access, the proposal says WTO members would adopt "four bands for structuring tariff cuts." Such a system would give greater flexibility to governments to tailor tariff cuts to specific products.

It says in essence that governments wishing to maintain high tariffs on "sensitive products," those that are of special economic importance, would be obliged to offer exporters a comparably higher access quota.
