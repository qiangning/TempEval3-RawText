LaDainian Tomlinson seized the National Football League single-season record for touchdowns on Sunday as the San Diego Chargers captured the AFC West division crown.

Tomlinson rushed for three touchdowns to take his total for the season to 29, eclipsing the record of 28 set by Seattle's Shaun Alexander last year.

The Chargers downed the Denver Broncos 48-20 to win the division for the second time in three years, improving to 11-2. That's the best record in the AFC, one game ahead of Indianapolis for home field advantage throughout the playoffs.

The Colts lost for the second week in a row, wasting another chance to clinch the AFC South title as they fell 44-17 to Jacksonville.

Rookie Maurice Jones-Drew rushed for a season-high 166 yards and two touchdowns and scored on a 93-yard kickoff return for the Jaguars, who rushed for a franchise record 375 yards against their division rivals.

"Not much to say except they dominated us from start to finish," said Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, who completed 25-of-50 passes. "We just need a win to get back on track."

The New England Patriots also failed in their bid to clinch the AFC East, suffering their first shut-out since 2003 at the hands of Miami.

Jason Taylor and Yeremiah Bell led a defensive assault on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, while Joey Harrington and Sammy Morris managed the Dolphins' offense to a 21-0 victory in a battle of division rivals.

Brady, a two-time Super Bowl MVP, endured a nightmare game, completing 12-of-25 passes for only 78 yards. He was sacked five times and lost one of his two fumbles.

In contrast, the Chargers continued a dream run on Sunday with their seventh win in a row.

"It is extra meaningful, because not only do you break the record, but you clinch the division and clinch a playoff spot and then you take over the No. 1 seed in the AFC," said Tomlinson, who has 26 touchdowns rushing and three receiving.

"So many things happened today that are special for this football team."

Tomlinson broke Alexander's record in dramatic style, rushing for two of his scores in a 47-second span late in the fourth quarter.

Tomlinson had pulled within one of the record when he scored on a seven-yard run with 23 seconds left in the second quarter to help the Chargers build a 28-3 lead.

Tomlinson, who finished with 103 yards on 28 carries, scored on a six-yard run to tie Alexander's record with 3:57 left in the fourth quarter.

It appeared Tomlinson would have to wait another week to break the mark. But on Denver's ensuing possession, linebacker Shawne Merriman stripped the ball from rookie quarterback Jay Cutler and the Chargers recovered at the Denver 7 yard line.

Tomlinson then took a handoff from Philip Rivers and raced around the left side for a seven-yard touchdown.

The loss was the fourth in a row for the Broncos, who slipped one game behind Jacksonville and Cincinnati in the AFC wild-card race.

The Bengals stayed in the postseason mix with a 27-10 victory over lowly Oakland.

Baltimore moved a step closer to the AFC North title with a 20-10 victory over Kansas City.

NFC East leaders Dallas were thrashed 42-17 by NFC South leaders New Orleans.

Saints quarterback Drew Brees dismantled the Cowboys, matching a career high with five touchdowns and completing 26-of-38 passes for 384 yards. His huge night gave him a league-high 4,033 passing yards for the season.

The Saints improved to 9-4 and have a two-game lead in the NFC South over Atlanta, who beat the lackluster Tampa Bay Buccaneers 17-6.

Elsewhere in the NFC East, both the New York Giants and Philadelphia improved to 7-6, the Giants with a 27-13 victory over Carolina and Philadelphia with a 21-19 victory over Washington.

For the Eagles the game was the first of a tough three-game road trip against division rivals.

In other games, Arizona surprised Seattle 27-21, Buffalo beat the New York Jets 31-13, Minnesota downed Detroit 30-20, Tennessee topped Houston 26-20 in overtime, and Green Bay beat San Francisco 30-19.
