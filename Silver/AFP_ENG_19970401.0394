Heaven's Gate Internet sites will exist in cyberspace for months because, shortly before committing mass suicide, cult members paid access providers to maintain them.

The sites, updated just one week before Heaven's Gate's 39 members killed themselves in a mansion outside San Diego, California, outlines the group's belief that aliens aboard a spaceship would give them new life.

Ed Deppe, head of access provider Spacestar Communications, said his company received several telephone calls from the group shortly before the suicides seeking to make sure that Spacestar had gotten the maintenance payments.

To make absolutely sure, Heaven's Gate had made two payments to Spacestar dated March 21. When Spacestar asked how it should reimburse the group for its overpayment, a member of the cult reportedly said that it was impossible.

"You can't contact us anymore in California. We're going to be moving," Deppe recalled a cult member telling him.

The site was briefly shut down on Thursday -- the day after police discovered the bodies -- after some 900,000 callers jammed the Internet, Deppe said.

The Heaven's Gate site is now open again and will remain accessible for four months, Deppe said. The cost of maintaining a site ranges from 50 to 100 dollars per month.

The cult created an identical site with another access provider in an apparent bid to guarantee that it would leave behind a cyberspace presence.

Meanwhile, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was analyzing the contents of computers at the cult's compound in Rancho Santa Fe. That analysis could take up to six weeks.

Among the other items the cult left behind is a 223-page script about itself that could become a movie soon.

"It's a script that needs a lot of massaging because it's very raw material. But it's a Hollywood natural at this point if there ever was one," Alex Papas, a producer with rights to the script, told The New York Times.

Several members of the cult who rented an Arizona house from Papas in 1995 wrote the script in hopes that Papas could help them tell their story and expand their membership.

Titled "Beyond Human," the script "threw in a lot about UFOs and space aliens and earthlings evolving from their 'containers' to a 'higher level,'" Papas said.

Suicide is not mentioned in the script, he added.
