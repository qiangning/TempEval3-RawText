The luxury car showrooms are shuttered, the shoppers have been replaced by phalanxes of police and many offices have been temporarily relocated.

Central Hong Kong, some of the most expensive real estate in the world, has been spooked by fear of anti-globalisation violence.

The conspicuous displays of wealth characteristic of a city that revels in its status as one of Asia's consumer capitals were hidden behind metal shutters and wooden hoardings as the World Trade Organisation meeting began.

After violent protests at previous WTO meetings in the United States and Mexico, companies and retailers operating in the Wan Chai district surrounding the meeting venue were taking no chances.

Many workers were advised to operate from home and some companies, such as telecoms firm Reach, temporarily relocated operations to outlying districts, leaving only a skeleton staff for the duration of the six-day meeting.

Instead of office workers crowding the sidewalks of Wan Chai's Gloucester Road, groups of police stood ready in case protests turned violent, part of a massive security operation involving 9,000 officers staged for the WTO meeting.

"Everyone is tense, lots of people stay away," waitress Maya Thapa told AFP at a Wan Chai cafe.

"We had no customers at all yesterday, normally we would be crowded now," she added, gesturing around the empty eatery.

Nearby, luxury car showrooms stood empty, their vehicles garaged in case prestige brands such as Lamborghini and Maserati acted as magnets for demonstrators.

"Sorry for any inconvenience caused," said a note plastered on metal cyclone shutters protecting the Alfa Romeo dealership.

Jewellers and art galleries removed their eye-catching displays, while some banks closed cash dispensing machines along the route of Tuesday's planned protest march.

The management company of one city office block, which houses a major international finance firm, even gave workers in the building supplies of noodles in case protests left them stranded in the workplace for long periods.

Items of street furniture were removed to prevent demonstrators using them as missiles, while the closure of an entire city district discouraged motorists, reducing traffic to a trickle.

Huge golden Christmas decorations remained on display outside the Dah Sing Financial Centre, watched by a large contingent of security guards.

"No one's worried about the locals -- Hong Kong people are very peaceful and have shown they can protest in a non-violent way," expatriate British bar owner Ken Cheshire told AFP.

"We're worried about the people who've been flown in, we know they've caused trouble before."

Cheshire said custom at his bar, The Junk Pub, was down by 50 percent.

"Part of that's seasonal, expats going home for Christmas, but there's definitely been an atmosphere created by the WTO and people are staying away," he said. "You just have to look at the amount of businesses around here that are not opening."

All along the march route, including a section that runs through Causeway Bay, one of the world's busiest shopping areas, stores were shuttered.

Japanese department store Sogo, locked its doors and rolled down its shutters as marchers gathered in the nearby Victoria Park.

And guests at neighbouring hotels suddenly found their digs swathed in yards of green mesh, as hoteliers sought to protect their businesses.
