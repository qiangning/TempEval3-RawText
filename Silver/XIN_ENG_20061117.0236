U.S. House Republicans elected Representative John Boehner of Ohio as the minority leader for the new Congress that convenes in early January 2007.

Boehner, who succeeded Tom DeLay of Texas as the House majority leader in February, defeated Representative Mike Pence of Indiana in a vote of 168-27. Texas Representative Joe Barton got only one vote.

Boehner, currently the majority leader, would become the top Republican in the House, after the Republican Party lost control of the House in last week's elections and would become the minority leader in the 110th Congress.

Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert currently holds the top party post in the House, but he indicated he would not seek the top post after the party's defeat in the elections.

Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, currently the House majority whip, was competing with John Shadegg of Arizona for the No. 2 party post in House as minority whip.

Democrats elected their House leadership on Thursday. Nancy Pelosi of California was selected as the speaker-elect, the first woman to become U.S. House speaker, and Steny Hoyer of Maryland was chosen as the majority leader-elect.

Democrats won control of both the House and the Senate in the Nov. 7 legislative elections, the first time in a dozen years.
