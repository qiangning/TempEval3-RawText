US President George W. Bush spoke Wednesday of his heartbreak and pain at the deaths of US soldiers in Iraq, but said the best way to honor their sacrifice was to ensure it was not in vain.

"(The) most painful aspect of my presidency has been knowing that good men and women have died in combat," Bush said during a year-end news conference.

"I read about it every night. I -- my heart breaks for a mother or father or husband and wife or son and daughter," he said gravely.

"I reach out to a lot of the families. I spend time with them. I am always inspired by their spirit.

"Most people have asked me to do one thing, and that is to make sure that their child didn't die in vain. And I agree with that -- that the sacrifice has been worth it. We'll accomplish our objective."

"You know, my heart breaks for them. It just does -- on a regular basis."

His remarks came after a reporter asked whether he lay awake at night second guessing his decisions, as former US president Lyndon Johnson reputedly did, during the Vietnam War.

The US death toll in Iraq has now reached 2,947, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures. In December alone, at least 64 soldiers have been killed.

Bush has been harshly criticized in some quarters for not attending funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq, but frequently holds private meetings with families of the fallen.

The president also said he was also at peace with the decision to invade Iraq in 2003.

"I haven't questioned whether or not it was right to take Saddam Hussein out. I mean, I've questioned it -- I've come to the conclusion that it was the right decision.

"It's the right decision for America to stay engaged, and to take the lead, and to deal with these radicals and extremists, and to help support young democracies.

"It's the calling of our time, and I firmly believe it is necessary."
