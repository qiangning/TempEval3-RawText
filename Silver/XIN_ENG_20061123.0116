Polish President Lech Kaczynski announced three days of national mourning for the victims in a mine blast in southern Poland, the official PAP news agency reported on Thursday.

The mourning period, starting on Thursday, came after all 23 miners trapped in the Halemba coal mine in the southern Polish city of Ruda Slaskain were confirmed dead, the report said.

The accident occurred on Tuesday night when a methane gas explosion 1,030 meters underground shook the Halemba coal mine. There were 31 miners working in the area at that time, and eight of them managed to escape.

The mine accident is the country's deadliest so far this year, bringing the number of miners killed in 2006 in Poland to 43.
