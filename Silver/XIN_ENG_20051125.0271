China experienced little change in its average precipitation over the past three decades, according to an analytical report released recently by Chinese scientists.

Experts with the Research Institute of Cold and Arid Regions Environment and Engineering under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) analyzed observatory data from 385 meteorological stations nationwide.

According to the report, the nation's average precipitation reached its minimum in the 1970s and has since remained basically unchanged.

However, the development trend of precipitation varied in different regions.

Precipitation in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Qilian Mountain, northeast China, the southeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and east China tended to increase noticeably.

Meanwhile, precipitation in the central part of northwest China, the southwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and most stretches of central and north China tended to decrease obviously.

Zuo Hongchao, who took part in the precipitation investigation, said the research was of great importance, as changes in precipitation would impact water resources, agricultural production and the ecological system in China.
