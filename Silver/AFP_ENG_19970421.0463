Former film star Brigitte Bardot on Monday attacked city fathers in Moscow over what she called the "massacre" of stray animals in the Russian capital ahead of celebrations for its 850th birthday.

In an open letter to Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov she said she was "shocked and horrified" at the killings of animals in a clean-up of the streets ahead of the celebrations in September.

"The millions spent in particular on poison for animals .. could be used to help less well off people who make sacrifices every day," said the former screen idol turned animal rights activist.

She called on the Moscow mayor to launch a program of sterilization for animals instead of killing them "to make your city's name shine when it celebrates in (the anniversary) September."
