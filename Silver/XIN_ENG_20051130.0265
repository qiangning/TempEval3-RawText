The members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) expect to cooperate with NATO in tackling common threats and challenges, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said Wednesday.

The CSTO has long been interested in cooperation with NATO in countering modern threats that both organizations face, such as drug trafficking, Ivanov was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying at a meeting of the group's defense ministers' meeting in Moscow.

"We shall get nowhere by definition unless we take joint measures," Ivanov said.

The CSTO links Russia with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would discuss cooperation with the Western alliance on behalf of the CSTO at a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council next week, Ivanov said.
