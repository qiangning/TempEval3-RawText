Amid tight security, Chechens voted on Sunday to elect a parliament that officials say will enable the war-ravaged region to function as a normal part of the Russian state after years of conflict.

The fourth vote in the region since 2003, which came after two presidential elections and one constitutional referendum, this parliamentary poll will give Chechnya a full set of government bodies.

A total of 600,000 voters were registered in Chechnya for the polls, which will elect 58 deputies to the two-chamber parliament - - the Republican Council (upper house) and the People's Assembly ( lower house). The election has drawn 342 candidates from eight parties.

Polling stations opened at 8:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) amid heightened security in this volatile region, where separatist rebels have frequently targeted security forces as well as civilians in bombing attacks for much of the past decade, Russian news agencies reported.

The Interior Ministry deployed 24,000 police and troops to provide security and metal detectors were set up at polling stations to guard against weapons and explosives, the Itar-Tass news agency said.

Chechen President Alu Alkhanov pronounced the poll valid about four hours into voting, citing reports of voter turnout reaching the threshold for validity.

"Based on reports we have received from the heads of districts and territorial election commissions, I can officially announce that the Chechen parliamentary elections are valid," Alkhanov said.

The polls closed at 6:00 p.m. (1500 GMT) and Chechen Elections Commission Chairman Ismail Baikhanov put the turnout at 57 percent.

Preliminary results will be announced by Monday noon but official results will only be available by the end of next week, Baikhanov said.

President Vladimir Putin has called the election a "milestone" that will boost stability in the republic and the whole North Caucasus region.

About 20 observers from international groups including the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States visited polling stations to monitor the vote.

Alkhanov met with international observers for the election Sunday, saying the election will "confirm Chechnya's path of construction, peace and cooperation with those who share these guidelines."

"Democratic processes in the republic will become more dynamic, as we will have the power body crowning the republican statehood," Alkhanov said.

Alkhanov wanted the new parliament to convene as soon as possible to adopt laws. "We plan to hold the first meeting between Dec. 10-15," he said.

Many in the war-ravaged region expected the new parliament to focus on ending the violence.

"We have a goal of termination of the warfare. Our mission will be complete when shooting ceases and abductions stop," Chechnya's First Deputy Prime Minister Ramzan said.
