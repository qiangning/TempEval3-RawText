Pulitzer Prize-winning jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, responding to George magazine's "If I were president" questionnaire, says he would bring a sense of rhythm to the White House.

"The people would never see me clapping on one and three," he says when asked to name a reason to elect him.

His first official act would be to make Mardi Gras "a national celebration."

"I'd also have a big computer called the Match Maker, with everybody's name in it. You could call it up and find your perfect match," he said.

His running mate would be TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and his closest adviser would be Danny Sheridan, the oddsmaker.
