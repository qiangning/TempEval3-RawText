The US dollar rose to the lower 119 yen level Friday in Tokyo as the yen faced selling after Japan's tame inflation data dimmed prospects that the Bank of Japan would abandon its ultra-loose monetary policy in the near future.

At 5 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 119.26-28 yen, up from Thursday's quotes of 118.75-85 yen at 4 p.m. in London and 118.76- 79 yen at 5 p.m. in Tokyo. US financial markets were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.

The dollar moved between 118.90 yen and 119.32 yen during the day, trading most frequently at 119.27 yen.

The euro was quoted at 1.1752-1754 dollars and 140.16-20 yen against 1.1780-1790 dollars and 140.05-10 yen at 4 p.m. Thursday in London and 1.1812-1815 dollars and 140.31-35 yen at 5 p.m. Thursday in Tokyo.
