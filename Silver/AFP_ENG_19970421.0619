In what was widely interpreted as intervention in the British election campaign, a speech by European Commission President Jacques Santer attacking Euro-scepticism was roundly condemned here Tuesday.

The Conservatives leapt on Santer's speech, delivered in English in Amsterdam to the Dutch Association of European Journalists, in which he called Euro-sceptics "prophets of doom".

Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind said he "passionately welcomed" the speech as highlighting Conservative reservations about European intergration.

One Conservative party source said Santer's speech was "manna from Heaven" allowing the Conservatives to highlight their own Euro- scepticism and attack opposition party Labour, which they claim would surrender Britain's interests to Europe after the May 1 poll.

"If it is right for Britain, I will keep my feet on the brakes," said Tory Prime Minister John Major. "(Labour leader Tony) Blair would go to the (Intergovernmental Conference in) Amsterdam and put his foot on the accelerator to a federal Europe."

Labour called Santer's speech "ill-judged and unwise", and attempted to promote their own Euro-scepticism by noting that Santer's appointment had been approved by Major in 1994.

"Santer should be in no doubt that a Labour government will make decisions based on British needs in the British interests under the strong leadership of Tony Blair," said Labour's economics spokesman Gordon Brown.

In his speech, Santer said: "We have only one option: to move on. But it will not silence the prophets of doom."

Although he did not directly refer to Britain, his speech was interpreted as a direct attack on British Euro-scepticism. Press reports here said Santer had dropped a reference to a Conservative campaign advertisment in which Blair was depicted as a puppet sitting on German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's knees.

Meanwhile centrist Liberal Democrats leader Paddy Ashdown was the only party leader to endorse further European integration, saying he was in favour of a federal Europe.

And Labour, in its latest attack on the Tories, depicted Major and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke as film stars Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy to illustrate an Organisation of Economic and Development report on per capita income which said Britain had sunk to 21st in the world.

"Another fine mess" read the caption, echoing Hardy's catchphrase.
