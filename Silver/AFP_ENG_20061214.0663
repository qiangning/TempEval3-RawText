Brazil and Russia agreed Thursday to develop cooperation in military, trade, space and energy affairs during a visit by Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, officials said.

Reporters peppered Lavrov and his Brazilian counterpart, Celso Amorim, with questions about a proposed purchase of Russian-made military helicopters at a joint news conference.

Amorim would only say there had been a discussion of whether the helicopters would be bought already assembled or be assembled in Brazil, and whether they would have Brazilian components.

The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported last week that the deal involves 30 Russian military attack and transport helicopters, worth 400 million dollars and sought by the Brazilian government to fight smuggling and drug trafficking.

Russia recently sold arms and aircraft to Venezuela, but Lavrov denied that his country was pursuing a career as a weapons supplier in Latin America.

"We are not selling them to any country that violates international laws," Lavrov said.

The top diplomats of the two resource-rich countries also discussed biofuels, an area of expertise for Brazil, and signed an agreement to protect technology in their planned cooperation in space projects.
