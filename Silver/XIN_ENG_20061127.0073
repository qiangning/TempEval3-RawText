An Iranian military aircraft Antonov- 74 crashed at Tehran's airport early Monday, killing 36 people including 30 members of the Revolutionary Guards, state television

reported.

Some 30 Revolutionary Guards members and six crews on board were killed, and another two had survived and were immediately hospitalized, a statement by the force was quoted as saying and corrected previous casualty number.

Earlier, the television had said the number of victims was 38.

However, Gen. Eskandar Moemeni, a deputy police chief, told reporters that the death toll had increased to 39 after three wounded people died in the hospital.

Due to the chaos of statistic among different units, it's not immediately clear which number was correct.

The Antonov-74 plane, belonging to the Revolutionary Guards, crashed shortly after taking off from Mehrabad airport, said the television.

The plane was heading toward Shiraz in the south of Iran when the disaster took place, it said.

According to a detailed report from local Fars news agency, Reza Jafarzadeh, the spokesman for the Iranian civil aviation organization, said the plane "crash at the end of runway at 7:30 local time (0400 GMT)."

From the latest report of the official IRNA news agency, a Revolutionary Guards source said the plane caught fire in one of its engines immediately after leaving the runway.

The television report said some high-ranking officers of the Revolutionary Guards were among the dead, but the IRNA, citing the

Revolutionary Guards source, said the plane carried no military commander.

For the recent years, Iran has witnessed a high rate of air crashes due to lack of spare parts and inadequate maintenance of aircraft.

An Iranian C-130 aircraft, bound for the Gulf seaport city of Bandar Abbas, crashed on Dec. 6, 2005, in a residential area and hit a 10-story apartment block, killing 108 people.

On Jan. 9, a small Falcon jet of the Revolutionary Guards crashed in Iran's northwestern border province of West Azarbaijan.
