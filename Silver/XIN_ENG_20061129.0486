Jordanian King Abdullah II on Wednesday held talks with visiting U.S. President George W. Bush at Raghadan Palace Wednesday night to discuss regional conflicts and the situation in Iraq.

During the talks, the king explained Jordan's position, "namely underlining the need to make real progress on the Palestinian issue because regional complications and challenges are due to the Palestinian problem," Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib said.

A just solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will help stem violence in the region, and Palestinian-Israeli peace could be a catalyst for achieving a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis, Khatib quoted the king as saying.

During the talks, the king urged Bush to work on moving the peace process forward by bringing together Palestinian and Israeli points of views in a bid to resume negotiations as soon as possible.

The establishment of a viable, independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil living alongside a secure Israel is the only logical and internationally acceptable solution to the conflict, the king said.

He urged the international community and the U.S. administration to help alleviate the Palestinians' suffering and ease economic pressure on the Palestinians to enable Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to maintain national unity and reinforce security.

For his part, Bush said that the United States was committed to a two-state solution to the conflict, adding that it is necessary to create appropriate circumstances to move the peace process forward.

The two leaders also discussed sectarian violence in Iraq, Khatib said.

"The Iraqi matter was also a central issue during the discussions and the talks focused on the importance of working to rebuild stability in Iraq," he said.

The two leaders agreed that the Lebanese should be allowed to resolve political tension in their country without outside influence. They also discussed Iran's nuclear standoff.
