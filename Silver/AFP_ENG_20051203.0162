Slovak Dominik Hrbaty has replaced Karol Beck in doubles for Saturday's rubber against Croatia at the Davis Cup final.

Officials announced the expected change, which will send Hrbaty into the match alongside teammate Michael Mertinak. Croatia will field Mario Ancic and Ivan Ljubicic in a tie which stands level at 1-1.

Beck had also been replaced by veteran Karol Kucera in Friday's opening singles tie.

He had been suffering with a left knee injury during the closing stages of the ATP season, and is also the subject of unconfirmed reports of a positive test for a banned substance at his country's Davis Cup quarter-final victory over Argentina in September.

Ljubicic stormed past Kucera 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 to put the visitors into early command Friday before Hrbaty levelled for the hosts with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 victory over Ancic.
