RAFAH, Gaza Strip, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- It is the first time in the history of the Palestinian cause that the Palestinians enjoy freedom, as an agreement to re-operate Rafah Crossing on the borders between Gaza and Egypt was officially implemented on Friday.

President Mahmoud Abbas, who arrived at the crossing on Friday afternoon for the inauguration ceremony, said that opening of the crossing is a key to achieve peace, security and economic development in the region.

It is the first time ever that the Palestinians control the border crossing of Rafah, which was under the Israeli army control for dozens of years. Israel withdrew from the crossing and the entire Gaza Strip on Sept. 12.

An agreement had been reached between Israel, Egypt and the Palestinians two weeks ago with the mediation of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who had visited the region and pushed hard on the two sides to hammer out the agreement.

According to the agreement, the Palestinians would be fully responsible for their part of the crossing and the Egyptians would control their side, while EU observers will be present at the crossing.

The EU observers will watch the Palestinian passengers' movement at the crossing, where Gaza Strip residents, who are officially registered as citizens in Gaza, will be allowed only to travel through the crossing.

Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a Palestinian official spokesman told reporters that after inauguration ceremony was held on Friday afternoon, the Rafah Crossing will officially start working on Saturday morning.

"Palestinians can cross through Rafah Crossing from Saturday and it would be opened for four hours in the first ten days as a test and then it will be opened for 24 hours a day,"said Abu Rudeineh.

70 EU observers will observe the crossing during the first ten days, the number of the observers will be minimized to 50 when the crossing is fully opened.

"The first and last decisive word will be in the Palestinians hands. The European presence will never be an alternative to the Palestinian presence, and the Europeans will never be representing the Israeli side at the crossing," added Abu Rudeineh.

EU Middle East envoy Marc Otte and some Arab and foreign representatives participated in the ceremony at the Rafah terminal.

"We are here to help you but not to replace you, it is the Palestinian (National) Authority to be in charge of the border," Otte told Abbas and scores of other high-ranking Palestinian officials.

Otte said that "we want to leave as soon as we can, because when we go it means we have succeeded. Our success is your success. "

Egypt's chief of intelligence Omer Suleiman and other high- ranking Egyptian security officers were also present at the ceremony.

Mahmoud Al-Zahar, leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas), who took part in the ceremony, was seen shaking hands with Palestinian Minister of Civil Affairs Mohamed Dahlan.

Replied the questions by reporters that if his presence at the crossing meant his movement accepted the Rafah agreement to re- operate the crossing, al-Zahar said "our presence here is symbolic and doesn't mean that we accept the whole agreement."

"We are here to say that we only accept the positive parts of the agreement, but if the crossing would be isolated the Palestinians from the Arab world, we will of course fight against the Israeli occupation," said al-Zahar.

The Islamic Jihad (Holy War) said in a leaflet that it boycotts the ceremony, because the agreement is still incomplete and vague.

At the same time, Jihad criticized stationing cameras that reporting to Israelis about the movement of the Palestinians at the crossing.

Dahlan, as the PNA Minister of Civil Affairs said Friday that operating Rafah crossing on the borders between Gaza and Egypt is the first step towards establishing the dependent Palestinian state.

"We open the crossing is to re-creat life for the Palestinian people towards freedom and independence and the establishment of an independent state that borders Egypt,"said Dahlan, adding the step was supported by Jordan, Egypt and the European Union.

Having a crossing and a free access for the Palestinian people is their right and an important step to achieve peace in the Middle East, Dahlan stressed.
