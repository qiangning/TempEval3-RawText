India's Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral expressed grief here Wednesday after an inferno near Mecca killed 217 Moslem pilgrims, including an estimated 100 Indians.

Gujral told AFP: "It's a tragedy, it's very. very sad. So many lives have been lost.

"These were humans. It's not just Indians. There were people from Pakistan and Bangladesh. I share their grief."

A spokesman from the Indian foreign ministry here said earlier: "We have no means of knowing accurately how many Indians have died.

"We fear the number will be slightly below 100. That is what we suspect."

The Saudi authorities Wednesday increased the overall toll from the blaze in Mina, near Mecca, to 217. Another 1,290 people were injured, many seriously.

The inferno was sparked by a gas cooking bottle. Thousands of tents in camps housing pilgrims from Pakistan, India, Jordan and Palestine were burnt down.

Gujral said around 60 Indian doctors working in the region had been alerted while India's junior home minister, Maqbool Dhar, was already on the spot to supervise assistance.

"We have set up a control office here and in Jeddah to co-ordinate the operation -- I hope we can provide some help."

The foreign ministry spokesman, however, added: "We will have to wait for the pilgrims to return to Mecca from Arafat to know exactly how many are missing ... it is not an easy job."

Earlier, the Press Trust of India (PTI), quoting India's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, estimated the Indian dead at around 100. He said another 37 Indians had been hospitalised.

Ambassador M.H. Ansari said: "We are in a crisis situation."

Around 4,000 Indian pilgrims were housed in a camp near the site of the tragedy. The foreign ministry spokesman said there had been 80,000 Indians among the two million pilgrims.

A prominent Indian Moslem cleric, meanwhile, said it was "highly regrettable" that there had not been better safety measures and called for a ban of cooking inside Hajj pilgrim camps.

"When a fire starts in the tents housing the pilgrims, it tends to spread very fast because of strong winds," said Mohammed Mouzzam Ahmed of the Fatehpuri mosque, one of India's biggest Islamic shrines.

"While the Saudi authorities make excellent arrangements, their fire- fighting measures are somewhat lacking. This is highly regrettable.

"There should be a centralised cooking system, and that place should be heavily protected against fires."

India's population of 950 million is made up of a majority of Hindus, but includes around 120 million Moslems.
