The share of foreign debt in South Korean companies' total liabilities soared to a 16-year high of 10.2 percent last year, reflecting a credit squeeze here, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said Friday.

The overseas debt totalled 12.1 trillion won (13.6 billion dollars) in 1996, compared with 8.4 trillion won in 1995 when the ratio stood at 8.4 percent of the total.

Slowing exports and a slump in domestic sales that aggravated credit conditions were blamed for the increase in the foreign debt ratio, a bank official said.

The central bank said in a statement the companies' total liabilities rose 18.2 percent from a year before to 118.2 trillion won last year, following a 12.3 percent expansion in 1995.

South Korean firms took out 37 trillion won, or 31.3 percent of the total liabilities, from local financial institutions in 1996, while raising funds totalling 55.6 trillion won through issuing corporate bonds and stocks, the bank said.

Earlier this week, the finance and economy ministry said it would ease regulations governing the inflow of foreign funds and its heavily protected bond market to stabilize the ailing capital market here.
