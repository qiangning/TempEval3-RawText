British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said on Thursday that British troops would continue to stay in Iraq as long as they are required.

Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank in London, Beckett said "the situation in Iraq is one which is dangerous and volatile."

"We are at a critical juncture which the fate of that country hangs in the balance. There is the very real risk of even greater instability and bloodshed than we have already seen," she said.

British troops would "stay as long as that government asks us to do so." she said, adding that "we will leave when they are confident that they can take the role of security in the country on their own shoulders."

Beckett warned against any "precipitate" moves to withdraw British troops from Iraq.

"I ask those who are calling for more precipitate action to consider the consequences of such action," she said.

"We would be leaving the Iraqi government without the means to prevent a further escalation in the violence, without the tools to enforce the rule of law and without the authority to prevent their country from turning into a base for terrorism," she said. "We must not let that happen."

Currently, Britain has some 7,200 troops deployed in southern Iraq, most in the southern Basra area and about 800 in Maysan province. Since 2003, the number of British troops killed in Iraq has increased to 121.
