Tanzania's National Electoral Commission has removed more than 10,000 people from the country's permanent voters register.

These people therefore will not be eligible for the country's general elections slated for December 14 this year.

Sisti Cariah, IT manager of the electoral body, told local media that some of these people were either under-age or not bona fide citizens while others had either passed away or were in prison.

The National Electoral Commission removed these people after a general review and the electoral body promised to accept some 4, 000 of-age voters who were not eligible for the general elections originally scheduled for October 30.

This year's general elections, the third multi-party polls in the country since 1995, will be held on December 14 which is already rendered a public holiday through a special presidential decree to facilitate voting.

The general elections had to be postponed in the wake of the death of a presidential running mate from the Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA) party on October 26.

The CHADEMA presidential running mate, Jumbe Rajab Jumbe, died of heart attack on October 26.
