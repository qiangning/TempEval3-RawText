North Korea may stage a second nuclear weapons test to strengthen its hand during upcoming negotiations on scrapping its nuclear programme, South Korea's new defence minister warned Friday.

Kim Jang-Soo, a former army chief of staff, ordered the 650,000-strong military to step up combat-readiness to deter possible aggression from the North, the defence ministry said.

"We have to be thoroughly prepared to counter the possibility of a second or third nuclear test by North Korea and a possible hostile act by it in the process of negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme," Kim said in a message to troops.

The six-nation nuclear talks are set to resume in Beijing on Monday, 13 months after the North walked out. They involve the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia.

The North staged its first nuclear test on October 9, sparking international condemnation and United Nations sanctions.

Later that month North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il told China that he had no plans for a second test but that increased international pressure could trigger "further measures".

Defence minister Kim issued his letter after a closed-door meeting of 130 senior commanders, including General Kim Kwan-Jin, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the army, navy and air force chiefs of staff.

The defence minister also urged no further delay in the planned relocation of US bases to Pyeongtaek south of Seoul.

The defence ministry said this week that South Korea would not be able to complete a major relocation of US military bases by 2008 as scheduled, due to protests by residents and a dispute over cost-sharing.

The US forces want to consolidate 35 US bases scattered across the nation into two hub bases by 2008, including one at Pyeongtaek.

Some 29,500 troops are stationed in the country, a legacy of the Korean War. The number is set to drop to 25,000 by 2008.
