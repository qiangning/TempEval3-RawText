The Japanese cabinet on Thursday approved measures to force Okinawa landowners to renew US base leases as a new sex attack blamed on a US Navy officer threatened to cause a fresh controversy over the US military presence in Japan.

The cabinet approved a bill to revise a special law so US military forces can continue using land on the southern island of Okinawa despite the angry refusal of landowners to renew leases.

The bill was sent to parliament with debate expected to start Friday, parliament officials said. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto hoped to enact the bill on April 18 before he leaves for the United States on April 24 for key talks, Jiji press said.

Hashimoto said he would not ask US President Bill Clinton to reduce the number of troops in Japan at their summit on April 25.

"It is not a time for discussing a reduction in US troops," he told a parliament committee.

Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota issued a statement saying the cabinet decision was "very regrettable," while a landlords' group denounced the government move as "an outrageous, fascist act."

A new controversy over the US military presence was expected after a US Navy petty officer was taken into custody by US military authorities Wednesday accused of sexually assaulting a Japanese woman.

Anti-US sentiment was heightened in Okinawa after the rape of a local schoolgirl by three US servicemen in September 1995.

The latest assault allegedly took place at a navy enlisted quarters in Yokosuka, near Tokyo. It also came just ahead of a visit to Japan by US Defense Secretary William Cohen.

Japanese police are leading the investigation. After the 1995 rape, an accord on US personnel in Japan was revised to enable Japanese authorities to question accused US military even before they are formally charged.

The law change would allow the US military to continue running 12 Okinawa facilities on land owned by some 3,000 people who have refused to renew leases which expire on May 14.

The bill stipulates the government can continue using land for the US military by providing compensation to landlords, even if it fails to gain approval for new leases.

Around 27,000 of the 47,000 US troops in Japan are in Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japan's land area, but accommodates three-quarters of US military facilities in the country.

The move to revise the 1952 land expropriation law has been strongly opposed by Okinawans and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which has generally allied itself to Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in parliament.

But calls to reduce the number of troops in the island have been rejected by the United States because of tensions on the Korean peninsula.

The base issue has also shaken the ruling alliance in which the LDP has teamed up with the SDP and centrist New party Sakigake against the main opposition New Frontier Party (NFP).

The SDP is under growing pressure over the bases. The Sankei Shimbun quoted a senior LDP official as saying the socialists were "too selfish" in seeking a continued alliance with the LDP while opposing the law revision.

SDP chairman Takako Doi voiced opposition to the revision bill.

"The bill is far from a minimum measure ... It would enpower the government to do whatever it wants, and I am opposed to it," Jiji quoted Doi as telling reporters.

NFP leader Ichiro Ozawa is reportedly ready to cooperate with Hashimoto.

The two failed to reach an accord on the law revision at meeting which went into the early hours of Thursday, but Hashimoto told reporters after that the two had "a common view in many points."

An NFP official said Ozawa was to meet Hashimoto again on Thursday or later.

The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Ozawa's contact with Hashimoto had made a future conservative alliance between his party and the LDP look "more realistic."

The LDP and NFP have a combined 385 votes in the 500-seat lower house.
