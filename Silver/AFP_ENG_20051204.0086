UBS Hong Kong Open champion Colin Montgomerie did his best to console a tearful James Kingston on Sunday after the South African threw away a one-shot lead on the last hole.

"I must say that everyone's heart goes out to James Kingston there," said the eight-time European Order of Merit winner, who carded rounds of of 69, 66, 66 and 70 to win by a shot after Kingston's double-bogey on 18.

"That should have been a play-off at worst to be honest and then we would have had more drama coming down that last hole.

"We all feel for him. Every golfer who plays the game feels for someone who doubles the last to lose. It has happened before and unfortunately it will happen again but on this occasion I am glad that I managed to take the spoils after that."

'Monty' birdied four, 10 and 14 but bogeyed 11 to be one shot back from Kingston, who was 10 under par and leading by a shot until the final hole.

It was Kingston's second meltdown in as many years on the same hole after he bogeyed the last in 2004 to finish joint second behind Miguel Angel Jimenez.

"It's amazing, five minutes afterwards he put his arm around me and said well done. He must have been nervous on the last hole -- it's a very difficult hole, a very difficult drive and I think that's what hurt him," said Montgomerie.

Montgomerie said he thought Kingston already had it won -- but he was delighted to have avoided a play-off.

"He bogeyed 16 but had par on 17 so I was expecting to lose. I was expecting to congratulate the winner when he came in," said the Scot, 42.

"My play-off record is terrible so I was glad we didn't have one. I've been in nine play-offs and I think I've only won one -- against Ernie Els in Sun City, so I hardly got out alive!"
