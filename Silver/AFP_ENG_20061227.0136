Two Muslims and a Buddhist were shot dead and an elementary school was burned by suspected Islamic militants in Thailand's insurgency-torn south on Wednesday, police said.

A 47-year-old Muslim security volunteer was killed by four militants at a tea shop in Pattani, one of three Muslim-majority southern provinces bordering Malaysia.

Also in Pattani, several insurgents set fire to a government-run elementary school, gutting its main building, police said. No one was injured in the arson attack.

Later Wednesday in nearby Yala province, a 47-year-old Buddhist man was shot dead by two suspected militants, and a 52-year-old Muslim farmer was killed by gunfire as he travelled through Yala on his motorbike.

The restive area was an independent sultanate until it was annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand in 1902. Separatist violence has erupted periodically ever since.

The latest violence has killed more than 1,700 people since January 2004.

Thailand's military-installed government, which came to power following a bloodless coup in September that ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra, has offered a number of olive branches in a bid to forge peace in the troubled south.

But deadly attacks have continued to rock the three provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat.
