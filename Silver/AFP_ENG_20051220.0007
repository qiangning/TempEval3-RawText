Japan's NTT DoCoMo said Wednesday it was in talks with Fuji Television Network for a possible tie-up which could pave the way for new innovation such as TV programs for cellphone users.

The mobile phone giant aims to reach an agreement by the end of the month to take a three percent share in Japan's most-watched network for 20 billion yen (170 million dollars), the Nihon Keizai Shimbun business daily reported.

DoCoMo would become the first telecom firm to invest in a terrestrial broadcasting station here, opening the way to integrate communications and broadcasting.

Through the tie-up, the two companies would seek to combine their expertise by launching TV programs especially for cellphone users from early next year, the newspaper said, quoting a company source.

An NTT DoCoMo spokesman confirmed the telecom firm was in talks with Fuji but declined to give further details.

DoCoMo believes teaming up with TV stations is crucial to expansion and would use the tie-up to establish similar partnerships with other broadcasters, the Nihon Keizai said.

For Fuji Television, which has been fending off takeover bids, the tie-up with such an established company would bring some welcome stability to its shareholder base.

"If we tie up with some telecommunications firm, that would be the NTT group in which we can place much confidence," said a Fuji Television senior official quoted by the business daily.

Upstart Internet firm Livedoor launched an unusually aggressive takeover bid in February for a crucial Fuji unit, Nippon Broadcasting System radio, in a bid to win control of the television giant.

Internet giant Rakuten also targetted broadcaster TBS for an aggressive takeover.

Both Internet firms, facing strong resistance from the broadcaster, ended up settling with limited capital tie-ups.

NTT DoCoMo, seeking to expand its operations in Asia, agreed Thursday to purchase a 10 percent stake in South Korea's second-largest mobile carrier KTF for about 560 million dollars.
