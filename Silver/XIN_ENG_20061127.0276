British Defense Secretary Des Browne said on Monday that British troops in Iraq would be "significantly lower by thousands" at the end of next year.

Addressing at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a leading think tank in UK, Browne said, "by the end of next year, I expect numbers of British forces in Iraq to be significantly lower by a matter of thousands."

"The planning for this has been going on for some months, and I have been pressing our planners to look at all the options, to make sure we do not ask a single soldier to remain in Iraq longer than is necessary," he said.

"In the end of course, it must depend on conditions on the ground, including the level of threat and the capacity of Iraqis to deal with it, and the final decision will be down to our commanders," he said.

Currently, Britain, a major U.S. ally in Iraq, has some 7,000 troops in southern Iraq, most in the Basra area and about 800 in Maysan province. Since 2003, there are 126 British soldiers killed in Iraq.
