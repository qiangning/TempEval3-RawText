German police said Saturday they had drawn a blank with a first search of a flat in Hamburg used by Dmitry Kovtun, a contact of the poisoned former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, for traces of the radioactive substance polonium 210.

"Hamburg police are taking every measure to check if polonium 210 is present in the apartment," they said in a statement.

A police spokesman said early Saturday the initial examination of the flat had come up with "no convincing result," but more in-depth tests would be needed.

Investigators believe Kovtun, a 41-year-old businessman, could have been in contact with the highly radioactive substance which killed Litvinenko on November 23.

Kovtun, one of three Russians who met Litvinenko in London on November 1, shortly before the former intelligence agent fell ill, was reported Friday to be suffering from radiation sickness.

Russia's Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed medical official in Moscow as saying that Kovtun had briefly fallen into a coma Thursday but had since recovered consciousness.

The death of Litvinenko from polonium poisoning, which British authorities are treating as murder, has prompted a media outcry, heightened by allegations from the dead agent's friends that he was killed on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Hamburg police appealed to "people who had any contact" with Kovtun to come forward. A special telephone number was available for concerned members of the public to call.
