A number of police officers were injured during clashes with protesters at several places near the venue of a meeting of the Group 20 (G20), which is being held Saturday in Melbourne, Australia's second largest city.

One police officer was taken to hospital with a suspected broken wrist when police tried to push back protesters who tried to break barricades surrounding the Grand Hyatt hotel in central Melbourne, where finance ministers and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union are gathering.

They will discuss issues including world economic conditions, energy security, demographic change, climate change and International Monetary Fund and the World Bank's reforms.

The protesters are about 2,700 people from an alliance of left- wing groups, anti-war activists, environmentalists and religious organizations.

Some protesters were seen throwing garbage bins at police.

Some protesters tried to pull down the barricades and police responded by striking the barricades, yelling at the protesters to back off.

The G20 is an informal forum which first met in December in 1999 following the Asian financial crisis. It brings together Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The European Union is also a member.

The group's members represent around 85 percent of global gross domestic, product, 80 percent of world trade and two-thirds of the world's population.
