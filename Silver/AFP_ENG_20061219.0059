Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko told South Korean business leaders Tuesday his country would be one of the world's fastest growing economies in a year or two, expanding 10 percent every year.

"Within a year or two, Ukraine will be regarded as one of the world's fastest growing economies," Yushchenko told them, calling for investment in his country.

"Ukraine's economy will be stabilized shortly and grow more than 10 percent every year," he was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.

Stressing that international ratings have been upgraded from stable to positive, Yushchenko said Ukraine has emerged as one of the world's largest recipients of foreign investment.

He suggested the two countries engage in joint projects including in nuclear energy, aerospace and the defence industry.

"Especially, there is a lot of interest in the fields of aerospace and the defence industry," Yushchenko told a press conference later Tuesday, noting that the two countries signed two agreements in those sectors on Monday.

"This is a very significant development in bilateral ties," he said.

At a summit with President Roh Moo-Hyun on Monday, Yushchenko said Ukraine's experience in scrapping its nuclear arsenal could be helpful in defusing the standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons programmes.

"The Ukranian side proposed to share the experience of its nuclear disarmament with the Korean side," a joint statement said.

Ukraine abandoned nuclear weapons in the 1990s in return for a collective security guarantee and economic assistance.

Roh and Yushchenko welcomed the resumption of six-party talks in Beijing this week and called for "substantive progress" in the dismantling of North Korean nuclear weapons, the statement said.

Yushchenko arrived here Monday for a two-day state visit.
