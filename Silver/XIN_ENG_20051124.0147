A roadside bomb hit an Iraqi army patrol north of Baghdad on Thursday, killing two soldiers, a local source told Xinhua.

"The explosion occurred in Baiji, around 200 km north of Baghdad. Another seven Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the blast," the source from the US-Iraqi Joint Coordination Center in Tikrit said.

Insurgents frequently target US and Iraqi military patrols with car bombs and roadside bombs in a bid to topple the US-backed government formed in April.
