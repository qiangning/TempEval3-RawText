Tong Wen, one of China's top judo players, Tuesday expressed her confidence over the upcoming Doha Asian Games.

Tong, who just arrived here with her teammates, looked relaxed with a big smile on her face. She said she did not know that her major rival, Japan's Olympic judo gold medalist Maki Tsukada has quit from the Games.

Tsukada withdrew from the 15th Asiad due to a calf injury, and was replaced by 20-year-old Mai Tateyama.

Tong said she doesn't know of Tateyama, saying that she will play her own way in the competition.

Japanese officials allegedly said Japan would sweep all women's judo gold medals in the Doha Games.

"The match results will not be decided by what they (Japanese officials) said," Tong said.
