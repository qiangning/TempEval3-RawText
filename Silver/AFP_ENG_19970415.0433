An Israeli millionaire accused of selling chemical arms material to Iran has been missing for several weeks, press reports said Tuesday.

Nahum Manbar, 51, an owner of a Jerusalem basketball team, had been accused by US President Bill Clinton of selling material used in making chemical arms to Iran.

Israel's leading newspapers, the Yediot, Haaretz and Maariv, all reported the story over his "mystery disappearance" and have made independent attempts to contact him.

Manbar, who lived mostly in France owes Israeli banks 150,000 dollars in loans he took for his business deals that totalled 8 million dollars.

Former business colleagues in Israel said Manbar did not always stick to his commitments in deals.

Manbar lived in Nice, France with his wife and two children, who also could not be found. Calls to his home in southern France were not answered.

But a secretary at his French office told Israeli Channel Two television that Manbar had not disappeared.

"When they decide to contact anyone, they will," the unnamed secretary told the television. "I can't say, I don't know where they are."

Manbar was born on the kibbutz Givat Hayim in northern Israel and left the country in 1985.

In 1991 the Israeli defense ministry forbade Israeli contacts with him based on reports he was selling chemical weapons parts to Iran, from China.

Clinton two years ago wrote in a letter to the US Congress that Manbar was involved in selling Iran materials used in the manufacture of chemical weapons.

The US government consequently imposed harsh sanctions on Manbar, preventing US businesses from working with him.

The New York Times reported in 1995 that Manbar had set up fake companies in Britain and Poland, through which he sold the weapons materials to Iran.

The materials, some of which had been produced in China, included those used to produce mustard and nerve gas, according to the New York Times.

Manbar told the Israeli Haaretz newspaper in 1995 that he had not sold such materials to Iran but clothes to protect against chemical attacks and that the appropriate Israeli officials knew of the deal.

Israeli officials told Yediot that Manbar had been the go-between for deals between military companies owned by the Israeli government and countries of the former Soviet Union.
