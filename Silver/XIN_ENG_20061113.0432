Eight people were trapped when a colliery was flooded in northeast China's Liaoning Province, the local government confirmed Tuesday.

The accident was reported at the Dahenan Colliery in Huazi Township in Dengta, a city about 50 kilometers south of the provincial capital Shenyang.

A spokesman of the provincial work safety administration said reports of the flood were received at 11:30 a.m. and it was not clear whether the victims were still alive.

He did not give the exact time of the accident.

Rescue work is underway and a team of reporters from Xinhua's Liaoning provincial bureau are on their way to the site.
