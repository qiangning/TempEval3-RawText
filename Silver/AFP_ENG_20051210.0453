Iceland's Unnur Birna Vilhjalmsdottir began her year-long reign as Miss World 2005 on Sunday after beating 101 other girls in a global pageant staged in this sleepy resort town.

The 21-year-old Reykjavik student and daughter of Miss Iceland 1983 expressed delight and astonishment at winning the title and thanked her mother for her advice.

"It came as a big shock but the feeling is incredible -- I am numb," said the green-eyed brunette. "I did not hear my name at first. I just heard it echo around the room. I only knew it was me because nobody else moved.

"My mum gave me some advice for how to behave, and it seems to have worked," Vilhjalmsdottir said. "She told me to be myself, not be fake in any way, and to relax. I am so pleased that she was able to be here to see me win the title."

Vilhjalmsdottir will serve as a goodwill ambassador and charity fund-raiser for children's causes throughout next year and is likely to profit from a host of modelling and acting contracts.

Organisers said Saturday night's pageant, in its 55th edition, reached an estimated audience of two billion.

Runner-up was Miss Mexico Dafne Molina Lona, representing the Americas, while the third place went to Miss Puerto Rico Ingrid Marie Rivera Santos, representing the Caribbean zone.

Vilhjalmsdottir' mother Unnur Steinsson represented Iceland in 1983 and came in the top five in the global contest.

"I am just speechless," Steinsson said. "There are simply no words to describe my feelings right now. I am now totally beside myself with joy to see her as Miss World."

Vilhjalmsdottir is a student from Reykjavik who has interned as a policewoman during her summer holidays while studying anthropology and aspiring toward a career in law.

Winning the coveted title is likely to change her life, as she embarks on a rigorous year of charity appearances and advocating humanitarian causes.

"In the coming year I want to do just as much as I can to help," she said. "I would love to do what I can do for charity and for the children of the world."

Vilhjalmsdottir beat finalists from six zones, including Miss Italy Sofia Bruscoli, awarded the title of Miss South Europe, Miss Tanzania Nancy Abraham Sumary, who was named Miss Africa, and Miss Korea Eun-Young Oh, who was crowned Miss Asia Pacific.

The cherished title "Beauty With A Purpose" also went to Miss Korea, an award commemorating her humanitarian fund-raising and charity work.

Miss Russia Yulia Ivanova won the bathing suit section, while Miss America Virgin Islands Kmisha-Victoria Counts won the talent contest with her soul singing.

This year, for the first time, all nine judges were former Miss World title holders, including Miss World 1953 Denise Perrier Lanfranchi of France.

Vilhjalmsdottir takes over from Maria Julia Mantilla Garcia, who in a year of globetrotting visited tsunami-hit Banda Aceh in Indonesia as well as Russia, Tibet and her native Peru, where she worked to improve children's education.

Sanya, a quiet tropical resort on the southern tip of China's Hainan Island began holding the Miss World Pageant in 2003.

The venue of next year's contest has not yet been announced, but hopes here are that the event returns to this tropical island that is set to become booming China's top vacation spot.
