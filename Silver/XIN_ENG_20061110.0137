Zimbabwe's National AIDS Council ( NAC) has attributed the decline in the AIDS prevalence rate to various projects such as the home-based care system which deals with people living with the HIV/AIDS virus, local media reported on Friday.

The Zimbabwe Independent quoted NAC board chairman Murombedzi Kuchera as saying that the awareness campaigns being carried out by various stakeholders nationwide were helping reduce the prevalence rate.

The prevalence rate for the HIV virus is now down at 18.1 percent from the previous 20.1 percent, while projections point to a reduction to a single digit rate by 2010, he said.

"Home-based care is one of the very important strategies in national efforts to address challenges faced by AIDS victims at home," he said.

Zimbabwe has over 300,000 people who require anti-retroviral drugs, but only 42,000 of them are receiving treatment. The remainder have to be catered for through home-based care initiatives.

The NAC said it was receiving 250,000 US dollars for anti- retroviral drugs every month from the central bank to cater for those who cannot survive without the drugs.
