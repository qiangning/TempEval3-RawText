Francois Lumumba, the son of the late hero of Zairean independence, on Thursday said there was nothing wrong with foreign help to rebels seeking to oust President Mobutu Sese Seko.

The son of Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister who was murdered in February 1961, less than a year after independence, added in Geneva that he planned to go to Goma in eastern Zaire for a meeting with rebel leader Laurent Kabila.

Kabila's rebel alliance, in which Zairean Tutsis hold key posts, benefits from diplomatic support and facilities to ship in arms through Uganda, Sudan and Rwanda, Lumumba told the press.

"We don't have any complexes if people give us certain facilities to finish off the Mobutu regime," he said. Mobutu has ruled Zaire for more than 31 years and was deeply implicated in events surrounding Lumumba's death and a foiled secession bid by the mineral-rich province of Katanga (now Shaba), which is once again in rebel hands.

Lumumba, 45, was passing through Geneva after visiting Washington for talks with State Department officials and some 30 black American congressmen. He had lived in exile in Switzerland between 1975 and 1980.

The son of Patrice Lumumba, whose murder sparked outrage in much of Africa, now lives in the Zairean capital Kinshasa and plans to return there after going to Goma on the eastern border with Rwanda.

He heads the Lumumba National Congolese Movement (MNCL), which is not part of the rebel alliance, but is prepared to work with it for the overthrow of Mobutu and to take part in a transitional government.

Lumumba said his party would put up a candidate in presidential elections that should follow the toppling of Mobutu, but the choice of candidate had not yet been made.

He claimed that the MNCL had many supporters, some of whom were taking part in the armed uprising. He ruled out a transition government including the current head of state, saying "Forget Mobutu."

His father called for help from the Soviet Union following the Katanga secession bid in 1960. Arrested by then Colonel Mobutu in December, he died two months later, allegedly in an attempt to escape.
