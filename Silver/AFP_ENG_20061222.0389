The Security Council on Friday agreed a one-year extension of the mandate of the UN mission in Sierra Leone to help the Freetown government consolidate peace and prepare general elections due next July.

The 15-member council also unanimously passed a resolution endorsing departing UN chief Kofi Annan's call for boosting by 15 officers the 298-strong UN mission for the January 1-October 31 2007 period to help Sierra Leone's security sector carry out its election-related responsibilities.

The resolution extends the mandate of the mission known as the UN Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) until December 31, 2007.

It calls on all parties in Sierra Leone "to demonstrate their full commitment to the democratic process and to ensure that the 2007 presidential and parliamentary elections are peaceful, transparent and free and fair."

With some 17,500 troops at the peak of the brutal civil war which officially ended in 2002, the UN deployed in Sierra Leone what was then the largest UN peacekeeping operation in the world.

The UN troops were withdrawn last December and replaced by UNIOSIL.

In his latest report on Sierra Leone, Annan, who is stepping down on December 31 after 10 years at the helm of the world body, said the security situation there "remained stable, but still fragile".

He cited the "high level of youth unemployment, the poor social and economic conditions of the people and the general public perception of the government's mismanagement of public resources" as the most serious threats to the country's "tenuous stability".

Annan, who visited Sierra Leone last July, described next year's elections as "a major milestone, which should help define an exit strategy for UNIOSIL."

To avoid resumption of hostilities, the UN is providing help from its Peacebuilding Commission, a panel tasked with helping fragile countries make the difficult transition from war to peace.

Sierra Leone endured a decade-long civil war which was brought to an end in 2002 with the help of Britain and UN peacekeepers.

More than 17,000 foreign troops disarmed tens of thousands of rebels and militia fighters in the biggest UN peacekeeping success in Africa for many years after debacles in the 1990s in Angola, Rwanda and Somalia.
