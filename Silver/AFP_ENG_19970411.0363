Swedish environmentalists rallied outside the Dutch embassy here on Friday to urge the Netherlands to release the founder of their group, Paul Watson, wanted in Norway for illegal protest actions against whaling, police said.

Half a dozen environmentalists of the Sea Shepherd group brandished banners outside the embassy urging "Please Holland, free Paul Watson."

Watson, a 46-year old Canadian citizen who is also the co-founder of Greenpeace, was arrested at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on April 2 under an international arrest warrant.

He is wanted by Norwegian authorities, who have requested his extradition in connection with a collision in July 1992 between his Sea Shepherd Conservation Society boat and a whaler during an operation by environmentalists against whale-hunting.

Watson had been sentenced in Norway to 120 days imprisonment for damage to the whaling ship Nybraenna. He is also wanted in Norway for two other illegal protest actions against whaling.

In July 1994, a Sea Shepherd boat rammed a Norwegian coast guard vessel during an operation by environmentalists against whale-hunting, and in January 1994 he sabotaged the whaler Senet.

Dutch diplomat Rienko Wilton told AFP that Friday's demonstration was "very peaceful."
