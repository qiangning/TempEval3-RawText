Britain's Princes William and Harry unveiled Tuesday plans for a huge pop concert next year to mark the 10th anniversary of the death of their mother Diana, princess of Wales.

The charity "Concert for Diana" -- featuring Sir Elton John among others -- is due to be held at the currently unfinished new Wembley Stadium on July 1, which would have been her 46th birthday.

In a rare interview, William, 24, and Harry, 22, also said a memorial service would take place in London on August 31 -- exactly 10 years on from the princess's death in a Paris car crash.

Top acts from Britain and the United States are expected to perform at the concert before up to 90,000 fans, with the event likely to be televised live worldwide.

The acts are chosen by the princes, with many reflective of their late mother's tastes.

"It's to remember her and to commemorate her life and celebrate it," William said. "We want it to represent exactly what our mother would have wanted, how she was.

"We wanted to have this big concert, full of energy, full of the sort of fun and happiness which I know she would have wanted.

"And on her birthday as well, it's got to be the best birthday present she ever had."

John, who performed at Diana's funeral, will play, as will the princess's favourite band Duran Duran.

Singers Bryan Ferry and Joss Stone, plus US rapper Pharrell Williams will also appear as will further acts yet to be announced.

Diana's love of musicals and dancing will also be recognised with a performance by the English National Ballet while composer Andrew Lloyd Webber will put on a medley of songs from his stage shows.

Harry said he and his brother would likely appear at the start.

Royals and Diana's relatives will attend the memorial service in a rare show of unity.

"The service is going to include both sides of the family, our mother's side and our father's side -- everyone getting together," Harry said.

Diana's brother Earl Charles Spencer ruffled feathers at her funeral by vowing his family would ensure the princes were not confined to stuffy royal circles.

But Spencer and his sisters are to attend, along with Queen Elizabeth II, Diana's former husband Prince Charles, and his second wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. The pair had an affair while Charles and Diana were still married.

Diana married Charles, the heir to the throne, in July 1981 and was a hugely popular member of Britain's royal family. The couple separated in December 1992 and divorced in August 1996.

Diana was killed in a Paris car crash in August 1997 along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and his chauffeur Henri Paul.

A long-awaited report into Diana's death will confirm a French probe that it was an accident and refute theories of a plot by British intelligence, news leaks said Sunday.

The new Wembley Stadium in northwest London has run vastly over-budget and been repeatedly delayed. The 757-million-pound (1.5-billion-dollar, 1.1-billion-euro) venue is now scheduled to open in May.

Tickets costing 45 pounds (88 dollars, 67 euros) go on sale from 0900 GMT Wednesday via the www.concertfordiana.com website.
