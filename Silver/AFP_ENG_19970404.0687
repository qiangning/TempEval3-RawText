A fairly strong earthquake measuring 4.9 on the Richter scale rocked southern Japan Saturday, the meteorological agency said.

There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.

An agency official said the quake, which struck at 1:24 p.m. (0424 GMT), was believed to be an aftershock of a strong quake on March 26, which had a magnitude of 6.2, injured at least 20 people and caused landslides.

The epicenter of the quake was located in Kagoshima prefecture, the agency said.
