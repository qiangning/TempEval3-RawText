Sale of the 2002 book co-written by the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko who died of suspected radioactive poisoning are selling on the Internet at up to 30 times their orginal price.

"Dear Diane. Thank you for the help and support!" the former Russian secret service agent signed.

The book, co-written by the US-based Russian historian Yuri Felshtinsky, argues that the Federal Security Services (FSB) -- a successor to the KGB -- co-ordinated a series of blasts in Moscow and other Russian cities in 1999.

The explosions, which took place over a two-month period, are thought to have killed more than 300 people.

Russian authorities blamed Chechen separatists and allegedly used the blasts as an excuse for a renewed offensive against the breakaway former Soviet republic.

The book also claims that the Russian secret services organised a number of assassinations and kidnappings.
