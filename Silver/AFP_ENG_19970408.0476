China's capital city plans to lead the country to use of less- polluting unleaded fuel, the official Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday.

Beginning July 1, unleaded petrol will be available at 300 filling stations across the city, the report said.

It cited Machinery Ministry efforts to develop catalytic converters -- which allow existing vehicles to use unleaded petrol -- but did not specify whether measures would be taken to compel use of the cleaner- burning fuel.

China's four other main cities, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, will gradually adopt similar measures, Xinhua said.

Heavy air pollution in Beijing caused by use of coal in factories and households has worsened in recent years as the number of vehicles on the road has grown.
