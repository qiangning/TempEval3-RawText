South Korea and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are expected to sign a military agreement this week to strengthen their cooperation, the South Korean Defense Ministry said Tuesday.

South Korean Vice Defense Minister Hwang Kyu-sik, who left for the UAE on Tuesday on a four-day trip, will sign an agreement with UAE officials on Wednesday, the ministry said, adding that the agreement would help increase exchanges between the two countries' militaries as well as their defense-related industries.

Hwang was also expected to discuss ways to expand South Korea's exports of weapons to the UAE during his visit, the ministry said.
