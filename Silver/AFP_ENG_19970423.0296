United Arab Emirates (UAE) investors are racing to subscribe in the world's biggest Islamic bank that is to be set up by the oil-rich Gulf states, dealers said Wednesday.

Many of them have sold shares in other institutions to secure cash for their stake in the Emirates Islamic Bank (EISB), which will be based in Abu Dhabi and partly owned by the UAE government, they said.

"I have been flooded with queries about the date of the subscription, which I expect to begin within a few weeks," said Bassam al-Ramahi, deputy manager of the Emirates Commercial Centre, a leading brokerage house.

"Many dealers are selling their shares to get cash to contribute to the bank. I am sure that the bank's capital will be far oversubscribed because the government participation gives confidence to investors," he told AFP.

Bankers said the central bank had already approved the project and it would be launched once its statute is finalized. The state-owned Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and other official institutions are among the key shareholders.

The project had initially been called the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and was confined to investors from the emirate. But it was changed to cover the whole UAE following applications by other emirates to set up similar banks.

The official daily Al-Bayan said the bank would have a paid-up capital of 1.2 billion dirhams (326 million dollars) and an authorised capital of three billion dirhams (817 million dollars).

"Our expectations are that subscription would reach double the authorised capital in a short period of time given the large liquidity in the market. This could prompt shareholders to raise the paid-up capital," Ramahi said.

The venture will be the biggest Islamic bank in the world in terms of capital. The Cairo-based Faisal Bank is currently the top Islamic bank.

EISB is the second Islamic bank in the UAE after the Dubai Islamic Bank, at present the second biggest in the world, with a capital of 135.6 million dollars.

Al-Bayan did not specify the size of the government's shareholding in EISB but bankers expect it to be less than 50 percent. They said investors from other Gulf Arab states would be given a limited access to the project.

"This project it highly feasible and I am certain there will be a rush by investors," said Zuhair Kaswani, another UAE stockbroker.

"The UAE has a large number of banks but the market here and in other regional states can accommodate more given the expanding business opportunities. As you see, most banks are making high profits every year."

The UAE, a major OPEC oil-producer, has 19 national banks and 28 foreign units, with assets of around 46 billion dollars. It has suspended permits for new foreign commercial banks but allowed opening of representative offices.

EISB was planned after several other Middle East banks opened Islamic banking units to take advantage of the growing demand for such operations.

"There are two main factors for the expected success of the EISB project. The first is that there is a growing tendency by the public to invest in Islamic banks for religious reasons," Ramahi said.

"The second factor is purely economic. Most Islamic banks here are now ensuring higher returns for investors compared with commercial banks."

Islamic banks do not deal in interest which is prohibited in Islam as usury. Their main activities cover financing of projects and charging a percentage of the profits as well as trading in property, cars and other items.
