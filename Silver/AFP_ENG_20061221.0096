Turkmenistan's exiled opposition is preparing a return to the Central Asian country following the death Thursday of President Saparmurat Niyazov, the Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported, citing a leader in exile.

"We will definitely fly there in two or three days," Nurmukhammed Khanamov, head of the exiled Republican Party, was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying.

"An opposition coalition government must be formed," he also said, adding that the three main opposition parties abroad were preparing to unite so that "there will not be anarchy and conflict in the country."

"The most important thing is to do this all by the law," he said.

Niyazov died earlier Thursday of a heart attack, according to an official statement. During his 20-year rule he allowed no political opposition.
