JP Morgan net profits fell 3.4 percent to 424 million dollars in the first quarter from 439 million dollars in the same period last year, the bank announced Thursday.

Net profit per share was 2.04 dollars against 2.13 last year.

Sales rose to 1.83 billion dollars, from 1.74 billion.

JP Morgan Chairman Douglas Warner said the company's "good" first quarter result was based on higher revenues and increasing global diversification, noting that client activity "remains strong" into the second quarter.

The company's Finance and Advisory unit's revenues increased eight percent to 451 million dollars, mainly as a result of higher debt and equity underwriting revenues.

Market making revenues fell 38 million dollars 733 million with revenues in emerging markets, equities, and foreign exchange up strongly, while fixed income revenues in developed markets fell from the "high" levels of 1996, Warner said.

Asset Management and Servicing revenues increased nine percent to 375 million dollars.
