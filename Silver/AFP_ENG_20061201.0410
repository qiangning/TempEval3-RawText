The Italian government said Friday it would sell half of its controlling interest in flag carrier Alitalia, inviting investors to bid for about 25 percent of the loss-making airline.

Italy currently owns 49.9 percent of Alitalia and had previously pledged not to reduce its holding below 30 percent.

But a government statement said: "The decision was taken in accordance with intentions to seek strategic international alliances, with a possible final decision regarding Alitalia's future to be taken by January 2007."

Shares in the airline jumped sharply higher, provoking two suspensions but showing a gain of 11.15 percent to 0.944 euros in afternoon trades on the Milan stock exchange, where the SP/Mib index had gained 0.38 percent overall.

"At first glance this is a radical change for Alitalia and a positive event for its shareholders," said a Milan-based trader, who asked not to be named.

The statement said the sale would be carried out through "a competitive procedure and direct negotiations".

A senior aide to Prime Minister Romano Prodi quoted Environment Minister Alfonso Scanio as saying that around 25 percent of Alitalia would be put up for sale, bringing the state's stake below 30 percent.

The sale represents "finalisation of the company's privatisation," the government's statement said.

It had reduced its holding from 62.3 percent to 49.9 percent in late 2005 as the result of a one-billion-euro (1.32-billion-dollar) capital increase but pledged at the time to retain at least 30 percent of the national flag carrier.

Alitalia chief executive Giancarlo Cimoli told lawmakers Wednesday however that the airline's future depended on forming an alliance with an international group.

"The only strategic direction for Alitalia is to integrate itself in a big international group," he told a parliamentary commission.

"The board has given me a mandate to explore (possible alliances)," Cimoli added.

Air France-KLM and Alitalia last week revealed that they had begun tentative talks on a possible tie-up, but the French airline has laid down restructuring of Alitalia as a condition for any deal.

Alitalia said in November that its losses this year would surpass the 167 million euros (214 million dollars) it reported for 2005.

In the first nine months of the year, it recorded a pre-tax loss of 276 million euros, against 168 million in the same period of 2005.

Alitalia and Air France-KLM have already exchanged two percent of the shares in each of their companies, but Cimoli told lawmakers he would also consider options with other partners.

The Italian government has appeared divided on whether to favor a European partner or an Asian carrier, but Prodi has promised to define a strategy for the Italian airline by the end of January.

A spokeswoman for the German carrier Lufthansa indicated Friday that it was not planning to bid on the stake, saying: "We've nothing in the pipeline."

But she also refused to confirm or deny the possibility of Lufthansa taking a stake in Alitalia in the future.

"You never know what will happen in the coming weeks," she said.

Italian infrastructure minister Antonio Di Pietro said the government's decision should convince Alitalia's management to resign.

"With today's decision the exit doors are open for those who occupy positions of power at Alitalia because they have failed in their mission," he said.
