U.S. consumer prices dropped by 0.5 percent in October, registering the second consecutive monthly decline, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.

The 0.5 percent drop in the department's Consumer Price Index, an inflation barometer on consumer price levels, matched the decline in September and was better than the 0.3 percent dip expected by analysts.

It was the first back-to-back drops in consumer prices since late last year, providing evidence that inflation pressures started to ease because of declining energy prices and a slowing economy.

The October drop in consumer prices was helped by a decrease of 7 percent in energy prices, which followed a 7.2 percent decline in September.

Gasoline prices plunged by 11.1 percent in October, while prices of natural gas and home heating oil also posted big declines.

However, food costs edged up 0.3 percent in October. Beef, pork and vegetable prices increased but poultry and fruit prices declined.

Excluding volatile food and energy, the "core" consumer prices rose by 0.1 percent in October, the smallest since a similar 0.1 percent increase in February.

Over the past 12 months, "core" inflation is up by 2.7 percent, above the Federal Reserve's comfort zone of increases in the range of 1 percent to 2 percent.

Policymakers at the central bank are hoping that the slowing economy will eventually put inflation in control. During the two years till June 2006, interest rates were increased by 4.25 percentage points, trying to produce a soft landing for the economy.

The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with gains of 2.6 percent in the second quarter and 5.6 percent in the first quarter.
