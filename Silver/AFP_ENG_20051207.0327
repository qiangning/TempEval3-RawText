Estonia has protested to the Russian authorities after a Russian military plane breached the Baltic state's air space in the fifth such violation this year, officials said Wednesday.

"A Russian military transport An-26 entered Estonian airspace without permission Tuesday," the Estonian defence forces said in a statement.

"The plane, flying towards Kaliningrad, entered Estonian airspace near the island of Vaindloo in the Gulf of Finland."

The Russian plane, which posed no threat to civilian air traffic, was picked up on the radar of the Estonian Air Sovereignty Centre and left the Baltic state's air space after it was contacted by Estonian officials.

Kaliningrad is a heavily militarised Russian enclave which lies to the south of the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which joined NATO last year.

NATO member countries take turns patrolling the skies of the Baltic states, which were incorporated into the Soviet Union after World War II and regained independence in 1991.
