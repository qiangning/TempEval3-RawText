A total of 406 people have died from drinking illicit liquor in a wave of alcohol poisoning in numerous Russian regions over the past few months, the head of the country's consumer rights watchdog agency said on Tuesday.

Gennady Onishchenko, chief of the Federal Service for Consumer Rights Supervision, said some 10,000 cases of toxic hepatitis caused by toxic alcohol substitutes have been registered in 18 regions, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.

The hardest hit were the Irkutsk, Chelyabinsk and Belgorod regions, where 107 people have been affected and 16 of them died in the past 24 hours alone, Onishchenko said.

A total of 406 deaths from toxic alcohol substitutes have occurred in Russia over the past several months, he added.

The massive wave of poisoning has raised alarm in the country, with top lawmakers calling for state monopoly over alcohol products to help crack down on fake vodka and toxic alcohol substitutes.
