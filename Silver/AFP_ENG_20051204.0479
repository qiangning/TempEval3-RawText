Fourteen men accused of belonging to a radical Muslim terrorist group, including the convicted killer of filmmaker Theo van Gogh, go on trial Monday at Amsterdam's high security court.

The murder of outspoken Islam critic Van Gogh and the subsequent arrests of the alleged members of the terror ring dubbed the Hofstad group have heightened fears that the country is a target for Islamic terrorists.

However, prosecutors have already suffered setbacks, being forced to drop charges the group was specifically planning to kill several Dutch politicians, and losing a similar case against another accused terrorist.

Prosecutor Koos Plooy has admitted that they have insufficient evidence to proceed with charges the group was planning specific attacks, but said they were definitely heading that way.

The prosecution alleges that 27-year-old Mohammed Bouyeri, convicted to life in prison for murdering Van Gogh, was a leading member of the Hofstad group.

Despite the fact that he already has the maximum sentence given in the Netherlands, the prosecution also wants Bouyeri to appear in the Hofstad group trial because if his alleged key role.

Prosecutors say that the majority of the group's meetings were held in Bouyeri's Amsterdam home and that he spread radical Islamic texts among its members.

Some of the others charged have been linked to a radical Islamist jailed in Spain for the May 2003 bombings in Casablanca, Morocco that left 45 people dead.

The group was dubbed the Hofstad (court city) group as some of its members were active in The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government and the royal house.

Besides the accusations of membership in a terrorist organisation, the prosecution has filed additional charges against two of the group's members for throwing a grenade at the police team coming to arrest them in The Hague in November 2004.

A weapons charge has been pressed against one member who was arrested in Amsterdam last June with a loaded gun.

According to NOS Dutch public television there was some concrete evidence that this suspect, Nourredine El Fatmi, was planning an attack. Quoting from prosecution documents they obtained the NOS said Fatmi apparently told a fellow inmate that he was looking for two Dutch politicians known for their criticism of Islam in the days before his arrest.

The judges of the court in The Hague handling the trial will exceptionally sit in Amsterdam's high security court, nicknamed the bunker, during the trial set to last at least two months.

The first two days of the case will be taken up with the prosecution's opening statement and the questioning of (expert) witnesses relevant to all cases.

The trial is set to close February 10 after all the suspects have gotten a change to make a final declaration and the judges are expected to hand down a verdict on February 24.
