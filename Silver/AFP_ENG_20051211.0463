California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was expected to decide on Monday whether to spare ex-gang leader Stanley "Tookie" Williams, whose death sentence is to be executed early Tuesday.

Williams, whose case has prompted an international campaign for clemency, faces the death penalty for murdering four people unless the governor intervenes before Tuesday.

Hollywood celebrities, including Jamie Foxx and Danny Glover, African-American leaders and opponents of the death penalty have championed Williams' case, citing his work against gang violence.

The governor is the only man who can halt the death of Williams, who has been on death row for two decades and who is sentenced to die by lethal injection at 00:01 (0801 GMT) Tuesday.

The "Terminator" movie star turned politician heard final arguments on Thursday from prosecutors and defense lawyers, who had 30 minutes each to make their cases in a private hearing at the governor's office in Sacramento.

Schwarzenegger's office said no decision on the case was expected on Sunday, but was likely to be announced on Monday.

Williams, 51, has insisted he is innocent of the murders but has renounced his gangster past, writing several children's books.

His lawyers argued that he has had a change of heart displayed by his work to turn others against gang violence and asked for his death sentence to be commuted to life in prison without parole.

The founder of the notorious Crips gang in Los Angeles who has appealed to youth to avoid gangs has been nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize.

The prosecutor who secured Williams' conviction in 1981, Robert Martin, said on US television Sunday that the former gang leader did not deserve clemency because he had failed to show remorse for the shotgun murders of four people during two robberies.

"If he does not take responsibility for the four brutal murders that he committed, he can't begin to be rehabilitated, and we can't say that there's a moral equivalency between four brutal murders and co-authoring some children's books," Martin told on "Fox News on Sunday."

"I think society is not going to accept that," he said.

Schwarzenegger said last week that the decision he faced was "very tough".

Decisions on whether to spare convicted killers such as Williams from execution "are very heavy responsibilities," the one-time champion body builder said.

The first-term governor has refused clemency appeals in two other death row cases.

California's highest court last month rejected a request to take a new look at evidence that put Williams on death row.

The defense team for Williams says it has received "tens of thousands" of letters and e-mails contending that Williams' anti-gang message is reaching city streets and juvenile detention facilities.
