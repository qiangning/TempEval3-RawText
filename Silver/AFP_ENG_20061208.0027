US stocks ended higher Friday after a government report showed an improving job market last month as employers added a better-than-expected 132,000 nonfarm positions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 29.08 points (0.24 percent) at 12,307.49 just after the closing bell.

The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite gained 9.67 points (0.40 percent) to 2,437.36 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index added 2.55 points (0.18 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,409.84.

The Labor Department said that US employers added 132,000 jobs in November in a report that suggested overall economic growth remains on track days before the Federal Reserve meets to deliberate interest rates.

Merger speculation rose as Merrill Lynch banking analysts meanwhile said in a research report that they believe Bank of America is "very interested" in acquiring Barclays bank of Britain.

The banking analysts said such a potential deal would be profitable even if Bank of America had to pay a 25-to-30 percent premium to acquire Barclays.

"We don't comment on market rumors or speculation," said Scott Silvestri, a Bank of America spokesman.
