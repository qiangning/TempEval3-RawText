The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) on Tuesday said a 750-million-US-dollar loan had been granted for the construction of the Tocoma hydropower project in Venezuela.

The Washington-based multi-lateral funding body said the money would fund programs in engineering, administration, environmental and social management.

The loan is the biggest ever granted since Luis Alberto Moreno assumed the presidency of the IDB on Oct. 3.

The IDB said in a release that it had approved the loan on the basis that the project would improve Venezuela's power supply and economic competitiveness, creating a more environmentally sustainable power source for economic development, compared with the existing alternatives.

The Tocoma project, the fourth one in the Lower Caroni River Valley,with an installed capacity of 2,160 megawatts, costs a total of 3 billion US dollars.
