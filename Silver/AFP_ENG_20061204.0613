UN chief Kofi Annan on Monday opened a high-level conference here that turned the spotlight on continuing sexual exploitation and abuses by a minority of UN peacekeepers serving around the world.

"Acts of sexual exploitation and abuse by both civilian and uniformed UN personnel continue," the outgoing secretary general told a gathering of more than 100 senior leaders from the world body, non-governmental organizations, UN member states, academics and victim advocates.

"There have been crimes such as rape, paedophilia and human trafficking. My message of zero tolerance has still not got through to those who need to hear it -- from managers on the ground, to all our other personnel."

Monday's conference came close on the heels of a BBC expose that found allegations of child prostitution and rape involving the UN peacekeeping missions in Haiti and Liberia.

In an interview with the BBC last week, UN Assistant Secretary General for peacekeeping operations Jane Holl Lute conceded that the abuse reported in Haiti "is going on ... and I don't challenge the facts as they were presented".

She insisted, however, that the United Nations was working to deal with cases of abuse by peacekeepers, telling the broadcaster that the UN had "accepted our responsibility for dealing comprehensively with this."

Monday, participants at the one-day conference approved a statement in which they reaffirmed their determination to prevent future acts of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN and non-governmental organization (NGO) personnel.

They specifically committed themselves to implementing 10 key goals, including developing organization-specific strategies to deal with the problem, incorporating standards on induction materials and training courses for their personnel and preventing perpetrators of abuse from being "(re-) hired or (re-) deployed."

Other goals include taking appropriate action to "protect persons from retaliation" where allegations of sexual abuse are reported, investigate allegation "in a timely and professional manner" and providing "basic emergency assistance to complainants".
