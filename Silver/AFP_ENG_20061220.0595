The European Union should show unity over Kosovo to avoid a long-awaited decision on the Serbian province's final status being delayed further into 2007, the International Crisis group said Wednesday.

The warning came amid election campaigning in Serbia for January 21 polls, in which Kosovo's aspirations for independence are playing an important role.

"A number of EU states are showing signs that they are reluctant to change Kosovo's status in the face of continued Serbian opposition," the Brussels-based thinktank said in a statement.

"If Brussels fails to coalesce quickly around a strong internal consensus, it risks inheriting a major new crisis," it said, noting that Germany faces an "urgent challenge" as it takes over the EU presidency next month.

Kosovo has been run by a United Nations mission since 1999, when a NATO bombing campaign ended a crackdown by Belgrade on separatist ethnic Albanian rebels in the province.

The UN envoy to Kosovo, Martti Ahtisaari, began negotiations in February with Serbian and Kosovo authorities to define the future status of the province.

He was due to make recommendations to the UN by the end of the year, but has now said that he will reveal his plans for the future of the majority ethnic-Albanian region after the Serbian elections.

"It is a fact of life that the risk of implosion does become greater the deeper Kosovo goes into 2007 without its status settled," the group said.

It said Ahtisaari's proposals are not likely to explicitly use the term "independence" for Kosovo, but that it expects him to build a strong case for such a future.

"The incoming German presidency should make uniting member states behind the Ahtisaari proposals a top priority," it said.

It noted that Germany and Italy appeared to prefer to wait until Serbia has formed a new government, while Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Romania were also listed as close to Serbia's position.

On Friday, EU leaders sent a signal to Belgrade that its future lies in Europe.

But they encouraged it to cooperate with the United Nations war crimes court seeking former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic, believed to have been in hiding in Serbia.

The EU froze talks on closer ties with Serbia in May over its failure to cooperate fully with the Hague-based tribunal, but a number of countries have been pushing for negotiations to resume.
