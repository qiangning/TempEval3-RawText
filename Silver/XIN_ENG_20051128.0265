LUANDA, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) - Sao Tome and Principe's Prime Minister Maria do Carmo Silveira said Monday here at the start of a three-day visit to Luanda that the Archipelago wanted strengthened ties with Angola, above all in its emerging oil sector.

After a meeting with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Silveira said that "We would like this visit to represent a qualitative step in re-enforcing our cooperative relations, giving them a strategic orientation and concentrating them in areas considered priorities by the two countries."

Noting that Angola had "a long experience" in the oil sector, Silveira said Luanda's aid in this area was of "extreme importance " to its Gulf of Guinea archipelago.

Silveira said she had also discussed Sao Tome's 20 million US dollars debt to Angola with dos Santos, adding that she had asked the president to view the case in the framework of her government' s hopes of getting a debt pardon from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund early next year.

"We asked (dos Santos) for our debt to Angola to be analyzed in this context," Silveira said, noting that the issue would be dealt with in an upcoming meeting of the two countries' bilateral commission.

Later Monday, delegations led by Silveira and her Angolan counterpart, Fernando Dias dos Santos, are scheduled to begin discussions on business cooperation and air and sea links, among other matters, officials said.

Earlier this year, Sao Tome invited Angola, Brazil and Portugal to join it in setting up a four-way consortium for oil exploration in its territorial waters and in the Joint Development Zone shared with Nigeria.

While Sao Tome's three partners responded positively to that idea, there has been no recent word of any concrete move towards creating a consortium.
