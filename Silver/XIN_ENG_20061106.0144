The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) adopted a Greek proposal to aid small and medium-sized enterprises, Greek Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas said on Monday.

Under the government proposal, a mechanism would be created to provide an information and cooperation link that would allow smaller firms to learn about access to global markets from multinationals, Sioufas said.

Sioufas made the remarks at the opening of a three-day conference in Athens sponsored by the OECD, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Development Ministry.

"Although small and medium-sized enterprises are less well equipped to make use of opportunities on an international level in comparison with large firms, they have tremendous potential. It has been estimated that if they employ all their resources for exports, they will achieve the same exports volume as large companies," he noted.

"But an outward-looking approach is required to ensure their competitiveness and viability. That is why the Greek government proposed the mechanism, which has been accepted by the OECD's deputy general secretary," the minister said.

The conference aims to identify cost effective mechanisms to remove barriers to market-access, and promote internationalization of the enterprises.

Best-practice support programs put in place by governments, at both national and local levels to assist in dealing with the impediments, will be reviewed.

The conference is part of the OECD Bologna Process on small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurship policies. The Athens meeting follows an OECD ministerial conference in June 2004 in Istanbul, where ministers adopted a declaration pledging cooperative action in reducing barriers to access. The declaration also invited the OECD, working with countries and international organizations, to identify ways in which barriers could be lifted.
