Population growth in the Netherlands is curbed both by declining birth rate and increasing number of emigrants, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) reported Thursday.

New births in the first nine months of 2005 fell to 142,000, 4, 000 less than the same period of 2004, while 89,000 people moved out of the country in the same period, an increase of the same margin than a year before.

The population increased by less than 25,000 in the first nine months of 2005. This is 7,000 less than in the same period of 2004, CBS figures show.

Population growth started slowing down in 2000. In the first nine months of that year the number of inhabitants increased by over 90,000.

The birth rate is expected to decrease even further over the next few years, said the CBS.

It is expected that 190,000 children will be born in the whole year of 2005, whereas some 207,000 children were born in the year 2000. The number of births is expected to drop below 180,000 by 2010.

A major cause of the decline is the falling birth rate in the early 1970s, which means the number of women aged around 30 is decreasing. Then there is the downward effect of the unfavorable economic situation, said the CBS.

There are more and more children whose parents remain unmarried. In the first nine months of 2005, one in three children was extra- marital, compared to one in six 10 years ago. Almost half of all first children born in 2005 were born outside marriage.

On Jan. 1, 2005 there were a quarter of a million unmarried couples with children. Ten years earlier there were less than 100, 000.
