An Italian colonel serving with the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) in Bosnia was found dead Wednesday morning at an SFOR base in this southern city, a spokesman said.

Colonel Roberto Petrucci, 57, was shot with a bullet fired from his own gun, SFOR spokesman Mike Fabbro told AFP, adding that suicide was suspected.

Petrucci had served with the Italian army's artillery school at Bracciano near Rome and arrived in Bosnia in late January, Fabbro said.
