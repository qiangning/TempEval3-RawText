Italy's Lucia Recchia crashed at high speed in Friday's women's World Cup downhill and was airlifted to hospital.

Starting from the 18th spot, the 26-year-old Recchia apparently lost a ski and hit a gate shortly after starting her run, then before crashed through the safety netting on the side of the course.

She was put on a stretcher and airlifted off the mountain by helicopter to a waiting ambulance.

Recchia was conscious as ski patrol and medical staff assisted her on the mountain.
