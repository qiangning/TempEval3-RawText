Xu Kun of China won the Asian Games men's 50m Pistol individual gold medal here on Tuesday even as team-mate and world number two Tan Zongliang struggled to finish fifth.

Rashid Yunusmetov of Kazakhstan took the silver and Kim Jong Su of North Korea the bronze at the Lusail ranges.

China had also won the team event in the same competition earlier on Tuesday and now have 14 gold medals from the 20 shooting events contested so far.

Tan's hopes of winning a third gold medal in Doha after securing the 10m Air Pistol team and individual titles evaporated after he shot poorly in the second round.
