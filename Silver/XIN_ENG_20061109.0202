The United Nations Secretary General's personal representative to Nepal, Ian Martin, held discussion with the guerrillas' leadership on arms management process on Thursday.

The hour-long meeting was focused on the technicalities of setting up cantonments and arms storages as agreed between the Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) and the guerrillas recently.

The guerrillas' top leader Prachanda and some other guerrillas ' leaders were present during the discussion.

The meeting came two days after a landmark peace deal between the ruling SPA and the guerrillas on the management of arms under the inspection of UN.

As per the agreement, the guerrillas' armed forces would be settled in seven cantonments around the country along with three tributary cantonments around each main cantonment and the guerrillas' weapons will be stored under "single lock" system with close inspection by UN teams while equal number of weapons of the Nepali Army will also be locked up.

According to the guerrillas, their armed forces are more than 35,000 and they have seven divisions.

Meanwhile, UN mission chief Martin told a press conference organized at the UN office in Kathmandu Thursday afternoon that his team would start trilateral negotiations from Friday to finalize the technicalities of management of arms and armies.

He said the government and the guerrillas should come up with a detailed agreement to make easier the process of arms management.
