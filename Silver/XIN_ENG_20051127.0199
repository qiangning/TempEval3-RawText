Chelsea face a Premier League probe after their former striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink claimed that players received unauthorized cash bonuses, BBC reported on Sunday.

Hasselbaink says Blues players received 100,000 pound for reaching the Champions League last four in 2003/04 rather than the 50,000 pound written into their deals.

Premier League rules state bonuses cannot be changed during a season, and Chelsea have denied any wrong-doing.

But the Premier League insists it is "duty bound" to investigate the claims.

Hasselbaink, now at Middlesbrough, said in his book: "At the beginning of the season he (Roman Abramovich) had promised us 50,000 per player if we reached the semi-finals of the competition.

"At the end of the month instead of the promised 50,000 there was 100,000 in our accounts."

A Premier League spokesman said: "We've received assurances from Chelsea that there is no case to answer regarding alleged extra payments to players. We have no reason to doubt these assurances.

"However, given recent comments by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink we are duty bound to investigate those comments and assess their factual basis."

Chelsea have once again moved to insists they are innocent, and a spokesman said: "Chelsea has already made it publicly clear on two occasions that is has not made any payments to players in breach of Football Association or Premiership regulations.

"The club stands by those statements totally.

"Moreover, two weeks ago, Chelsea invited the Premier League to look at any relevant documentation on this issue before any investigation was considered.

"The Premier League has not taken up that invitation. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has made false statements that potentially bring the game, and Chelsea, into disrepute. These should be investigated fully, not Chelsea."
