A Pakistani man was convicted Wednesday for providing financial support to a Sikh militant group in India and could face up to 45 years in prison.

The federal jury in New York returned the verdict on Khalid Awan following two weeks of trial, the US Department of Justice said in a statement.

Awan, who lives in New York, was accused of providing money and financial services to the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF), a Sikh militant group fighting for a separate state in the Punjab region of India.

The group is branded a terrorist organization by Washington.

Held on federal credit card fraud charges, Awan reportedly made telephone calls to Paramjit Singh Panjwar, the KCF leader and one of 10 "most wanted fugitives" in India, the statement said.

"Awan faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison," it said, ahead of the sentencing scheduled on March 7, 2007.

Among evidence presented in court were statements by Awan admitting that he sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to KCF.

"The war on terror is a global battle," said US attorney Mauskopf Mauskopf of the Eastern District of New York. "We will not permit individuals in our jurisdiction to finance terrorist groups responsible for murder and violence in any part of the world."
