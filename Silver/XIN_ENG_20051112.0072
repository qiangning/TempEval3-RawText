The much awaited 13th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) opened here Saturday with a vision to address major issues of the region, including poverty alleviation, environmental hazards, disaster prevention and terrorism.

The summit, postponed twice, was declared open at about 11:30 a. m.(05:30 GMT) in the Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Center by Shaukat Aziz, Prime Minister of Pakistan, the current chair country of SAARC.

After delivering a speech, Aziz handed over the chair of SAARC to Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.

In her speech, Zia stressed the need for mobilizing all necessary human and material resources of South Asian nations for poverty alleviation in the region and proposed declaring the coming 2006-2015 as "the SAARC Decade for Poverty Alleviation."

Zia said that in the last SAARC summit held in Islamabad in 2004, all member states recognized alleviation of poverty as the overarching goal of all SAARC activities. "We must mobilize all necessary human and material resources" to address the poverty on a regional scale, she said.

Widespread incidence of poverty continues to be a major concern for the South Asian nations. Intra-regional trade in South Asia still accounts for just 4 percent of the region's combined trade with the rest of the world. Foreign direct investment in the region accounts for a mere 1 percent of the global total.

Terming accelerating economic growth as major SAARC objective, the prime minister said all member states must ensure that the SAFTA (South Asia Free Trade Area) Agreement enters into force as agreed upon with effect from Jan. 1, 2006.

She also called for a common investment strategy to generate investment flows from within and outside the region.

Terming South Asia as an emerging economic giant with unlimited potential, the prime minister said, "Realizing South Asia's true potential is the challenge facing us today."

The prime minister said the ongoing 13th SAARC Summit enables the South Asian nations "to look to the future and forge a blueprint for the next phase of SAARC activities."

Leaders from Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka arrived in Dhaka on Friday to join the two-day summit to push the regional grouping into the third decade termed as the decade of implementation.

The summit is expected to give an outline of a "new vision" for addressing major issues and charting a road map for economic integration of South Asian nations to improve the lot of nearly 1. 5 billion people inhabiting the region.

SAARC was launched in 1985 with a pledge to ensure peace, strengthen the regional cooperation and adopt common strategies and programs to bring about a positive change into the lives of nearly 1.5 billion people in South Asia.

However, some analysts say that in the last 20 years, SAARC has failed to materialize its vision because of political and territorial disputes among some member countries.

With the improvement in the relationship between the two key players of the region, India and Pakistan, it is expected that from this summit SAARC would get a fresh momentum and ultimately become an effective regional grouping.

The Bangladeshi government has beefed up security to an unprecedented level by deploying over 30,000 security personnel and closing some artery roads ahead of the summit.
