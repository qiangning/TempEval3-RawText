A strong rally by the Philippine peso may be nearing its end after the US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates by another 25 basis points, Filipino central bank chief Amando Tetangco said Wednesday.

The US Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously Tuesday to raise the benchmark federal funds target rate by a quarter-percentage point to 4.25 percent, its highest level since May 2001.

"Its immediate implication for the Philippines is on interest rate differential and the possible downward effect on the domestic currency," Tetangco told reporters.

The peso, which traded at 53.695 to the dollar on Tuesday afternoon, has been hovering at two-and-a-half-year highs against the dollar in recent sessions, boosted by brisk remittances from the millions of Filipinos who work abroad.

Tetangco said the US Fed move was not likely to push Philippine consumer prices to rise sharply.

He said the US rate increase was expected but did not say whether the Philippine central bank will follow suit.

"The monetary board will make a full assessment that would include the inflation outlook, liquidity growth, external sector developments and other relevant factors when it meets tomorrow," Tetangco said.

The central bank has raised its overnight interest rates three times this year, by a total of 75 basis points to 7.50 percent for borrowing and 9.75 percent for lending.
