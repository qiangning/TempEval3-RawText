Heavy fighting resumed in central Somalia Wednesday after retreating Islamist fighters opened fire on a force of government and Ethiopian troops, officials and residents said, as the conflict in the Horn of Africa nation entered its second week.

Hours after the UN Security Council failed to agree on the withdrawal of foreign troops, Islamists fighters in trenches near the town of Jowhar opened fire to stop Somali-Ethiopian troops from advancing further southwards.

"Very heavy fighting has erupted outside Jowhar. The Islamic forces say they will keep fighting," said Mohamed Abdi Ali, a resident of the town about 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of the Islamist-controled capital of Mogadishu.

"Ethiopians have not started using planes yet, but we do not rule that out," he added.

"Our Islamist fighters are showing strength, they are in their defensive positions. God willing we will drive back the Ethiopian invaders," said Islamist commander Sheikh Takow.

Fighting first erupted December 20 after the Islamists, who controled most of the country, demanded the departure of Ethiopian troops supporting the UN-backed, but feeble government.

Somalia has been wracked by conflict since the 1991 ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.

The government Wednesday predicted Jowhar would fall as the allied Somali-Ethiopian forces consolidate their grip across the country's central and southern region with Islamic forces retreating.

"We expect to capture the town in the coming hours," said government spokesman Abdirahman Dinari.

Fleeing residents said rival sides deployed heavy artillery on the eighth day of duels that occurred 50 kilometres (31 miles) north of Jowhar.

"This fighting is very heavy, I have never heard such weapons used in Somalia, my wife and children are asking me to take them from the village because of the heavy artillery and mortar shells," said one resident, Hasan Doyow Nur.

The Islamists have retreated from their frontlines and accused Ethiopian forces of massacring civilians in the name of killing foreign fighters believed to be supporting the movement.

Witnesses said columns of Islamist forces had retreated to the heavily-fortified capital Mogadishu, where ruling clerics vowed to dig in for a long-lasting war with Ethiopian troops.

The Islamists said it was a "tactical retreat" that was forced by Addis Ababa's air assault on their positions.

The sustained clashes over the past week forced the UN World Food Programme to suspend its air operations and pull out its air-support staff.

"The WFP on Tuesday temporarily relocated two MI8 helicopters and 25 humanitarian workers from Kismayo to Nairobi," WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon told AFP Wednesday.

"The air operation had also become difficult because of an airspace ban into Somalia declared by the transitional federal government," he said.

"Therefore the helicopter operations and food airdrop from Antonov 12 into southern Somalia are currently suspended because of the airspace restriction," Smerdon said.

He emphasized the agency had suspended air but not land operations.

On Tuesday, Ethiopian Prime Meles Zenawi said his forces had killed more than 1,000 rival fighters, including Eritreans, forcing the Islamists to "full retreat", but added he was not aiming to take over Mogadishu.

In New York, the UN Security Council late Tuesday failed to agree on calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Somalia with key powers pressing for a ceasefire and a resumption of dialogue between warring Somali parties.

Washington, which accuses the Islamists of links to Al-Qaeda, put its weight behind Addis Ababa, but called on its regional anti-terrorism ally to exercise "maximum restraint."

Regional peacemaker Kenya, which helped form the Somali government in 2004, asked Ethiopia to cease military operations, as it announced plans to organise a regional meeting to discuss the escalation of the conflict in Somalia.
