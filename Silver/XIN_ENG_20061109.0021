A week after typhoon Cimaron lashed the Philippines, a new tropical depression is closing in northern Luzon, the state weather bureau said on Thursday.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said that as of 10 a.m., tropical depression "Queenie" was estimated at 1,040 kilometers east of northern Luzon, with maximum sustained winds of 55 kilometers per hour (kph) near the center.

PAGASA said Queenie was moving west at 19 kph and was expected to be 700 kilometers east southeast of northern Luzon by Friday morning; 330 kilometers east southeast of northern Luzon Saturday morning; and in the vicinity of Aparri, Cagayan by Sunday morning.

Cagayan province was among the hardest-hit areas when Cimaron lashed Luzon last week.

But PAGASA said Queenie is not likely to affect any part of the country within the next 24 hours.
