More than 30 people, including 16 policemen, were injured here Sunday when rioting broke out at a concert by the British rock group Def Leppard.

Police officials said that the violence was triggered when some 3,000 inebriated youths attacked security forces, some throwing stones and bottles, trying to get into the concert without paying.

Volunteer firefighters treated 17 concert-goers, three of them teenagers who were sent to hospital, while municipal aid teams tended to the 16 policemen, including the head of the city's emergency response unit.

"It was like an avalanche ... They were all crowded together. Some tried to force their way in and others behind began throwing stones," said national police chief Angel Comte.

Police issued a "red alert," fearing a replay of the rampage last October in which 79 people were crushed to death in the city's national stadium.

Mobilizing in large numbers around the square where the concert was held, police and emergency-response teams quashed the outbreaks of violence.

An hour before the five-man group was scheduled to appear, police decided the situation was under control and allowed the show to go on.
