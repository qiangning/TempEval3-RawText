Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ordered the army Wednesday to resume strikes on militants in Gaza after a rocket attack wounded two Israeli teenagers despite a month-long truce, his office said.

After meeting with his security officials, Olmert ordered the defense establishment "to act locally against Qassam rocket launching cells," said the statement, referring to the homemade rockets fired by Palestinian militants in Gaza.

"At the same time Israel will continue to respect the ceasefire and work with the Palestinian Authority in order ... for them... to take immediate steps to stop the Qassam fire," it said.

The statement seemed to indicate that Israel would not launch a ground operation in the Gaza Strip, but carry out air strikes against rocket launching cells, as called for by Defense Minister Amir Peretz.
