Former US secretary of state James Baker will meet the leader of Western Sahara's Polisario Front in Algeria on April 26, as part of a bid to resolve the dispute over the former Spanish colony, a Western Saharan source said here Friday.

Baker, 66, was named UN special envoy for Western Sahara in March and charged with relaunching the peace process there.

The meeting with Mohamed Abdelaziz in Tindouf, southwest Algeria, will be his first visit to the region since his nomination.

Baker will also visit refugee camps housing Western Saharan refugees, the source told AFP.

Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1976, prompting Morocco and Mauritania to claim sovereignty over the area while the nationalist Polisario Front, supported by Algeria, unleashed an independence war.

The United Nations has proposed a referendum on whether the territory should become part of Morocco or an independent state.

However the plebiscite has been repeatedly postponed since 1992, because the two sides cannot agree on criteria for determining who has the right to vote.
