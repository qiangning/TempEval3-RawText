England captain Marcus Trescothick won his third consecutive toss and put Pakistan into bat in the third day-night limited overs international at the National stadium here on Thursday.

The series is levelled at 1-1 after England won the first match by 42 runs, while Pakistan won the second by seven wickets -- both played in Lahore.

England lost batsman Kevin Pietersen two days before the match when back and rib cage problems forced him to return home.

His place was taken by Vikram Solanki, who was super-sub in Monday's second match.

Pakistan included allrounder Shahid Afridi in place of leg-spinner Danish Kaneria from their line-up of the first two matches.

Afridi served a ban of one Test and two one-day matches over damaging the pitch during the second Test at Faisalabad.
