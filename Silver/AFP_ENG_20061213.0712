Zimbabwe's veteran ruler Robert Mugabe may be handed two extra years in power this weekend during the annual meeting of his ruling party which is set to recommend he remain at the helm until 2010.

Mugabe, who has led his country since its 1980 independence from British colonial rule, completes his sixth term in 2008, when presidential elections are due.

But his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) supporters have held a series of meetings to set the agenda for the conference and agreed to pass a resolution to defer presidential elections to 2010.

"There is a feeling in the party that it would be a good thing to merge the parliamentary and presidential elections in order to save money," party spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira was quoted by the state-run Herald daily.

"It makes commonsense that we should do so, but the item is not on the agenda of the conference, but it could come up from the floor again or from the provinces."

Mugabe opens the conference on Friday in the obscure rural centre of Goromonzi although preparatory meetings were beginning on Thursday.

The ruling party's mouthpiece The Voice said in its latest edition that although simultaneous elections were "not on the agenda, it might end up being partly discussed if the provinces raise it in their reports."

Last year, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Patrick Chinamasa said the government was considering amending the constitution to merge parliamentary and presidential elections before Mugabe's current term expires.

He said ZANU-PF was considering bringing forward the end of the current parliamentary term from 2010 to 2008 to hold both presidential and parliamentary elections that year or stage the presidential elections in 2008 but allow the winner two years and hold presidential polls again two years later.

The third option was for the president to serve seven years from 2008 to 2015 and have concurrent elections from then onwards.

The newspaper said three-day congress, which will debate the theme of "consolidating our independence" will also discuss Zimbabwe's 1,000-percent-plus inflation rate and ravaged economy.

The meeting is also to take stock of the controversial seizure of white-owned farms for redistribution to landless blacks, which critics say has turned the former regional breadbasket into a food-hungry state.

The party conference last year was held against the backdrop of its sweep in elections to a new parliamentary Senate.

The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change split over a decision on whether to contest the polls to the newly created upper chamber.

Since then the MDC, which once posed the biggest threat to Mugabe's rule, has become a pale shadow of its former self with supporters divided between the two factions.

This year's party meeting comes as the country is reeling under chronic economic crises including four-digit inflation, crippling shortages of basic goods, food and fuel and skyrocketing unemployment.

The conference is also expected to discuss food security, new laws to give locals a majority stake in mining firms and calls for an extension of price controls among other measures to address the many economic woes.

Price controls were introduced by the government nearly four years ago to snuff out a burgeoning black market of basic commodities and a new law is under discussion for a new commission to be set up to monitor prices and salaries.

Zimbabwe's top union body has held several protests demanding a solution to the plight of workers bearing the brunt of the economic meltdown.
