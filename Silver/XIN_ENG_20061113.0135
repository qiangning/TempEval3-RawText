An eight-member delegation headed by Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan left for New Delhi on Monday to resume secretary-level dialogue with India after months of suspension.

India had suspended talks with Pakistan following the deadly train blasts in the Indian commercial center of Mumbai, which had killed more than 180 people and injured some 400.

India has alleged that Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e- Tayyeba had carried out the blasts with the help of Pakistan's intelligence agency.

Pakistan had denied the charges and said it would offer assistance in the investigation process and said that it would take action if India provided proofs.

The two-day talks to begin on Tuesday will formally mark the resumption of the stalled composite dialogue, considered an integral part of the ongoing Indo-Pakistan peace process.

President Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who met in the Cuban capital of Havana, had directed their foreign secretaries to resume dialogue.

Official sources said that the two sides would discuss mechanism on how to jointly deal with the issue of terrorism.

They will also review progress of talks held between senior officials of the two countries on varieties of key issues including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
