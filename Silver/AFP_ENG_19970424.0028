Taiwan-based personal computer giant Acer Inc. will begin producing GSM cellular telephones in eastern China's Suzhou next month, the China Daily reported Thursday.

The rollout by 30-million-dollar venture Acer Peripherals (Suzhou) Co. will mark the firm's first mainland production of GSM (global system for mobile communications) handsets, it said, quoting a company official.

Though it is already deeply involved in the Chinese PC market, Acer plans to strengthen its presence in the country's booming telecom market.

It is developing a new cellular phone using Chinese-developed technology, the report said.

Acer, the world's seventh largest computer maker, reported last month that its net profit slumped 44 percent from a year earlier to 3.06 billion Taiwan dollars (111.1 million US) in 1996.
