Ruling and opposition leaders, bureaucrats, government clerks, doctors, vets, businessmen and even housewives are named as conspirators in a 271-million-dollar fraud in India's Bihar state, the most crime-prone in the country.

"The system has collapsed. Nothing works," commented Uttam Sengupta, editor of The Times of India's regional edition in Bihar, India's second most populous state where some 12 million educated youths are jobless.

Sengupta and others do not blame Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav for the virtual anarchy in the state.

"Lawlessness is partly because the system has collapsed. All political parties patronise criminals and the police does not function."

Yadav, two of his cabinet colleagues and a federal minister from Bihar, are among 56 others charged in the swindle, which federal investigators now say has been going on openly since 1977.

Despite the spiralling lawlessness, economic chaos and rampant unemployment, Yadav was re-elected chief minister for a second time in 1995.

But now, Yadav faces mounting demands for his removal in connection with the scandal which people in Bihar say is a symbol of the state's malaise.

Bihar, with a population of 90 million, witnessed 5,193 murders last year, up by 157 reported homicides over the previous year while 5,039 people were killed in non-political violence during 1994.

The state's 75,000-member police department deployed across 55 districts reported 2,603 robberies last year and 2,472 the previous. It also saw some 12,490 armed clashes during 1996 and 12,000 a year before.

Maoist guerrillas killed 60 people last year while 73 others lost their lives and 88 were robbed on trains running across Bihar.

On Tuesday, fed up with rampant crime, some 5,000 Bihari students smashed through police barriers in the Indian capital to protest the daylight murder earlier this month of a prominent university leader in the state, allegedly by a politician from Yadav's party.

Massive power breakdowns, annual droughts and floods have stunted industrial growth in Bihar, which accounts for a third of India's mineral deposits. It also has two of the country's biggest steel plants and is one of largest producer of fertiliser.

The Times editor Sengupta describes the situation in Bihar, where per capita income is one of the lowest in India, as "paradoxical."

"The situation is complex here," he said.

Bihar is India's second largest grower of vegetables, third largest exporter of fruits and accounts for a large number of professionals settled in Europe and the United states.

"The situation appears bad because the population is so large and its density is very high.
