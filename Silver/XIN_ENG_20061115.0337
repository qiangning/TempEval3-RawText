Bulgaria is negotiating with the Russian natural gas monopoly Gazprom for a long-term agreement on gas supply and transit, the country's Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov told the parliament's Energy Committee on Wednesday, reported BTA.

He stressed that Sofia seeks strategic partnership with Gazprom in order to ensure sufficient amounts of natural gas for Bulgaria. If the effective agreements, which will expire in 2010, are not renegotiated, gas prices will increase at least 40 percent after that year and gas transit via Bulgaria will be reduced, he said.

He refuted media predictions about a remarkable price raise of Russian natural gas at the beginning of 2007.

Ovcharov noted that his country does not have many opportunities to diversify its gas supply sources.

At the end of the month, the minister will report to the leadership of Bulgaria's ruling coalition on the outcome of the talks. A decision will then be made whether to sign new long-term agreements or to go by the current agreements.

Under the contract for gas supply from Russia to Bulgaria signed in 1998, the Balkan country pays some 257 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cube meters of gas and receives 83 dollars for transit. Though the agreement has a term until 2010, the two countries are expected to start talks to review the terms of supply.

More than 97 percent of gas consumed in Bulgaria comes from Russia.
