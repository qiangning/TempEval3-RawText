China's central bank has removed the country's former statistics chief Qiu Xiaohua from its monetary policy consulting body, said the General Office of the State Council, or China's cabinet, on Wednesday.

Qiu Xiaohua was dismissed from the top job at the National Bureau of Statistics on Oct. 12 for his suspected involvement in the 10 billion-yuan (1.25 billion U.S. dollars) Shanghai social security fund fraud.

Xie Fuzhan, the newly appointed NBS head, has replaced Qiu as one of the 13 commissioners on the Monetary Policy Committee of the People's Bank of China, said the Office.

Xie had been deputy director of the Development Research Center of the State Council before taking up the NBS post.
