British troops held their final field exercise in Hong Kong on Tuesday as an advance party of China's army settled in at the barracks here as the handover of sovereignty nears.

Soldiers of the elite Scottish regiment the Black Watch set up positions on the banks of streams, in bushes and in the hillsides, firing blanks from SA-80 assault rifles to repulse an imaginary invasion from eastern Hong Kong.

The day before, 40 unarmed Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers drove into the British army headquarters to prepare for the changing of the guard on midnight June 30 after 156 years of British rule.

The PLA's arrival revived memories here of the 1989 crackdown on the mainland pro-democracy movement, but the Black Watch's commanding officer voiced confidence in the incoming Chinese troops.

"The PLA, when they move in here, know it's a window on the world and they've been training very hard and very seriously for it and I think they are going to have very good troops here," said Lieutenant-Colonel Alasdair Loudon, leading the exercise in the forest land of the New Territories.

"I don't think people in Hong Kong have anything to fear from the sort of people and the command element that is coming here," he told AFP.

"They know how important it is, a mirror on the world. They know that the profile they set here in Hong Kong is going to be highly visible and how China and the army are judged in general."

"They are very pragmatic. I think it's going to be fine," Loudon said.

The Chinese troops are obviously well drilled.

"They've been walking around in single file, and in their buses on the way in yesterday they were all sitting at attention," said one British army official.

The advanced party's arrival Monday was the most tangible sign yet of the change of sovereignty on July 1.

The British troops on display Tuesday admitted they would miss Hong Kong, one of the choice postings in the shrinking foreign circuit of the British Army.

"It's a historical event and a great honour to be the last ones here. But it's very sad as well," said Captain James Houghton, daubed in camouflage paint.

"I'll miss it greatly," said Corporal John Lyon, 28.

The consensus was that the Chinese troops, housed alongside their British counterparts at the Prince of Wales Barracks and on the former British naval base at Stonecutters Island, would keep a lower profile.

"We'll find out how good they are on whisky, but we don't expect to see them up Lan Kwai Fong," one captain said, referring to the raucous club and bar area in central Hong Kong.

The troops will be paid a pittance compared to the British, with the commanding officer on a reported salary of just over 1,000 Hong Kong dollars (130 US), little more than a quarter of the monthly earnings of local maids.

"I don't think that they are going to mix in with the civilian community as the British Army has done," Loudon said.

"I suspect that they will be much more low-profile and probably not meet as many people, but I would expect them to be efficient, high quality troops."

"They are going to be very self-contained, they are going to be sharing the recreational facilities and any help that we can give in terms of letting them use our facilities, talking to them, answering questions we'll do."

"It's in everybody's interests to have that kind of relationship."
