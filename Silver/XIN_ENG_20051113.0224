English premier league club Tottenham have dismissed reports saying captain Ledley King had rejected a fresh deal, insisting that they have yet to offer him a new contract.

The 25-year-old's current contract runs until 2008 and Spurs sporting director Damien Comolli said: "We initiated talks with Ledley and his advisors.

"Our discussions are in the early stages and will continue in private.

"It is totally inaccurate to say that he has rejected any offer, we haven't made one."

King plays in central defence for Spurs but was employed in a holding midfield role for England against Argentina on Saturday.

He had the task of man-marking playmaker Juan Riquelme and revealed the game proved a steep learning curve.

"It was difficult for me," he said. "They have got players who like to drop into the hole and at times I found it hard.

"Riquelme is a top-class player and there were times he drifted out wide, dragged me out - and left spaces for other players to move into.

"It is a learning process. I don't play there often so every game is a learning curve and it is a good lesson being up against some of the best."
