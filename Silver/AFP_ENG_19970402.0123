President Le Duc Anh opened Vietnam's National Assembly Wednesday with an attack on individualism, calling it a danger which strikes at the heart of communism and threatens development and national security.

"We must not allow selfish individualism to run counter to the interests of the state," the 76-year-old president said in a speech at the opening day of the National Assembly, appearing for the first time in public since suffering a stroke in November.

"Individualism is tending to develop in various forms in state enterprises and offices, causing huge damage to solidarity, state property and is a hurdle to national development," he said.

"Individualism reduces people's confidence in the Party and state, discourages some foreign investors," said Anh, a conservative who observers expect will be replaced in September.

He quoted Ho Chi Minh, the founder of modern Vietnam who remains the symbol of ideological purity, as saying, "Individualism is a wicked enemy to socialism. Revolutionary people must annihilate it."

The remarks were echoed by Le Kha Phieu, who as head of the Interior Ministry is responsible for internal security. He linked individualism to corruption, drugs and even weaknesses in the banking system, which has been rocked by scandal and mishap this year.

"Banks lend people money but they use the money on gambling and on spending on parties, that is individualism," he told reporters.

Although two key pieces of banking legislation have been postponed until the next National Assembly session in the fall, observers said the performance of the central bank, and especially its governor Cao Si Kiem, will come under heavy criticism.

"Kiem is going to take a lot of heat for the problems in the banking system, and it looks quite likely that he will go," said one Hanoi- based businessman.

The session will also make amendments in the penal code, introducing stiffer penalties for corruption and drug trafficking, production and abuse.

"We are sick of talking about corruption, now is the time to take action," Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet told reporters.

Earlier this week, a Ho Chi Minh City appeals court upheld the death penalty for four people convicted of embezzling nearly 40 million dollars in state funds.

The assembly is expected to also pass laws introducing a value added tax to replace the existing turnover tax, a law on corporate income tax and a trade law.

It will pass a law on the election of representives that will enlarge the National Assembly from 395 to 450 members when elections for the next five-year term are held on July 20. It will also include provisions allowing candidates to conduct their campaigns in the media.

Communist party representation, which now makes up 92 percent of delegates, could fall to about 80 percent, said Vu Mao, the National Assembly office chairman. Up to seven of 10 present deputies will be replaced, he said last week.
