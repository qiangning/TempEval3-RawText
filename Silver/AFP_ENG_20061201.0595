European plane maker Airbus is to develop its A350 passenger jet, parent company EADS announced on Friday, ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the European aerospace industry.

The board of EADS met in Amsterdam to discuss the A350 programme and decided to "give the go ahead" for the commercial development of the aircraft, a statement from EADS said.

"The A350 XWB, together with the A330/A340 aircraft family, will meet a market that requires some 5,700 new aircraft being delivered in the next two decades, with more than 1,000 billion dollars in value," the statement said.

The twin-engine Airbus A350 XWB has been designed to compete with two Boeing airliners, the existing 777 and the future 787 Dreamliner, which has proved highly popular with airlines.

Initially drawn up in 2005, the Airbus A350 design was sent back to the drawing board after prospective clients complained of insufficient passenger capacity and excessive fuel consumption. It re-emerged in July this year as the A350 XWB. XWB stands for extra wide body.

Financing of the project is considered by analysts to be a critical issue and, tellingly, Airbus was vague about the details of how the 10-billion-euro (13-billion-dollar) project will be paid for.

EADS and Airbus, which is a 100-percent-owned unit of EADS, are financially stretched because of cost over-runs with the Airbus A380 superjumbo project, which is running two years behind schedule.

As a result, EADS stressed on Friday that the decision on the A350 was linked to the "full implementation" of a vast restructuring plan called Power 8, which aims to cut costs throughout the business.

It said the A350 would be financed "predominantly from the company cash flows".

Nevertheless, EADS and Airbus are still expected to need other sources of capital to finance the project, the costs of which are forecast to be about double the initial estimate.

Other sources could be the capital markets, in the form of a share issue or a bond issue, but might also be from European governments, namely Britain, France, Germany or Spain.

The involvement of governments, which are able to grant low-interest loans or guarantees, is a prickly issue given the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and the European Union.

The United States has filed a complaint at the World Trade Organisation alleging the government loans to Airbus amount to illegal state aid.

The European Union has countered with its own case, alleging that Boeing also benefits from illegal state aid, particularly in the form of uncontested military contracts.

"The funding requirements going forward will be proactively managed in line with company policy to preserve a strong balance sheet," EADS said.

"EADS expects to spread the development costs of the full XWB family over the years 2007 to 2014, with the bulk of the spending occurring in 2010-2013."
