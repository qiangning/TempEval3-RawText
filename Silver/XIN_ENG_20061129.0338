A Manila-bound jet carrying more than 280 passengers made an emergency landing at Vancouver International Airport shortly after take-off Wednesday morning.

Airport officials told media the Philippines airliner had just left the airport when a problem developed with one of its wing flaps.

The pilot decided to turn back and dumped fuel into the ocean on the way to Vancouver.

Fire and ambulance crews were dispatched as a precaution but the aircraft landed without incident.

It is unclear when the flight will resume.
