A British military probe has found insufficient proof to back charges that British troops raped hundreds of Kenyan women while on training missions in Kenya going back decades, officials said Thursday.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) published the findings of the military police inquiry after a team of up to 20 officers investigated more than 2,000 claims of rape over a 55-year period.

"In terms of a criminal investigation, there is no corroborative evidence that would lead to the successful prosecution of a named individual in a UK (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) court," the MoD said.

The ministry released the findings by the Royal Military Police's (RMP) Special Investigations Branch (SIB) following what it said was an external review by Devon and Cornwall Police, a civilian force in southwest England.

The army's main personnel officer Lieutenant General Freddie Viggers said the findings were properly vetted.

"The British Army has taken these allegations extremely seriously and they have been extensively and sensitively examined," Viggers said in the MoD statement.

"It has been a complex and detailed investigation which has been subject to rigorous internal and external reviews and all viable lines of inquiry have been pursued," he said.

The Times's newspaper said the RMP's investigation involved a team of between 12 and 18 investigators interviewing all 2,187 claimants, most of them Masai and Samburu tribeswomen from some of the remotest areas of the country.

They had demanded 20 million pounds (30 million euros, 39 million dollars) in compensation from the British Army for the the alleged rapes.

The newspaper said the investigators deemed just 281 of the total set of allegations worthy of closer inspection, all of which fell apart during follow-up interviews with local people and former members of the British Army and upon further scrutiny.

Though several women with mixed-race babies staged demonstrations outside the British High Commission when the allegations surfaced in 2003, The Times said that it now appears that the children resulted either from consensual sex or rapes by other men.

One woman told the newspaper that she only took part in the protest because she had been told that there was a chance of large payouts.

The MoD said that each claim was carefully examined by the SIB, working with Home Office specialists and the Kenyan authorities.

It was reported that the team uncovered large numbers of forged entries in the Kenyan police files about the alleged rapes -- some of them described as "astonishingly clumsy".

"A large amount of the information provided by the Kenyan police and medical authorities appears to have been fabricated," an MoD spokeswoman said.

Since Kenya gained independence in 1963, the British Army has maintained a permanent garrison there, known as the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK), with up to 4,000 British troops training there annually.
