The National Exhibition on Russia was held in Beijing on Friday to show Russia's progress in high-tech industry, aviation, forestry and other fields.

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov attended the opening ceremony.

Wen said the exhibition enabled the Chinese people to learn about Russia's economic development, scientific advances and cultural progress.

He said the exhibition reflected the aspirations of both China and Russia to further economic and trade cooperation, saying that he hoped more areas could be explored to facilitate cooperation between the two countries.

Wen vowed to hold a successful exhibition on China in Russia in 2007.

Fradkov said the exhibition was the largest one held by Russia in China, which showed the great potential for Russia-China cooperation and would promote mutual understanding between the two peoples.
