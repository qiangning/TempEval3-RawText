The U.S. trade deficit declined by 6.8 percent to 64.3 billion U.S. dollars in September, a Commerce Department report said on Thursday.

The drop of 4.7 billion dollars in September, down from a revised record estimate of 69 billion dollars in August, was the biggest one-month decline since February 2001.

The report said the sharp drop was due to the fact that oil import prices fell for the first time in five months and U.S. exports edged higher to a new record.

In September, the goods and services deficit was down 0.7 billion dollars from September 2005. Exports were up 16.8 billion, or 15.8 percent, to a record estimate of 123.2 billion dollars.

Meanwhile, U.S. imports in September were up 16.2 billion dollars, or 9.4 percent, to 187.5 billion dollars.
