Two U.S. helicopters opened fire on a funeral in Sadr City in eastern Baghdad on Friday, wounding two people, an Interior Ministry official told Xinhua.

Residents in Sadr City attended a funeral for victims who were killed in Thursday's deadliest bombings and some people fired into the air when two U.S. Apache helicopters flow over, the official said on condition of anonymity.

The choppers fired into the crowd, wounding two people, the official said, adding it seemed to be an accident, not clash.

Earlier in the day, Doha-based al-Jazeera English channel reported that armed clashes erupted on Friday evening between U.S. forces and Shiite militiamen in Shiite stronghold of Sadr City in eastern Baghdad.

On Thursday afternoon, at least 200 people were killed and more than 250 others were injured in four coordinated bombings in Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City.

It was the deadliest bombing attacks since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.
