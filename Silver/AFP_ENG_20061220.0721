China's national social security fund will oversee nine provincial governments' pension programs in a move aimed at centralising control of retirement plans and stopping corruption, state press reported Thursday.

The China Daily said the new arrangement follows supplements worth 10 billion yuan (1.3 billion dollars) doled out from central government coffers to supplement the provinces' own pension holdings.

The National Council for the Social Securities Fund, which will oversee the program, has promised a minimum of 3.5 percent annual investment return and said it would also shoulder any losses in the five-year arrangement.

The management overhaul is a response to the far-reaching graft scandal that involved city officials in the misuse of Shanghai's 1.25 billion dollar pension fund, with money there being spent on speculative property and highway projects.

The financial scandal, which first emerged in July, ensnared scores of senior Shanghai officials and felled the city's top politician, Chen Liangyu.

It is believed the new system will help ensure transparency in the management and supervision of social security funds.

"The move is aimed at ensuring the pension fund (is) invested and managed more efficiently and safely," the report quoted Xiang Huaicheng, chairman of the council and a former finance minister as saying.

China's National Audit Office said in a report in November that by the end of 2005 a total of 7.1 billion yuan of pension funds had gone missing.

The National Council for Social Securities Fund currently manages roughly 220 billion yuan of China's pensions.

The country also has about 100 billion yuan in local pension funds, mostly corporate annuities, that have been contributed to by companies as employee retirement benefits apart from basic social security.

Provincial and municipal governments currently decide how those pensions are invested and usually do not employ professional asset managers or custodians.

As a result, a substantial portion of the money is held in investments such as real estate projects and long-term loans without public accountability and subject to low liquidity and high risk.
