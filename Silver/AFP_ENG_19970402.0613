A crew member of the US aircraft carrier Independence had to be airlifted to a Sydney hospital after he was hit by a fighter plane attempting a night landing on the ship.

The incident late Wednesday left the man with fractured legs and arms, an ambulance spokesman here said.

"He sustained fractured legs and arms and was airlifted to Sydney airport by an Independence helicopter," the spokesman said.

The spokesman said few details were available but he understood an FA-18 Hornet aircraft approaching the Independence's landing deck overshot the runway and hit the man.

The aircraft carrier left Sydney Harbour Tuesday after a six-day rest and recreation visit.

It was in Australia to participate in Operation Tandem Thrust, a joint Australian/US military exercise involving 28,000 troops in far north Queensland state which ended last week.

After hitting the man the damaged aircraft was forced to fly 120 nautical miles on one engine, escorted by another FA-18 and a Viking tanker plane, to make an emergency landing at the Williamtown RAAF Base near Newcastle, about 150 kilometres (93 miles) north of Sydney, an official there said.

Wing Commander Lou Lapuma said the Hornet's undercarriage collapsed as it made an emergency landing but the pilot was unhurt.

"He was off the coast relatively near an F-18 base when he lost his engine and undercarriege; we were also preparing for night manoeuvres, so all the emergency crews were here (in Williamtown) anyway.

"We're in contact with the Independence and trying to figure out what they want to do with their plane and their pilot," Lapuma said.

The Independence, commissioned in 1959, is the US Navy's oldest active ship.

It served in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the liberation of Grenada in 1983, the Gulf War in 1990 and last year's tensions between Taiwan and China.

More than 5,000 sailors and marines live aboard.
