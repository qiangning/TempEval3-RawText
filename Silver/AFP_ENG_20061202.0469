The United States said Saturday that the Cuban regime must take steps toward democracy before Washington would consider any "deepening" of bilateral relations, responding to Raul Castro's invitation to come to the negotiating table.

"The dialogue that needs to take place is one between the Cuban regime and the Cuban people about the democratic future of the island," Janelle Hironimus, a State Department spokeswoman, told AFP.

"As we have consistently stated, any deepening of our engagement with Cuba depends on that dialogue and the Cuban regime's willingness to take concrete steps toward a political opening and a transition to democracy," she said.

Raul Castro, Cuba's defense minister and interim leader since his ailing brother Fidel underwent surgery in July, said in a speech to troops earlier Saturday: "Let me take this opportunity to express our willingness to settle the long US-Cuba disagreement at the negotiating table."

"Of course, that is, as long as they accept that we are a country that does not tolerate any reduction of its independence, and based on the principles of equality, reciprocity, non-interference and mutual respect," he told Communist Party and military leaders at Cuba's first military parade in a decade.

"Until that happens, after almost half a century, we are prepared to wait patiently for the moment when common sense takes root in the halls of power in Washington," he said.

The parade marked the 50th anniversary of the armed forces and capped belated 80th birthday celebrations for Fidel Castro, Cuba's leader since 1959.

The speech by Raul Castro, coming in the vacuum of Fidel Castro's public disappearance since his intestinal surgery in July, seemed to confirm a desire to ease the traditionally strained tensions with Washington.

The policy of willingness to talk with the United States if respected as an equal is standing Cuban policy.

But Raul Castro's timing and mention of the negotiating table -- as Cuba is consolidating its changing of the communist guard -- suggests some growing autonomy on his part.

A few weeks after taking the reins of government from his brother on July 31, Raul Castro hinted at some openness to dialogue with the United States in an interview with the Communist Party newspaper Granma, suggesting ties might be normalized on equal terms.

But the US had shot back that it was not talking to "Fidel light."

Since Fidel Castro's illness removed him from the scene, the United States has made numerous appeals for Cuba to open up to democracy.

Cuba, Latin America's only one-party communist regime, and the United States do not have full diplomatic relations. Each maintains an Interests Section, a diplomatic office, in the other's capital.

The United States has maintained a trade embargo against Cuba since 1962.
