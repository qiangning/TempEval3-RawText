A record 238 people have signed up to contest next month's presidential election in Iran, but only a small number are expected to be approved, the interior ministry announced on Tuesday.

The ministry said it forwarded the list of hopefuls -- including several women -- to the 12-member Council of the Guardians, which will vet them to ensure they meet legal and ideological requirements.

Once a list of eligible candidates is released, they can launch a 12-day campaign for the May 23 polls, Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said. Campaigning will have to stop 24 hours before the election.

The names of the hopefuls have not been published, but, according to newspapers, nine women have signed up for the first time in a presidential election since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

The Iranian constitution is vague on whether or not women can run for president, and it is up to the council to decide based on its interpretation of the law.

The council, composed of six senior clergymen and six jurists, has a duty to ensure laws and their implementation conform to the constitution and Islamic regulations.

However, the overwhelming majority of the hopefuls are expected to be rejected, as the constitution states the president should be a political and religious authority.

The two main candidates are parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nategh- Nuri, who is backed by the ruling clergy, and former culture minister Mohammad Khatami, supported by Islamic moderates and leftwingers. Both are clerics.

It will be the seventh presidential election in Iran since the revolution. President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has served two four- year terms and is not allowed to run again.
