Israeli troops on Thursday demolished a second home in the Palestinian village of Surif on the West Bank where a curfew is in force in connection with last month's Tel Aviv suicide bombing, the army said.

A first home was destroyed on Wednesday night belonging to Ibrahim Ghanimat, a member of a cell of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) accused of causing the deaths of 11 Israelis in a series of attacks.

The demolition sparked clashes with troops during which two villagers were shot and wounded as protesters took to the streets in violation of the curfew, hospital sources said.

The army sent in the bulldozers again on Thursday to tear down the home of Abdel Rahman Ghanimat, who like his namesake has been linked to the Islamic suicide bomber who killed three Israeli women in Tel Aviv on March 21.

The curfew on Surif, a town of 15,000 inhabitants, was imposed after the army discovered the body of a kidnapped Israeli soldier, Sergeant Sharon Edry, in the village last Thursday.

The HAMAS radicals were arrested on suspicion of involvement in Edry's murder and the 10 other deaths.
