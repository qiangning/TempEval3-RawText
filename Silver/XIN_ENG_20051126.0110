China will adopt encouraging policies to promote the development, research and consumption of energy efficient and environment-friendly vehicles, said Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan, of the State Council, here Friday.

"China highly stresses the development of such vehicles," said Zeng when visiting an ongoing exhibition of international clear auto technologies in Beijing.

China must make adequate efforts to develop such vehicles given that China is currently in the process of build a society which hails energy saving and environment friendly practices, he said.

China encourages its auto industry to carry out international cooperation and introduce advanced technologies from other countries and regions, said Zeng, who looked quite happy when model operations of China's self-developed electricity-powered and mix-powered auto is already under way.

"The government supports Chinese enterprises to increase investment to develop core and critical technologies, foster home-grown brand names and enhance independent innovation capabilities," he said.

Thanks to the rapid growth of its auto industry in recent years, China has become the third largest auto sale country and fourth auto producer of the world.

To date, Chinese auto makers have developed more than 100 types of gas-fuelled vehicles, which has been promoted in 19 Chinese cities and prefectures.
