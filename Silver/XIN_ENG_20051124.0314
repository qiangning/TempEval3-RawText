New Zealand's imports of merchandise goods for October 2005 increased 316 million NZ dollars (221 million US dollars), up 10.4 percent compared with October 2004, and are provisionally valued at 3,341 million NZ dollars (2339 million US dollars), Statistics New Zealand said Friday.

It said driving the increase were higher values for aircraft and parts, valued at 330 million NZ dollars (232 million US dollars). This value is due primarily to the import of two aircraft.

Exports of merchandise goods for October 2005 are provisionally valued at 2,459 million NZ dollars (1721 million US dollars), which is 30 million NA dollars (21 million US dollars) lower than for October 2004. The main contributors to the reduced exports value were wood and wood articles; aircraft; and ships and boats. Partly offsetting these was a higher value for meat.

The trade balance for the October 2005 month is a deficit of 882 million (617 million US dollars), or 35.9 percent of exports. The size of the deficit has decreased for two consecutive months.

The average trade balance for an October month for the past 10 years is a deficit of 462 million NZ dollars (323 million US dollars), 20.2 percent of exports, said the Statistics New Zealand.

Exports to China in October 2005 valued 140 million NZ dollars (98 million US dollars), and are provisionally valued at 1,559 million NZ dollars (1091 million US dollars), and imports from China valued in October 2005 at 388 million NZ dollars (271 million US dollars), and are provisionally valued at 3,945 million NZ dollars (2761 million US dollars), up 21.9 percent compared with last year, thus put China the number two country of New Zealand imports from the third last year, said Statistics New Zealand.
