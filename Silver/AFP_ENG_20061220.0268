Swiss authorities have confiscated more than 3.3 million Swiss francs (2.7 million dollars, 2.0 million euros) held in a local bank by cocaine traffickers who ferried Colombian drugs to the United States, a magistrate said Wednesday.

The funds were seized from the accounts at a bank in the western city of Lausanne during a probe that was launched in 1994 on a request from US authorities, regional investigating magistrate Jacques Antenen said in a statement.

A first deposit of 1.7 million Swiss francs belonging to an American pilot who organised flights carrying Colombian cocaine from Belize to the US state of Alabama was seized in September 2000.

Another 400,000 Swiss francs from the trafficking ring's radio operator was confiscated later. The operation was completed with the seizure of 1.2 million Swiss francs on December 6 from a Cuban-American who organised money laundering for the network.

All three accused, who were not named, were prosecuted and sentenced in the United States, Antenen said.

No charges were retained against the bank, he added.
