Elderly men with early prostate cancer live significantly longer if they receive treatment than those who adopt a wait-and-see approach, as commonly recommended, according to a new study released Wednesday.

The study of 44,630 men age 65 to 80 years found that those who sought treatment for their prostate cancer with radiation or surgery had a 31 percent lower risk of death than those who waited.

Even the oldest men between the ages of 75 and 80 benefitted from treatment, the study found.

"Even though prostate cancer commonly is considered an indolent (slow to develop and painless) disease, this observational study suggests a reduced risk of mortality associated with active treatment for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer in the elderly (...) population examined," the authors of the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association said.

Dr Yu-Ning Wong of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philidelphia, who led the study, told AFP that the findings challenge the commonly held notion that early prostate cancer in elderly patients evolves so slowly that there is no need to treat them as they will probably die of something else first.

"The treatment of prostate cancer in older men (...) has been controversial because the concern about side effects is an important one," Wong said. "I think our study suggests there may be a benefit to treatment in this patient population but that of course needs to be weighed against other concerns."

Wong also acknowledged that the study's design had limitations and would need to be confirmed by further research.

Postate cancer is the most common cancer found in American men, along with skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).

ACS estimates that 234,460 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 and some 27,350 will die of the disease.
