Political tension gripped the Palestinian territories Sunday after president Mahmud Abbas called for early elections, dramatically raising the stakes in a long-running power struggle with the ruling Hamas party.

The move set off fears that the standoff between Hamas -- the Islamist movement that swept parliamentary elections at the start of this year -- and the president's own Fatah faction could ignite into full-blown civil war.

A member of the presidential guard was killed and several people injured in what a security official described as an attempt Sunday by Hamas members to storm a presidential guard training camp.

A Palestinian boy was shot dead and at least 18 others wounded late Saturday as thousands of armed loyalists of the two rivals, some of them masked, took to the streets of Gaza after Hamas denounced Abbas's move as tantamount to a coup.

"We are going to organize many demonstrations to prove to the president that we have the majority and that his call for elections is unacceptable," senior Hamas official Ahmed Yussef told AFP.

Abbas said elections were the way to resolve the seething tensions with Hamas, which have paralyzed the Palestinian administration and added to the woes of a people suffering from a Western aid freeze.

"We are living through difficult and miserable times," he said.

"To break the vicious circle and prevent our lives from deteriorating further and our cause from eroding, I have decided to call early presidential and legislative elections. Let the people have their say and decide."

No date was set, but a senior aide to Abbas said the polls would take place "between now and three months".

British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who touched down Saturday in Cairo as part of a Middle East tour, welcomed Abbas's call and urged the international community to rally behind the president.

The United States said it hoped that elections would help quell violence, while Israel -- which views Hamas as a terrorist organisation that refuses to recognize the Jewish state -- said it supported the moderate president.

Abbas left the door open to forming a government of national unity, composed of technocrats, thus avoiding what would be the third election in the Palestinian territories since the Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994.

Hamas responded angrily, saying that Abbas's move represented "a coup d'etat against the will of the Palestinian people".

"Today what we have heard from Abu Mazen is a call, which if God willing we will try to avoid, for a civil war," Yussef said earlier Saturday.

Complicating the crisis is the fact that Palestinian basic law does not address the issue of early elections. The current parliament, elected in January, normally would remain in place until the end of 2010.

Abbas's declaration followed a week of rising tensions and violence between his Fatah party and Hamas, and followed the collapse of months of tortuous talks on forming a national unity government.

On Friday, Hamas accused Fatah loyalists of targeting Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya after his convoy came under fire in southern Gaza, killing his bodyguard and injuring one of his sons.

A Palestinian security official told AFP that Hamas members tried to storm Sunday morning a training camp in southern Gaza for the presidential guard, triggering an intense exchange of automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenade fire in which one camp guard was killed.

Hamas officials were not immediately available for comment.

The Fatah-Hamas talks failed over the Islamists' refusal to bend to Western demands that it renounce violence, recognize Israel and accept past peace deals, and over allocation of key ministerial posts.

Like Israel, the West considers Hamas a terrorist organization. It froze direct aid to the Palestinian government after the Islamists took office, plunging the territories into unprecedented financial crisis.
