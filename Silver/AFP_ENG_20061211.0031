Four members of Bangladesh's interim cabinet have quit in protest at the president's decision to deploy the army to restore order ahead of January's elections, an interim cabinet member said.

"We have sent our resignation letter to the president, because we think that no situation has been created in the country that warranted an army deployment," interim cabinet member Sultana Kamal said.

President Iajuddin Ahmed ordered the deployment late on Saturday to help the civil administration restore order after the country's opposition parties threatened non-stop protests to force electoral reforms.
