Former Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo has fled the country and the government is thinking of charging him with treason, government spokesman Kin Kiey Mulumba told reporters Tuesday.

The spokesman said that Zaire's war chest funds were empty and that the government believed Kengo was responsible.

Officials were thinking of issuing an international arrest warrant against Kengo, he said, commenting: "We would like to get that money back."
