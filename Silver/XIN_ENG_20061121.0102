Turkeys lovers in Zambia will miss out on their favorite meat this festive season because Zambia's ban stays, The Post reported on Tuesday.

The Department of Veterinary and Livestock Development decided in March this year to ban the importation and movement of live birds and poultry products following reports of avian influenza in Nigeria and the possibility of the disease spreading to other African countries.

Poultry Association of Zambia executive director Mathew Ngosa said the ban on the importation of poultry products still stands.

Ngosa was quoted as saying that Zambia is not able to contain the potential outbreak of bird flue and so it needs to be protective.

"We are not likely to have new stocks for the festive season until management resolves some important issues with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives," a supermarket attendant said.

The Shoprite attendant said usually it imports several tons of turkey and other birds from South Africa and Brazil for special occasions such as Christmas and the festive season.
