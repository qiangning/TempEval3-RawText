Former England star Paul Gascoigne has been arrested after allegedly assaulting a photographer outside a Liverpool hotel.

The incident happened hours after Gazza was sacked as manager of Nationwide Conference North side Kettering Town after just 39 days in charge, with team bosses complaining about his drinking.

Gazza was to be questioned by police later Tuesday in connection with an incident at the Hope Street Hotel in Liverpool.

A Merseyside Police spokesman said: "A 38-year-old man was arrested following reports of an alleged assault outside the Hope Street Hotel at around 11.30pm last night.

"He is currently in custody at a police station in the city and will be interviewed by detectives later today."

Gascoigne, 38, had visited the city to speak at a fund-raiser for a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre.

The Sun newspaper reported that freelance photographer Steve Farrell, nursing a cut eye, complained to police that he had been assaulted as he was on the street outside the hotel alongside other snappers.

Earlier Monday, Kettering Town chairman Imraan Ladak had decided to remove Gascoigne as manager.

Ladak said he spoke to Gascoigne after 37 separate incidents since he became manager.

He said Gascoigne was "under the influence of alcohol before, during and after several first-team games and training sessions".

The one-time Newcastle, Spurs, Lazio and Rangers midfielder admitted drinking a double brandy before one game, but insisted he had been "stitched up".

Confronted with claims that he had been under the influence of drink at a recent match, Gascoigne told Sky Sports News: "So what? I tell you the truth, I had a double brandy before the game.

"Before it used to be four bottles of whisky. It's not any more."

He added: "As far as I'm concerned I'm not sacked because I never signed a contract."

He was also dismissive of Ladak's knowledge of the game, describing him as "a doctor" who was a "control freak".

"He told me he's been watching football for 20 years, five days a week, and knows how football should be played," he said.

"Well, the guy can't trap a bag of cement as far as I'm concerned."
