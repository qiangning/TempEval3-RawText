Former US House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was informed about and expressed his support in 2002 for transfers of 190,000 US dollars in mostly corporate funds from his Texas political committee to an arm of the Republican National Committee in Washington and then back to Texas, The Washington Post reported Friday.

DeLay, who has been indicted on three charges - conspiracy concerning campaign finance, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, made the acknowledgment during a meeting on Aug. 17 this year with Texas persecutor Ronnie Earle, the Post quoted anonymous sources as saying.

In late September, the Post reported, DeLay's lawyers tried unsuccessfully to head off felony criminal indictments against him on charges of violating Texas campaign law by signaling that DeLay might plead guilty to a misdemeanor.

The lawyer's principal aim was to try to preserve DeLay's leadership position under House Republican rules that bar lawmakers accused of felonies from holding such posts. DeLay was forced to step down as the House majority leader on Sept. 28 after the first of two grand jury indictments.

The last-minute negotiations between the lawyers and Earle were arranged after DeLay made what Earle considered a seriously damaging admission about his fund-raising activities during the Aug. 17 meeting, the report said.

The transfers were at the heart of the prosecutor's investigation of the alleged use of corporate funds in the 2002 Texas elections, in violation of state law. In the prosecutor's view, DeLay's admission put him in the middle of a conspiracy not only to violate that law but also to launder money, the report said.
