Japan on Friday created a full-fledged defense ministry for the first time since World War II, when the United States stripped the defeated country of its right to a military.

The upper house voted by a majority, with support from the main opposition Democratic Party, to create the defense agency. The lower house had earlier passed the bill, meaning it becomes law, a parliamentary official said.

Post-war Japan has had a "Defense Agency" with lower standing than full-fledged ministries as the 1947 constitution declared the country to be pacifist.

Despite calling its troops the "Self-Defense Forces", Japan has one of the world's biggest military budgets at 4.81 trillion yen (41.6 billion dollars) a year.
