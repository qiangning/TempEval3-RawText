US ratings agency Standard and Poor's Corp. Wednesday said it had cut to A-3 from A-2 the short term counterparty rating of Thailand's Bank of Ayudhya but affirmed a BBB long-term counterparty rating.

Bank of Ayudhya's rating has now been removed from CreditWatch, where it was placed on March 18, the agency said in a statement, but added the outlook was negative.

An "A" rating is defined as a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal in a timely manner but susceptible to outside negative factors.

Standard and Poor's said it had some concerns about the deteriorating condition of Thailand's finance sector, which has come under pressure with the downturn in the property market and the economic slowdown.

"The extent of the downturn is expected to be more significant and prolonged than is currently expected by both the regulators and the individual banks," it said, reiterating concerns made earlier this month.

"Recent initiatives announced by the Bank of Thailand may not be sufficient to contain problems within the property sector, resulting in a substantial rise in the current level of non-performing loans," it said.

The downgrade of the short-term counterparty rating recognises system- wide liquidity concerns and the banks higher vulnerability here relative to other commercial banks, the agency said.

The announcement came a week after Moody's Investors Services said it was lowering foreign currency ceilings for Thai bonds and bank deposits from A2 to A3 on concerns about the country's current account deficit.
