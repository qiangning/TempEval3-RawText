The International Monetary Fund is to lower its growth estimate for 2007 from its current prediction of 4.9 percent, IMF chief economist John Lipsky said here Tuesday.

"We will be reducing that somewhat," Lipsky told reporters, adding that the IMF nonetheless continued "to anticipate a favorable environment for growth."

He said he saw "no obvious reason to be concerned" by the recent plunge in the dollar against the euro, a trend that has prompted fears that the euro's appreciation could cut into eurozone exports and dampen growth.

Asked about the European Central Bank's interest rate policy, he replied: "We think a policy of moderate tightening remains appropriate."
