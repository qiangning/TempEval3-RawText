The Central Bank of the Philippines declared a supsension of operations at Monte de Piedad bank from Wednesday to allow the country's second oldest bank to be rehabilitated.

Central Bank deputy governor Alberto Reyes said that the decision was aimed at preventing a run on the bank following heavy withdrawals over the past two days.

"It's not a closure. The temporary stoppage in the operation of the bank is in fact a best alternative," Reyes told journalists.

Monte de Piedad, formerly controlled by the Roman Catholic church, ran into financial trouble after thousands of borrowers from a 1.8 -billion-peso (69-million-dollar) fund for small transport operators failed to repay their loans.

The fund was part of the church's "pro-poor" programs.

The archdiocese of Manila sold a controlling stake of the bank, founded in 1882, to ethnic Chinese businessman Vicente Tan in 1995.

According to bank officials, Monte de Piedad needs about 3.1 billion pesos (119 million dollars) in fresh capital.
