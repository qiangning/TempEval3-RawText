Two Palestinian militants were killed by Israeli forces overnight in two separate incidents, Palestinian medics said on Sunday.

Israeli troops shot dead 17-year-old Bilal Ashaar and wounded another Palestinian in the southern Gaza Strip late Thursday, said Moaweya Hasaneen, chief of emergency in the Palestinian Ministry of Public Health.

In a separate incident, Israeli troops shot dead a member of al- Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, armed wing of the dominant Fatah movement, in the northern West Bank city of Jenin early on Sunday.

Israel Radio reported that Shujah al-Balawi, 20, was killed in an exchange of fire with Israeli troops. Two other militants were also wounded in the clash.

Israeli forces have stepped up raids and hunts for Palestinian militants after a deadly suicide bomb attack killed six Israelis last month.
