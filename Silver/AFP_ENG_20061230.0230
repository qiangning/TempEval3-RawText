US President George W. Bush paid tribute Saturday to former president Gerald Ford, praising him for guiding the United States through a "crisis of confidence" spurred by political scandal and the end of the Vietnam War.

"He was there for the Nation when we needed him most," Bush said in his weekly radio address from his Texas ranch, where he was to ring in the New Year with First Lady Laura Bush.

"On behalf of all Americans, Laura and I send our prayers and condolences to Mrs Ford and the entire Ford family," said Bush, who was to return to Washington Monday to take part in formal memorial ceremonies.

Ford, a Republican president from August 1974 to January 1977, was best known for leading the United States out of the turbulent era after Richard Nixon stepped down in disgrace in 1974 under the Watergate scandal.

Ford, whose popularity sank when he pardoned Nixon, died late Tuesday aged 93.

"Providence gave us Gerald Ford's steady hand and calm leadership during a time of great division and turmoil. He guided America through a crisis of confidence, and helped our Nation mend its wounds by restoring faith in our system of government.

"As we say goodbye to the year 2006, we bid farewell to one of the finest public servants America has ever known. We give thanks for the gift of his remarkable life, for the caring man who touched so many lives, and the wise President who helped heal our Nation," the president said.
