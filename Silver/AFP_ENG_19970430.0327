Jordan's King Hussein has decided to grant refuge to Mussa Abu Marzuk, political leader of the Palestinian militant group HAMAS, after convincing Washington to free him, officials announced Wednesday.

The Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS), a fierce opponent of the Oslo accords with Israel for limited Palestinian autonomy, immediately welcomed the king's intervention.

"King Hussein wants this gesture to defuse a crisis sparked by the situation of Mr. Abu Marzuk whom Israel asked the United States to extradite," a senior Jordanian official told AFP.

The official, asking not to be named, said Jordan's decision to take in Abu Marzuk set a precedent since the Palestinian is the holder of a Yemeni passport and not Jordanian.

"The personal efforts of the king and his credibility within the US administration have been fruitful. The HAMAS official will soon be released by Washington and will be able to come to Jordan," he said.

Information Minister Samir Motaweh later told the official news agency Petra that Abu Marzuk would come to Jordan "without any commitment" on his part. The decision was part of the kingdom's efforts to help the peace process, he said.

Abu Marzuk, who has lived in the United States since 1982, was arrested on arrival in New York by immigration authorities in July 1995, and Israel demanded his extradition to face terrorism charges.

But in January he called off an appeal against extradition and asked to be handed over to the Jewish state, catching Israeli officials off guard as they feared damage to the peace process if he was returned.

Israel itself withdrew the extradition request on April 6, clearing the way for Abu Marzuk to be returned to either Jordan or Egypt, the only two Arab states to have peace treaties with Israel.

The Jordanian official said King Hussein raised the issue during a Washington visit in early April. "The king proposed this alternative to the United States and Israel ... and he was able to convince them."

Last week, a HAMAS delegation met here with Jordan's Prime Minister Abdel Salam Majali.

The HAMAS representative in Amman, Mohammad Nazzal, said Wednesday that his organisation "welcomes the Jordanian decision to take in Mr. Mussa Abu Marzuk." It was "highly appreciated by HAMAS and the entire Palestinian people."

The organisation is "in contact with all the parties to organize the arrival in Jordan" of Abu Marzuk, he told AFP, without giving a date.

Abu Marzuk has denied any link to anti-Israeli bomb attacks by HAMAS, saying he works only on the organisation's extensive fundraising and social activities.

HAMAS does not have an office here, but some of its officials have Jordanian nationality and live in the kingdom.
