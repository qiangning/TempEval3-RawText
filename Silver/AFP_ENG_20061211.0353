More than 200 Chinese troops headed to Pakistan's mountainous northern region on Monday at the start of the first ever joint military exercise held here by the two allies.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers and their Pakistani counterparts raised flags and played their national anthems at a special ceremony in the hill station of Abbotabad, an AFP photographer said.

Two guns boomed to herald the start of the exercise and paragliders showered fresh rose petals over the parade ground, before soldiers took part in a folk dancing display.

The Chinese contingent flew in to the garrison city of Rawalpindi near the capital Islamabad on Sunday to take part in the 10-day exercise dubbed "Friendship 2006".

PLA Major General Liu Minjiang said at the ceremony that the exercises would foster "a joint strategy and tactics to fight terrorism." Pakistani Major General Mohsin Kamal said the manoeuvres would strengthen cooperation.

The exercise comes around two weeks after Chinese President Hu Jintao pledged to take strategic ties with Pakistan to a "new level" during his first ever visit to the South Asian country.

"This is the first time that a PLA contingent has arrived in Pakistan" on an exercise, a senior Pakistani military official said, adding that Pakistani troops visited China for joint exercises in 2004.

"The exercise is a display of the mutual commitment and resolve to fight terrorism, besides bolstering time-tested friendship between the two countries," the official said on condition of anonymity.

After the ceremony in Abbotabad the soldiers were due to head to the mountains further north for the exercises, the official said.

Beijing remains Islamabad's largest arms supplier and the two are jointly developing the JF-17 Thunder fighter jet. China is also providing major industrial and economic assistance.

Islamabad meanwhile is helping Beijing deal with the perceived threat of Muslim separatists in China's western Xinjiang region, which borders Kazakhstan and Pakistan.

In late 2003 Pakistan said it had killed Hasan Mahsum, identified by China as its "top terrorist", in a raid in Pakistan's South Waziristan tribal region.
