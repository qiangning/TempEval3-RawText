The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) is to inject 13 million U.S. dollars into Nigeria's immunization activities in 2007.

Edugie Abebe, chief executive of Nigerian National Program on Immunization, said on Thursday the money would be sent to deserving Nigerian states, based on the number of additional children they had immunized.

Abebe told a press conference that Nigeria is qualified for the movement because it has passed a "data quality audit" which was conducted by international auditors sent by the GAVI.

She explained that the auditors who assessed immunization activities observed that additional 650,000 children were immunized in Nigeria between 2004 and 2005.

The GAVI, an alliance of many organizations concerned with immunization activities, was formed in 2001 with its headquarters in Geneva. The GAVI Fund now has over 3 billion U.S. dollars in commitments over the next ten years.
