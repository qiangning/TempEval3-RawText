The United States said on Monday that it rejects the interference of internal affairs of Lebanon by Syria and Iran and said such efforts should be stopped.

"And we certainly would reject any efforts on the part of outside governments to try and interfere or influence" Lebanon's political process, State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said at a briefing.

"And you certainly know we've spoken to and continue to speak to the fact that the Syrian government continues its interference into Lebanese affairs. We definitely want to see that stopped," Casey said.

The United States does not want to see any other outside actors, including Iran, interfering in the legitimate decision-making of the Lebanese political system, Casey added.

The United States has accused Syrian officials of involving in the murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri. Syria has denied it has any links to the killing of Hariri.

The United States has also accused Iran of providing support for Lebanon's Hezbollah, a group branded by the United States as terrorist.
