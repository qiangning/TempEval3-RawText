Five police officers were killed in an ambush by drug gangs in the western Mexican state of Michoacan on Tuesday, state prosecutors said.

An investigative officer and four police officers were shot dead when conducting a routine patrol in the mountain town of Aguililla where farmers grow opium poppies and marijuana, a spokesman for the state prosecutor said.

The victims' bodies were found bullet-riddled.

The incident happened close to Tumbuscatio, where Mexican soldiers killed one drug trafficker and arrested two last week, and seized a vast cache of weapons.

Drug violence has surged in western Mexican states like Michoacan and Guerrero recently, despite efforts by the government of President Vicente Fox to break the gangs.

Since the beginning of this year, 30 police have been killed in drug-related violence.
