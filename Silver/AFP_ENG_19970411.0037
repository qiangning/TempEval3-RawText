South Korean prosecutors Friday summoned two senior opposition politicians for questioning over a massive graft scandal enveloping the Hanbo business group, prompting charges of a political conspiracy.

The Prosecutor General's Office called in Kim Sang-Hyon of the main opposition National Congress for New Politics and Kim Yong-Hwan of the second opposition United Liberal Democratic Party.

Prosecutors also summoned a ruling New Korea Party presidential hopeful, Kim Deok-Ryong, who said he would respond to the summons around this weekend.

The three were the first to be questioned among 33 politicians, including 20 incumbent lawmakers, who allegedly received money from Chung Tae-Soo, founder of the failed Hanbo conglomerate.

Hanbo, the country's 14th largest conglomerate, collapsed in January under debts of 5.8 billion dollars, prompting charges of high-level corruption. Eleven people, including four lawmakers, have been arrested and jailed.

The summoning of politicians came after prosecutors pledged a new probe into politicians whose names have surfaced in the course investigations into the massive loans-for-kickbacks scandal engulfing Hanbo.

The prosecution had said that aside from the arrested four, they had no plans to investigate other politicians who allegedly took customary "rice cake expenditures."

Rice cake expenditures are cash gifts of anywhere between tens of dollars and tens of thousand dollars, which are offered with no clear strings attatched.

The prosecution's reversal in policy triggered charges of political conspiracy from both the ruling and opposition camps.

Second opposition party leader Kim Jong-Pil accused the investigation of being "a ploy to protect (South Korean President Kim Young-Sam's second son) Kim Hyun-Chul."

Kim Hyun-Chul, 39, is to face parliamentary questioning on April 25 on allegations that he was at the centre of the Hanbo scandal and other charges of corruption and influence peddling.

The Christian-run Kookmin Daily said the government might be sending a warning signal to politicians in the run up to the parliamentary questioning of the president's son.

Kim Deok-Ryong, the ruling party presidential hopeful summoned by the prosecution, said he had fallen victim to a conspiracy by rival factions within the ruling camp ahead of the presidential election in December.
