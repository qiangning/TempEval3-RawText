Jose Maria Sison, the exiled founder of the Philippines' decades-old communist insurgency, said Monday he fears he could be abducted by the United States in its fight against international terrorism.

The US State Department and western allies have designated the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), which Sison established in 1968, and its armed wing the New People's Army (NPA), as "foreign terrorist organizations".

Sison, who lives in exile in the Netherlands where he is seeking political asylum, accused President Gloria Arroyo's government of implicating the CPP-NPA in terrorism to justify his arrest by Washington, Manila's top military ally.

Arroyo has suspended peace talks with the CPP-NPA after the rebels refused a government demand for a nationwide ceasefire. The insurgent leadership also wants Manila to get the group off the West's terrorist watchlist.

"My Philippine, European and American lawyers are looking into the possibility that the US and Arroyo governments are fabricating stories and intelligence dossiers against me in order to lay the ground for my 'rendition' by the CIA and other operatives of the US," Sison said in a statement.

Sison equated the term "rendition" with "kidnapping".

The term "rendition" refers to allegations that the US government is flying terrorist suspects to secret bases and third countries for interrogation.
