The European Central Bank said Friday it had sold 23 tonnes of gold in line with an existing international central banks' gold agreement.

"On November 30, the ECB completed gold sales amounting to 23 tonnes of gold. These sales are in full conformity with the central banks' gold agreement dated September 27, 2004, of which the ECB is a signatory," the bank said in a brief statement.

The ECB did not provide any further details.

The 2004 gold agreement, signed by the ECB, the 12 national central banks of the euro area, as well as the central banks of Switzerland and Sweden, limits combined gold sales to a maximum 500 tonnes per year over a five-year period, or a maximum 2,500 tonnes over all of the five years.
