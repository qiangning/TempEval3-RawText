Britain's newspapers -- tabloid and quality alike -- have already cast their vote in the May 1 elections, ganging up on Prime Minister John Major's Tory party and backing Labour party leader Tony Blair.

According to CMS Precis, a media monitoring company, an analysis of favourable, unfavourable and neutral articles published on each of the two main parties over the last three weeks reveals harsher treatment for the government than the opposition.

Unlike its predecessors, Blair's "New Labour" party has won wide print support while the Conservatives have seen their traditional backers walk away.

The bastions of left-wing journalism, The Guardian and The Mirror, now have The Sun in their pro-Blair camp. The Times hesitates, The Daily Express vacillates and the pin-striped businessman's staid companion, The Financial Times, seems on the point of making Blair the star of its pink pages.

While the Tories still retain a number of "friendly" newspapers, such as The Daily Telegraph, their image and their elections messages are generally taking a cruel beating in the 14 million newspapers Britain sells every day.

Perhaps the hardest blow was the loss of the once ferociously Conservative Sun newspaper, with a circulation of four million, the world's biggest-selling paper.

Owned by Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born US media magnate, the paper trumpeted on page one its switch to Blair, who Murdoch sees as a keen advocate of the policies espoused by former Tory prime minister Margaret Thatcher.

On Friday's front page of The Times, another paper in Murdoch's stable, the officially Conservative stance seemed overlooked when the story started "The government's European policy was in confusion last night..."

In fact, the desire of many of the pro-Tory papers to see a more anti- European position from the government has resulted in much attention on splits in Major's party.

"Battle for Britain" was how The Daily Mail headlined a story on the divisions, urging Eurosceptics to come forward and stand up to Major.

Blair was ready to capitalise on the issue, with a recent contribution -- in The Sun -- titled: "My Love for the pound by Tony Blair - Sun Exclusive!"

In an April 16 editorial, the paper said: "We don't want our laws, our taxes and our interest rates imposed on us by unelected foreigners... If Labour can acknowledge that fact, they will govern from a position of even greater strength."

It is in that leftward step by Conservative papers and the move to the right by Tony Blair that many observers see a waltz that is going to carry both partners right up to the polling date.
