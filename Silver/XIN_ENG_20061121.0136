The first international forum on Lao Tzu, known as China's "father of philosophy", opened Tuesday in Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu province.

Under the theme "Nature, Science and Harmony", the forum would focus on the essence and relevancy to modern life of Lao Tzu's culture based on his work Tao Te Ching, said Gao Zhanxiang, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC and chairman of Chinese Culture Promotion Association.

The forum was attended by 120 experts and scholars from more than 40 countries and regions who made a declaration on the status, influence and future development of Lao Tzu's culture, Gao said.

Lao Tzu, the first philosopher in Chinese history and father of Taoism, was born 2,500 years ago in the Zhou Dynasty (11th Century B.C -- 221 B.C.), said Zhang Bingyu, an official in charge of foreign affairs.

"The reason for holding the forum in Gansu was that Lao Tzu was said to have flown up to heaven from Linzhao town of Gansu, making it a kind of pilgrimage center for Taoism," Zhang said.

Tao Te Ching, the universal Taoist text book written in only 5,000 ancient Chinese characters, contained the quintessential spirit of Chinese thought and philosophy, Zhang said.

It had been translated into dozens of languages and studied by thousands of scholars all over the world, Zhang said.

The Lao Tzu' only work had more than 250 different editions and hundreds of millions of copies in circulation, second only to the Bible, according to UNESCO.
