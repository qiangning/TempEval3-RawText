Italian forces from the multinational protection force for lawless Albania prepared to dock at the rebel-held port of Vlore early Monday, witnesses said.

The boats arrived off-shore around dawn and were sitting several hundred meters (yards) from the quayside where the troops and their equipment will unload. There were two vessels, an amphibious craft, the San Giusto (eds: correct) and the Vitorio Veneto.

When the troops unload they will be the first to deploy in a rebel- held area of the country which has been gripped by lawlessness and banditry for nearly two months.

Italy leads the 6,000-strong force, half of which has already been deployed in the country. Additional Italian troops and a Greek force of some 130 men and equipment are due to meet up with the soldiers aboard the ships later Monday.
