Two moderate earthquakes struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Wednesday but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties, geologists said.

An earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale hit at 10:54 am (0254 GMT). It was centred 130 kilometres (80 miles) west of Kendari, the capital of Southeast Sulawesi province, and some 33 kilometres underground, the meteorological office said.

The tremor was felt in the town of Kolaka, 36 kilometres southeast of the epicentre.

An earlier earthquake of 5.6 on the Richter scale hit at 6:56 am and was centred 210 kilometres north-northeast of Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province.

The tremor was felt in Manado and on the nearby Sangihe islands. It came after another undersea earthquake Tuesday off the coast of Taiwan set off a brief tsunami alert. The quake left two people dead in Taiwan.

The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity.

Indonesia was the nation worst hit by the earthquake-triggered Asian tsunami in December 2004, which killed some 168,000 people in Aceh province.
