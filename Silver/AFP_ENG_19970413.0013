Singapore is to fine-tune its much-envied public housing system by tightening financing procedures to curb speculation on the heavily subsidised flats which are home to nine out of 10 citizens.

The new rules unveiled Saturday are aimed at deterring the use of subsidised loans to buy and sell the simple but comfortable flats to reap capital gains.

The regulations also intend to endure that flat-buyers borrow within their means, officials and analysts said.

"The basic policy of public housing is to provide a roof over your head, not to help you make a profit," Chan Hiap Kong, senior director of the property consultancy Colliers Jardine, told the Sunday Times.

"It will introduce more prudence into the market and extract the speculative element," Chan said of the measures announced by National Development Minister Lim Hng Kiang.

The new mortgage financing policy will make flats built by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) more expensive for those who already own property.

The government said a "credit assessment" criteria would be imposed on buyers to ensure that they are not tempted by low interest rates and rising resale prices to borrow beyond their means.

Buyers of HDB flats will now be entitled to only two subsidised mortgage loans which come with an interest rate of 3.5 percent per annum, below the market rate of 5.75 percent.

The loan amount will depend on the age and household income of borrowers. Buyers will have to use up the money in their pension-fund accounts before they are granted mortgage loans.

The maximumn loan amount will be worked out in such a way that borrowers' monthly repayments do not exceed 40 percent of the household income.

Buyers of resale flats will have to pay market interest rates if they earn more than 8,000 Singapore dollars (5,714 US) a month, or if they own private property.

"The objective of this latest revision in mortgage financing policy for HDB flats is to bring it closer to market practice and to rationalise the subsidies for the purchase of HDB flats," the ministry of national development said.

The measures would check rampant "upgrading" by Singaporeans who put pressure on their budgets by seeking to move to more spacious flats, analysts said.

The steps come on the top of credit-tightening and tax measures introduced in May last year against excessive speculation in private property which have softened real-estate prices.

Market speculation Friday sent property stocks reeling, with the Stock Exchange of Singapore Property Index ending down five percent -- the largest one-day fall since the May curbs.

Analysts said the steps were less stringent than had been speculated about in the market.

"The new measures will not affect the selling prices of new flats. There might be some downward pressure on the resale flat prices. However the impact is difficult to assess at this moment," a government spokesman said.

"I think definitely the home market will be affected but to what extent nobody can tell," said a property agent, adding that property stocks were expected to stabilise Monday given the week-end selling bout.

The HDB, set up in 1960 as the sole public housing authority in the island state of three million people, has built some 650,000 subsidised flats that house about 90 percent of Singaporeans.

Most of them were able to buy their own flats by drawing on hefty compulsory social security savings in the Central Provident Fund and low-interest mortgage loans.

But demand for new HDB flats and financing has risen sharply since 1993 following measures which made it easier for owners to sell their units on the open market, causing resale prices to increase.

Annual demand has since averaged at 70,000 new HDB flats, compared to the 30,000 the HDB builds.
