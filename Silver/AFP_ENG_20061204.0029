The dollar rebounded from 20-month lows against the euro Monday afternoon as investors bought back the US currency following its recent losses, dealers said.

The euro fell to 1.3316 dollars from 1.3337 in New York Friday when it charted its highest levels since March 2005.

The dollar rose to 115.72 yen from 115.43 yen. The euro slipped to 153.89 yen from an all-time high of 154.11 in New York.

The dollar had taken another beating in the morning after Friday's surprisingly weak US manufacturing data further jolted confidence in the world's largest economy.

"But players bought back the dollar in the afternoon as they were concerned about a fast, continued decline," said Nobuo Kihara, a dealer at BNP Paribas.

"However, dollar-selling momentum has yet to be erased," Kihara said. "There is no guarantee that the day's gains against the euro or the yen will lead to a stable rebound."

The European Central Bank is widely expected later this week to hike interest rates, giving further support to the single unit, while many here predict a rise in Japanese borrowing costs by early next year.

Friday's fall in the dollar was triggered by the Institute for Supply Management's index of US manufacturing activity, which dropped to 49.50 from 51.2 in October, falling below the 50 mark to indicate a contraction in the sector for the first time since April 2003.

Pundits said the fall could end all remaining talk of further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

Looking ahead, the market is now keenly awaiting US jobs data due later this week and a news conference by the European Central Bank governor, dealers said.

Markets are also braced for the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to 0.50 percent going into early 2007, the first rate hike since July when it ended five years of zero interest.

Participants are also on alert for Japan's revised third-quarter growth estimate and the central bank's Tankan quarterly business confidence survey due later this month for fresh guidance on the interest rate outlook, dealers said.

The dollar was mixed against Asian currencies. It slipped to 1.5425 Singapore dollars from 1.5427 late Friday and to 927.65 South Korean won from 928.70.

The dollar rose to 49.650 Philippine pesos from 49.470, to 32.349 Taiwan dollars from 32.270, to 35.915 Thai baht from 35.730 and to 9,162.5 Indonesian rupiah from 9,140.0.
