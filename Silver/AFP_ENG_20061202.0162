A powerful Islamic movement on Saturday seized control of a key Somali township, pushing the Horn of Africa nation closer to an all-out war, officials said.

As the international community scrambled to avoid fresh clashes, Islamic forces said they had taken control of Dinsoor, about 270 kilometres (170 miles) west of the capital Mogadishu, after pro-government militia pulled out.

"We are telling you that Dinsoor is under the control of the Islamic courts," said Sheikh Abdurahim Ali Muddey, the spokesman for the Supreme Islamic Council of Somalia (SICS).

"We will take military steps if any force violates the area," he added, referring to transitional government based in Baidoa, about 110 kilometres (69) miles north.

Local Islamic officials said plans were underway to impose Islamic law in the township.

"Mogadishu has sent delegates here. They are telling people that Islamic courts are preparing to take control of the whole region and implement Islamic Sharia law," Osmail Adan Kerrow, a local Islamic commander told AFP from the region's trading post.

Somali government officials protested the advance, saying the Islamists were seeking to provoke new unrest in the country that has been wracked by unrest since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled in 1991 and is currently reeling from devastating floods.

"This is provocation, we are still in the stage of calling them to stop" lawmaker Madobe Nunow said.

The seizure, which violates a previous truce and mutual recognition pact between the SICS and the government, comes days after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi secured parliamentary approval for his plans to fight the Islamists.

Addis Ababa denies deploying thousands of troops across the border but acknowledges sending military advisers and trainers to assist the internationally backed but largely powerless Somali government.

Mainly Christian Ethiopia has watched with growing concern the rise on its southeastern border of the Islamists, who seized Mogadishu in June and now control most of southern and central Somalia.

With a large ethnic Somali population, Ethiopia fears radicalization of its sizable Muslim minority by the Islamists, some of whom are accused of links to Al-Qaeda, who have imposed strict Sharia law in areas they control.

Somali watchers have warned that an all-out war in Somalia would suck in Addis Ababa's chief rival, Eritrea, also accused of supporting the Islamists, thereby pushing war in a regional conflict.

The new development comes as the UN Security Council mulled a United States proposal to lift the 1992 arms embargo to enable African nations send in peacekeepers to protect the government.

And as the UN and aid groups delivered relief to nearly a million people hit by floods, the Islamists warned the world body from neither deploying any Ethiopian planes or sending any Ethiopians to work in Somalia.

"We cannot endure our enemies using humanitarian assistant to spy, if the UN agencies try to use Ethiopian planes, including helicopters to drop food in the flood-hit areas, we will bring them down," said Sheikh Mukhta Robow, the deputy defence chief for the Islamists.

"We know that every Ethiopian national is a spy. So, we will not tolerate Ethiopian planes flying over our territories," he added.

Asked why the Islamists were restricting the UN operations, he said: "They drop food today, and tomorrow they drop bombs after they have carried out surveillance over all areas where we are based."

The floods have killed at least 120 people and displaced around 300,000 since unusually heavy rains started to pound the country in October.
