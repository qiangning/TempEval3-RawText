The IMF is to continue providing financial support to Russia despite disappointment with the country's economic performance in 1996, IMF director general Michel Camdessus said here on Wednesday.

Supporting Russia financially "is our raison d'etre (reason for existing) -- we must do it and it will be done," Camdessus told students at the State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) here.

But he also warned that failure to improve tax collection might open the way to anarchy or dicatorship.

And the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that no decision had yet been taken on the release of three pending monthly instalments of a 10-billion-dollar loan to Russia, spread over three years.

"If the decision had already been made I would already have left," he said. He was due to leave late Thursday.

The January-March instalments are worth about one billion dollars. Last year the IMF delayed several instalments because the government had fallen far behind its targets for tax collection.

Camdessus arrived here Monday to finalise discussions with the government on its 1997 reform programme.

He held talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and newly- appointed first deputy prime ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, whom President Boris Yeltsin brought into the cabinet to give new impetus to Russia's sluggish economic reforms.

Camdessus said he was convinced that the new government had the necessary determination to tackle the main problems bedevilling Russia, especially inadequate tax collection, the delayed resumption of economic growth and corruption.

"I talk of determination because I know these people, I know of their personal determination to do it."

"At times (Russia's) progress has been so slow that the support of the IMF has been interpreted by some as reflecting a kind of political complacency, or sheer misjudgement from the IMF. It is time to show that this pessimism is misplaced," he said.

He warned that if the government failed to solve the problem of tax collection, it "risks encouraging anarchy or dictatorship, or both."

Last year the government managed to collect only about 60 percent of projected tax revenue.

The new government has announced that it will target monopolies over natural resources, such as United Energy Systems (UES) and Gazprom, in its drive to boost tax revenue.

The monopolies owe the government billions of dollars in taxes, but argue that in turn their customers, including government ministries, are heavily indebted to them.
