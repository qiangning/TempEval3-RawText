French judges probing the so-called Clearstream dirty tricks scandal will quiz Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin -- accused of using the affair to damage his political rival, Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy -- solely as a witness, aides to Villepin said Saturday.

The status of "simple witness" being accorded to the prime minister means that he is not being treated as a suspect in the case centring on bogus allegations of illegal accounts held at a Luxembourg clearing-bank.

Villepin's office said the go-ahead for the two judges heading the inquiry to interview him would be given at the next cabinet meeting.

The judges had said in November that "an interview does indeed appear useful for elucidating the truth and will take place at the moment we judge to be opportune."

Villepin's aides repeated that the prime minister welcomed the chance to speak to judges Jean-Marie d'Huy and Henri Pons to give his side of events.

It will only be the second time in history that a serving prime minister gives testimony in a judicial investigation. Socialist Lionel Jospin was quizzed some 15 years ago over illegal funding for his party.

The Clearstream affair erupted in April and for a time appeared to threaten Villepin's future as prime minister.

He has vehemently denied that as foreign minister in early 2004 he ordered a secret probe into claims that Sarkozy was on a list of names of alleged account-holders at Clearstream.

D'Huy and Pons have already questioned as witnesses Villepin's predecessor as prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, and current Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie.
