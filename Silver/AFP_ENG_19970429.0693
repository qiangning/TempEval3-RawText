Japanese share prices got off to a strong start in post-holiday trading Wednesday, following a surge on Wall Street the previous day, brokers said.

The Nikkei stock average gained 307.83 points, or 1.6 percent, from Monday in the first one hour to stand at 18,978.20 at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT).

"The upsurge in New York encouraged market participants here," Harushige Kobayashi of Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. said, adding the Tokyo market would probably hold firm for the day.

"The next target for the Nikkei will be around 19,200 points scored in late February," he said.

The Dow Jones index in New York gained 179.01 points Tuesday -- its second biggest one-day rise in terms of points -- to close at 6,962.03.

A broker with a mid-sized securities house here said: "Declines in volume amid the holiday week is having a positive effect on the market, with a smaller number of investors turning sellers on the upside."

Harushige said overall share prices also got a boost from Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.'s share buy-back plans.

The nation's largest chemicals maker announced on Monday it would outlay 40 billion yen (315 million dollars) on a buy-back of 100 million shares.
