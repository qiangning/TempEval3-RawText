Israeli officials downplayed the chance of armed conflict with Syria Monday, a day after a senior intelligence officer said Damascus was preparing for war with the Jewish state.

"Syria is constructing military apparatus to try and counter the supremacy of (Israeli) air, ground and naval forces, but nothing indicates that it intends to attack us," Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told public radio.

The chief of parliament's influential foreign affairs and defense committee, Tsahi Hanegbi, told the radio: "No one in Israel has precise information on Syria's intentions and we are examining all possibilities.

"The army takes into account these estimates and adapts them on the ground," he said.

On Sunday, General Yossi Beidetz, the head of the military intelligence research division, told a cabinet meeting that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was "preparing his forces for a military conflict" with Israel.

"Syria has accelerated the production of long-range missiles and has deployed anti-tank rockets on its border with Israel," a senior intelligence official quoted Beidetz as saying, referring to the armistice line on the occupied Golan Heights.

In a later statement, a spokesman said: "The army does not have any information indicating offensive intentions (by Syria) on the border."
