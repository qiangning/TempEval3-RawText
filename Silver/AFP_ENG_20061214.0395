Suspected separatist insurgents shot dead four men and injured three, including a policeman, on Thursday in Thailand's restive Muslim-majority south, police said.

A 25-year-old Buddhist trader was gunned down at his mobile stall in Narathiwat, one of three insurgency-torn provinces bordering Malaysia, police said, adding that the victim's nephew was also wounded.

When police rushed to the scene, militants using a mobile phone detonated a bomb near the stall, injuring one policeman, they said.

Also in Narathiwat, a 46-year-old Muslim man, a former village chief, was shot dead by militants.

In neighboring Yala province, six gunmen burst into a local government office earlier in the day and opened fire, killing two Buddhist engineers and seriously injuring a woman.

Deadly attacks have surged in the three southern provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat in the past month, despite moves by Thailand's post-coup government to forge peace in the region.

The junta chief and coup leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin was in Pattani Thursday to meet local army commanders, but an army spokesman said the one-day trip was not related to the deteriorating situation in the region.

The area was an independent sultanate until it was annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand in 1902. Separatist violence has erupted periodically ever since, with the latest unrest killing more than 1,700 people since January 2004.
