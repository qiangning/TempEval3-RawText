A Hong Kong group said Wednesday it planned to make a landing next month on the Diaoyu Islands, an archipelago claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan.

The group, which backs China's claim, announced the protest after Japanese supporters of Tokyo's claim said they wanted to land there in May.

The protestors, called the Protect the Diaoyu Islands Committee, are led by members of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest political group.

Tsang Kin-shing, a legislator, said a group of 40 people would fly from Hong Kong to Taipei and team up with around 100 others from Taiwan and the United States.

They would then set sail from a northern port in Taiwan to the archipelago, hoping to land there on May 18 "and camp there for four to five days," Tsang said.

He added "there is a possibility that we will meet them (the Japanese)."

"We will do our utmost to refrain from violence. We intend to ask them whether they have applied for a visa from China in order to be there."

The islands, believed to lie in an oil-rich area of the East China Sea, are known to Chinese as the Diaoyus and to Japanese as the Senkakus.

The three-way dispute over ownership was revived last July after an ultra-right-wing Japanese group erected a lighthouse on one of the islands as a symbol of Tokyo's claim, sparking anti-Japanese sentiment in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.
