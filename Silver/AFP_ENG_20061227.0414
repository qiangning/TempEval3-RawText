The New York Yankees unveiled Major League Baseball's latest Japanese import on Wednesday, announcing they have signed lefthanded pitcher Kei Igawa to a five-year contract.

The move comes less than two weeks after New York's American League East rivals Boston signed Daisuke Matsuzaka to a six-year, 52-million-dollar deal.

Financial terms were not disclosed, but the Yomiuri Shimbun reported two weeks ago that Igawa's contract is worth 20 million dollars.

Igawa, 27, became the fifth Japanese player to come to the major leagues this offseason, joining Matsuzaka, Red Sox lefthander Hideki Okajima, Tampa Bay Devil Rays infielder Akinori Iwamura and Pittsburgh Pirates righthander Masumi Kuwata.

The Yankees earned exclusive negotiation rights with Igawa after posting a winning bid of 26 million dollars on November 28.

They had until midnight on Thursday to reach a contract agreement with Igawa, who otherwise would have returned to his Japanese club, the Hanshin Tigers.

Igawa will likely join a starting rotation which already includes Mike Mussina, Andy Pettitte, Chien-Ming Wang and Carl Pavano. The Yankees reportedly are looking to trade 43-year-old lefthander Randy Johnson, who has underachieved in his two seasons in New York.

Igawa went 14-9 with a 2.97 ERA for the Tigers last season. He recorded 197 strikeouts to lead the Central League in strikeouts for the third time in eight seasons.
