Jordan slashed a pounding 13-0 victory over Macao of China and Iraq drew 0-0 with Syria here Friday in the final preliminary round of the soccer tournament in the Doha Asian Games.

Iraq and Jordan, with seven and five points respectively, have become the winners of two groups to qualify for the next stage.

Syria, together with Kyrgyzstan which tied with Tajikistan 2-2 earlier on Friday, is also able to stay in Doha as runner-up of Gruop B.

According to the newest rule issued by the Asian Games organizer,the runners-up are to take the berths of the next round in the tournament because Turkmenistan and Yemen had withdrawn from the Games.

Despite finishing on the same points with Jordan and Kyrgyzstan in Group A, Tajikistan fall out on goal difference due to Kyrgyzstan's three-goal superiority.

However, as the best third-placer, the middle Asian side still saw a glimpse of hope if Iran was banned from the game.

According to news reaching here, the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) announced a decision earlier to suspend the Iran Association from all international games.

Till now, no official advice has been received from the Asian Football Conference about Iran's suspension or what changes would be made to competition, said the official website of the 15th Asian Games.

In another uneventful game in Group A, Singapore drew with Indonesia 1-1 and both were eliminated form the competition.

The eight teams must play this preliminary round because they had not competed in the 2002 Asian Games soccer tournament.
