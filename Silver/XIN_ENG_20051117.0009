A native of the Dominican Republic was selected Wednesday as the designer of a memorial for victims of Flight 587, the plane that crashed in Queens, New York, shortly after takeoff on its way to Santo Domingo, the mayor's office announced.

Renowned artist Freddy Rodriguez was selected from a field of six finalists for the memorial honoring the 265 victims of the Nov. 12, 2001 tragedy, said Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The 2-million-dollar memorial, financed by public and private funding, should be completed by fall 2006 -- in time for the fifth anniversary of the crash.

The plane was leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport on its way for the Dominican Republic when it plunged into the Queens neighborhood of Belle Harbor in the Rockaways. All passengers and crew on board were killed, along with five people on the ground.

"This process has brought us together to find the best way to honor and remember those we lost in a meaningful and enduring manner," Bloomberg said.

Family members of the victims have complained about the location of the site. On Saturday, at a service marking the fourth anniversary of the crash, family members questioned why the memorial was slated to go up about a mile from the crash site.
