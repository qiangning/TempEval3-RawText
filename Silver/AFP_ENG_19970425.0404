Maronite Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir, head of Lebanon's largest Christian community, said Friday he hopes Pope John Paul II's visit will help the country's recovery from its 1975-1990 civil war.

"I hope this visit will bring the Lebanese together so their wounded country can heal," Sfeir told AFP at his Bkerke residence north of Beirut.

But he painted a bleak picture of the current situation in Lebanon, saying it was "unenviable."

Lebanon's "sovereignty and independence are flouted and it doesn't have the freedom to decide for itself," he said. But "the solidarity of all Lebanese will yield positive results in the long term."

The pope's visit on May 10-11, "while pastoral, will have political connotations because we can't dissociate the spiritual from the social and the political."

Sfeir said the pope "will not directly mention the Syrian or the non- Syrian presence in Lebanon ... even if he was the first to demand that Lebanon recovers its independence and sovereignty.

"But this will occur at the opportune time, because regional and international conditions don't permit it at the present time."

Some 35,000 Syrian soldiers are stationed on two-thirds of Lebanese territory, while the Israeli military occupies a strip of south Lebanon just north of Israel's border.

A synod on Lebanon, which met in November 1995 in Rome at the pope's request, called for the "end of the Israeli occupation" and "the departure of the Syrian troops."

The second point has been criticized by several Lebanese Moslem leaders who said the Syrian military presence does not affect Lebanon's sovereignty.

The cardinal also said the Christian opposition would not be able to meet the pope as it has requested. "Like others, it can always send him a written petition," Sfeir added.
