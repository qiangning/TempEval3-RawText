Seven persons were arrested on Saturday along with their two cars full of explosives in Afghan capital Kabul, the spokesperson of Ministry of Defense said.

"This afternoon at about 3:30, Afghan National Army (ANA) seized two cars full of explosives in the city of Kabul, and arrested four persons in the car. The third car was also seized by ANA after finding the direct relation with the first two cars although there is no explosive inside, and the three persons in the car were arrested afterwards," spokesperson Zahir Azimi told Xinhua.

The spokesperson refused to comment about if there is any suicide attack attempts behind it.

Taliban militants in Afghanistan have intensified attacks against Afghan and foreign troops this year, especially by use of suicide attacks.

A people was arrested in eastern Nangarhar province on Friday for taking many explosives in his body and the suicide explosion attempt. On the same day, another suicide attacker in the province exploded the bomb in his body and injured one passerby.

The Afghan government has sent more troops for further investigation.
