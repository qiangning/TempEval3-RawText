Britain's former Formula 1 racer Nigel Mansell edged out Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi by a fraction of a second to win the inaugural South African Grand Prix Masters at the Kyalami race track in Johannesburg on Sunday.

Mansell was pushed all the way by his fellow former Formula 1 World Champion and crossed the line in a time of 50 minutes 55.154 seconds, reported the SAPA news agency.

Fittipaldi, who won the F1 Championship in 1972 and 1974, followed just 0.408 seconds later. Italy's Ricardo Patrese completed the podium when he was next past the chequered flag in 51 minutes 15.816 seconds.

Mansell, the pre-race favourite, was clearly overjoyed at his success.

"It was unbelievable, I tried to pull away from Emerson but he kept coming at me," Mansell said.

"I didn't have the traction around the corners to pull away. What a race, what a race. He almost got me at the end but I hung on."

Fittipaldi, who also won the Indycar Series in 1989 and 1993, was full of admiration for Mansell's drive.

"Nigel made no mistakes. It was a fantastic display of driving, " he said.

Sunday's Grand Prix Masters race was the first race of its kind for former F1 drivers over the age of 45 and there were more than 70,000 fans in attendance.

While Mansell and Fittipaldi were the only world champions taking part -- Australia's 1980 winner Alan Jones withdrew on the eve of the event -- the 14 drivers in the race were some of the true legends of the sport and the performance they put on was appreciated by all, the SAPA said.
