South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has denied reported differences between President Thabo Mbeki and his party deputy Jacob Zuma over ways to heal a rift within the party.

The party's powerful National Working Committee (NWC) said on Monday evening this emerged from its weekly meeting held in Johannesburg earlier in the day.

"The NWC received and discussed the joint report of the ANC president and deputy president as mandated by the ANC national executive committee (NEC) on September 9," the committee said in a statement, which was carried by the SAPA news agency.

"Media reports to the effect that there were differences between the president and deputy president on the substance of the report are false and without basis," it said.

South African media has suggested that Mbeki and Zuma had been unable to come to an agreement on proposals to deal with tension in party after Mbeki sacked Zuma as the country's deputy president in June and Zuma was prosecuted on two corruption charges.

Zuma has repeatedly protested his innocence. His supporters hold that the corruption and the newly-emerged rape allegations were part of a political conspiracy by the ANC elite to block his path to the presidency in 2009, after Mbeki completes his second term.

Zuma currently is still the No. 2 figure of the ANC. Some political analysts in South Africa have said he could easily win the 2009 elections if he can be acquitted of corruption charges and succeed Mbeki as the party's president in 2007.

The reported tensions inside the ruling party were described as the most serious one since ANC took power in post-apartheid South Africa 11 years ago.

ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe was reportedly tasked to facilitate a final report for the next weekend's NEC meeting, described by local media as a "make-or-break" one.

The NWC said the report it discussed at Monday's meeting captured the substance of "interactions" between Mbeki and Zuma over the last two months.

"The report was accepted by the NWC," the committee said. "The working committee was satisfied that the report would form the basis for a substantive discussion at the NEC meeting scheduled to take place this weekend."
