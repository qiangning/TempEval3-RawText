Northern Iran was hit by a moderate earthquake on Tuesday, but there were no reports on possible casualties or damage so far.

Local TV said that the earthquake, measuring 5 on the Richter scale, took place in Agh Ghala, a small town in Golestan province of Northern Iran, which is near the Caspian Sea.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 shook southern Iran on Sunday, killing 10 people and injuring 70.

Earthquakes usually happen in Iran because the country is situated in some of the world's most active seismic fault lines. Statistics showed that on average, there is at least one slight earthquake every day in Iran.

On Dec. 26, 2003, a quake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale hit southeastern city Bam, killing nearly 262,000 people.

On Feb. 22, 2004, another quake measuring 6.4 left more than 600 dead and 1400 injured on the outskirt of Zarand, a town 250 km northwest of Bam.
