Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Tuesday afternoon that Israel would decide within weeks what anti-rocket defense system to erect in areas bordering the Gaza Strip, Israel's local newspaper Jerusalem Post reported on its website.

Sneh said that the Israeli government was examining four different systems produced both in Israel and abroad, but their efficiency was as yet unproven.

Sneh made the announcement hours after an Israeli civilian was critically wounded in a Qassam rocket hit on a factory in Sderot, a city in south Israel.

Since Monday, more than 25 Qassam rockets have landed in the Negev, seven in Sderot and one which scored a direct hit on a home, that caused extensive damage, in a nearby kibbutz.

Meanwhile, Israel Defense Forces Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz also said Monday that Israel was not "coming to terms" with Qassam rocket fire, however, he was not currently in favor of launching a massive ground operation into Gaza to stop the daily rocket attacks on towns in the western Negev.
