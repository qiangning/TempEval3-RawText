A leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Gaza said on Thursday that there was a slight progress made on the issue of free the Israeli soldier held by Palestinian militant groups, adding that more talks were still needed.

Osama al-Muzini here said that the "Israeli occupation is softening stance gradually," however, "there were many points need to be agreed upon."

Meanwhile, al-Muzini revealed that Israel has accepted the principle of prisoners-exchange which had been rejected at the beginning.

He explained that Israel refuses the coincidence principle, saying that "Until recently, Israel used to demand unconditional release of Corporal Gilad Shalit, but now it had agreed to release

Palestinian prisoners in exchange of him."

Corporal Gilad Shalit was captured by three militant groups, led by Hamas, in a cross-border raid last June. The captors demand to swap him for a number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.

However, Al-Muzini denied recent reports that the deal to release Shalit was very close. "It is true a good progress has been made but this achievement is still limited and the swap is still in its

early phase."

He also denied that Hamas has handed lists of the prisoners it wished to get them released. "There is still long time before this

phase is reached," added al-Muzini.

Declining to specify a time limit for the swap, al-Muzini accused Israel of trying to get advantage of time and end the issue without losses.

Mentioning a Hamas delegation in Cairo, Al-Muzini said that the talks between Hamas and Egyptian officials focused on the soldier' s issue, forming a Palestinian national unity government and ending international siege on the Hamas-led administration.
