One week after their victories in the midterm elections, U.S. Senate Democrats elected their leadership for the 110th Congress that convenes early January next year.

Senator Harry Reid, a moderate Democrat from Nevada, was elected unchallenged as U.S. Senate majority leader for the new Congress, to succeed Republican Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, who did not seek a third term in this year's elections.

Speaking to reporters after the election, Reid said Democrats " must do everything we can to move the country forward. We're going to do it in a spirit of bipartisanship."

Reid has served as the Senate minority leader for the past two years, since his predecessor, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, lost his reelection bid in 2004.

Richard Durbin of Illinois was elected as the Senate majority whip, Patty Murray of Washington was elected as party conference secretary, and Charles Schumer remained as chairman of the party's Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Republicans would elect their leadership Senate leadership Wednesday.

On Thursday, Democrats would elect their House leadership, and on Friday, Republicans would select their leadership in House.

Democrats retook control of both chambers of Congress in last week's elections, the first time in 12 years.
