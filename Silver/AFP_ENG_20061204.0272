Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri will visit Afghanistan this week for talks on curbing the Taliban insurgency by holding a traditional gathering of tribal leaders on both sides of the border, the foreign ministry said Monday.

Kasuri's December 7-9 visit was part of regular contact between the two countries, during which he would discuss bilateral relations, the ministry's spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam told reporters.

"Basically he would discuss how to bring about peace and calm in the bordering areas of the two countries," she said at a weekly briefing.

Kasuri would hold follow-up discussions with his Afghan counterpart, Rangeen Dadfar Spanta, on decisions made by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and Afghan President Hamid Karzai during their joint meeting with US President George W. Bush at the White House in September, she said.

They would also discuss the proposal for holding a joint jirga, or gathering or tribal elders, on both sides of the border.

"The focus would be on how to activate this traditional institution to bring down violence and promote peace in the border areas," Aslam said.

Karzai, concerned about the growing insurgency in his country, proposed convening a jirga at the Washington meeting amid tensions between the neighbours, who blamed each other for not doing enough to rein in the militants.

Ethnic Pashtuns living on both sides of the border have for centuries used jirgas to resolve internal disputes.

Kasuri would also discuss the strategy Pakistan was following in its rugged tribal belt, where the government signed a peace deal with pro-Taliban militants in September to curb violence.

"We hope that something on similar lines, a comprehensive strategy, can be developed in Afghanistan," Aslam said.

"If implemented, that (would have) not only a political dimension -- national reconciliation -- but also an economic component for reconstruction."

Pakistan, a key ally in the US-led "war on terror" has deployed 80,000 troops along the frontier to stop militants launching attacks in Afghanistan.
