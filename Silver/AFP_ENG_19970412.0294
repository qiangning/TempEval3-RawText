Eastern Slavonia, the only part of Croatia still in Serb hands, lived through a last day of uncertainty Saturday before a nationwide vote for local councils and Croatia's upper house Sunday, with the turnout seen likely to decide their future.

The vote will be the first in which they can express their wishes at the ballot box since the region was captured by rebel Serbs in 1991 during a war in which the rebels captured almost one third of the country.

Croatian government troops retook all the land they held except Eastern Slavonia in 1995 and the elections will be a major step before their last stronghold is turned over to Zagreb.

Within the region, the polls are being organised by the UN administration which has run Eastern Slavonia since January last year.

Serbs have expressed fears about reprisals for their role in the war and over the expected return of tens of thousands of Croat refugees who were "ethnically cleansed" in 1991.

The Serbs only lifted their threat of a boycott Friday after heavy international pressure and the intervention of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, a longtime supporter of the rebels.

In a last-minute attempt to get people to vote, the Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS), led by Vojislav Stanimirovic, launched into what seemed more like a mobilisation rather than a real political campaign.

"Everything is going too quickly for us but we must all vote if we are to stay here because we have no other place to go to," said Milena, a young Serb refugee.

She was originally from the Croatian town of Glina, south of Zagreb, which the Croatian army retook from the rebels in 1995.

The Serbs are being urged to go to the polls to counteract the vote of about 70,000 Croat refugees now living in other regions of the country and many of them eager to return.

Realising that every Serb vote will count, the media in Eastern Slavonia spent Saturday urging people to go to the polls, even if they had already decided that they did not want to stay under Croatian rule.

"If you have decided to leave, then leave but vote beforehand and give your vote to assure the future of the young," read one of the slogans.

International officials have expressed fears that up to 20,000 Serbs could go.

The hesitation shown by their leadership has contributed to the Serbs' confusion, who feel betrayed by Milosevic, the architect of the dream of a "Greater Serbia" -- a state where all Serbs would live.

Last Sunday, the Serbs voted in a referendum in which they overwhelmingly called for their territory to be one unit, in defiance of the Croat electoral boundaries which split the region.

Even before the referendum, their demand had been turned down by Zagreb, Belgrade and the international community.

The same voters will now have to vote to return their territory to Croatian rule.

"I am sorry the decision to take part in the elections was taken so late. The elections are nonetheless an experiment on the 150,000 people in a region where war raged for five years," Stanimirovic said Friday.

Serb officials are still arguing about irregularities in the voting registers but the UN administration has said that the conditions are right for free and fair elections.

On Saturday fierce winds tore at the few electoral posters of the Independent Democratic Serb Party in this desolate and abandoned town, Eastern Slavonia's largest, which was flattened during a bitter three- month siege by the rebels.
