Malaysian share prices dipped 1.1 percent by midday Tuesday, with the market barometer falling below the 1,200 support level for the first time in three months following credit curbs and the Dow's fall.

"The overnight fall on Wall Street was a double whammy for the market, which was already reeling from the central bank's curbs on bank lendings," said Victor Wan, analyst at South Johore Securities.

Wan said investors were selling banking and property stocks in anticipation of lower earnings.

The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's 100-share weighted composite index tumbled 13.68 points to 1,189.42 at the close of the morning session, after touching a low of 1,183.17.

The central Bank Negara Tuesday imposed new lending limits on shares and luxury properties to thwart excessive market speculation and quell soaring property prices.

Bank lending to the property sector was limited to 20 percent of all loans, excluding residential units costing 60,000 US dollars and below, infrastructure facilities and industrial buildings.

Rules for lending against stocks and unit trusts were also redefined.

Trading volume in the morning session was 162.178 million shares worth 1.175 billion ringgit (470 million dollars).

Falling stocks outnumbered those rising 401 to 187, with 142 unchanged and 131 untraded.

Top bank, Maybank, led the fall in banking stocks with a 75 sen lost to 27.50 ringgit, Public Bank was flat at 3.56 ringgit while Arab- Malaysian Merchant Bank declined 70 sen to 19.90 ringgit.

Both national powerhouse Tenaga Nasional and gaming giant Genting eased 10 sen each to 12.00 ringgit and 16.70 ringgit respectively.

Telekom Malaysia shed 20 sen to 19.10 ringgit.
