The UN Security Council on Tuesday capped a special debate on growing Middle East turmoil by reaffirming its commitment to the vision of Israel and an independent Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security.

"The Security Council reaffirms its profound attachment to the vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security," said a statement read by Qatar's Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim al-Thani.

Qatar, which holds the council's rotating presidency for this month, scheduled the debate amid growing concern about the deteriorating situation across the Middle East, with conflicts raging in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon and Iraq.

The 15-member council emphasized that "there can be no military solution to the problems of the region and that negotiation is the only viable way to bring peace and prosperity to peoples throughout the Middle East."

It welcomed last month's Gaza truce agreement reached by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and cautioned that "action by the international community cannot be a substitute for determined measures by the parties themselves."

It again called on the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority to accept the three pinciples set by the Middle East Quartet -- The European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations -- as a basis for resuming peace talks with Israel.

But the Islamist Hamas movement, which controls the Palestinian government since its historic win in the January polls, has so far refused the three principles -- renounce violence, agree to abide by past peace deals or recognise Israel -- even implicitly.

Opening the debate, outgoing UN chief Kofi Annan pleaded for "a new and urgent push for peace" between Israelis and Palestinians.

He reiterated that the Roadmap, the blueprint for peace drawn up by the Quartet, remained "the reference point around which any effort to re-energize a political effort on the Israeli-Palestnian track should be centered."

But US deputy ambassador to the UN Alejandro Wolff warned that "the ultimate responsibility for progress toward peace rests with the parties, and with their fulfillment of the parallel obligations they have agreed to undertake in accordance with the Roadmap."

"The role of the international community, therefore ... must be to help create the environment that will enable the parties to come together to resolve their differences," he added.

In his last report on the Middle East released Monday, Annan also stressed the need to find "new ways of protecting Palestinian and Israeli civilians" from violence, and to establish clear parameters for settling final status issues such as the fate of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees.

Commenting on Annan's ideas, China's UN envoy Wang Guangya said that "they deserve serious consideration" by the Security Council.

Slamming the council for its passivity in tackling the issue, the Chinese ambassador said that the powerful body "should transform itself as soon as possible from 'firefighter' to 'problem shooter,' come up with innovative ideas and take an active and pragmatic approach" to help solve the Israeli-Arab conflict.

Britain's UN Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry again urged Israel "to freeze all settlement activity, including the 'natural growth' of existing settlements, and to dismantle all outposts built since 2001 in line with the provisions of the Roadmap."

And he pressed the Palestinian Authority to make every effort "to prevent terrorism."

Israel's UN deputy representative Daniel Carmon, for his part, stressed that "direct negotiations ... is the only way forward."

"Israelis, Lebanese, and Palestinians all deserve better ... We must join hands in fighting extremism and radicalism, incitement and intolerance, terrorism and hate," he added.
