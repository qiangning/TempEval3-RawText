Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba is in Singapore for a four-day state visit.

Being a small island with no natural resources, Singapore's most important resource is people and this is an area where it has shared the experience with Namibia, Singaporean President S.R. Nathan on Wednesday said at a state banquet hosted in honor of his counterpart Pohamba.

Singapore has trained 140 Namibian officials in a wide range of areas including civil aviation, productivity management, public administration and urban development to date, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.

Pohamba and his delegation arrived here on Tuesday and met Nathan earlier on Wednesday, the statement said.

He also met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and some of Singapore's cabinet members.
