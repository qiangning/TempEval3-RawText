A strange metre (yard) long fish may have sparked a long-feared resources battle in the wild and rugged Antarctica which for decades has been dismissed as little more than a scientific playground with no global strategic significance.

Toothfish (Dissostichus) was only identified as a rich commercial catch two years ago but in the last couple of months at least 40 large fishing ships mainly from Spain and Norway have headed into the Southern Ocean to take it.

France has sent three warships to its Southern Ocean territory of Kerguelen Island to combat what diplomatic sources here say is "extreme" illegal fishing which is plundering the fish worth between 5,000 and 7,000 US dollars a tonne.

New Zealand Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton warned Tuesday they would be taking action to protect the Ross Dependency in Antarctica from the armada and official sources said the message had gone out to fishing nations that New Zealand defence forces would be watching.

Australia has a profound problem as its polar waters are likely to be the next major target, but the area is at the maximum extreme of its fisheries protection services.

The struggle comes ahead of a 43 nation conference next month in Christchurch on setting up environmental controls in the continent and re-defining the 1961 Antarctic Treaty which covers the area south of 60 degrees South latitude.

The treaty, originally signed by 12 countries, demilitarised Antarctica, promoted scientific research and suspended the territorial claims over the region by Australia, Argentina, Chile, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Forty three countries have now signed the treaty.

In the early 1980s Malaysia launched an assault on the treaty system and called for Antarctica to be transferred to United Nations jurisdiction.

A Victoria University's Centre for Strategic Studies paper published last month said the treaty would be always prone to challenge as it was based on a remarkable assumption -- that a small group of countries could unilaterally set in place a system of governance for such a vast continent.

The paper was written by Stuart Prior, head of the government's Antarctic Policy Unit.

"While the treaty is open to signature by any state, the treaty parties must acknowledge that the basis of the treaty regime is still not wholly accepted internationally," he wrote.

Any military protection of the region is handicapped by the vast distances involved and influenced by the role of the gateway countries, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa.

The United States Navy has played a key role in the continent from a base in Christchurch. But Washington, for budget reasons, has said the US Navy will withdraw by 2000.

The oceans around the continent are protected by the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) which is an annex of the treaty. But conflicting international rules, including the Law of the Sea, mean CCAMLR's role is difficult.

"The jurisdictional regime applying in Antarctic matters is complex," Prior wrote. "Enforcement relies solely upon member states."

Countries which have signed the treaty agree to higher standards than the Law of the Sea, but those who have not signed can regard polar waters as high seas and thus fish without controls.

The UN Straddling Stocks rules might apply but scientists do not know yet whether toothfish is a migratory species covered by the new convention.

Not much at all is known of the fish, first named five years ago as the "Patagonian toothfish".

It is a long fish with a large mouth and is believed to be bottom dwelling, living off cod. It lives for up to 25 years.

Upton said Tuesday that at least 40 ships re-flagged to countries including Vanuatu had in the last couple of months taken 30,000 tonnes of toothfish. Diplomatic sources here say the sudden emergence of so much fish on world markets had depressed prices in the short term and much of the catch has been stockpiled.

But the rewards are apparently so great that New Zealand will legally, under CCAMLR regulations, send a fishing expedition into the Ross Dependency next month -- the height of the polar winter.

Fishermen have occasionally pulled up toothfish and regarded them as an oddity. But recently declassified United States satellite photos have revealed Southern Ocean bathometry. To the trained eye the photos show where fish are likely to be and thus European boats, struggling in the face of the collapse of North Atlantic fishing, have gone south in a new gold rush.
