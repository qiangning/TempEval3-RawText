Despite another failure with the bat as he continues his comeback, Michael Vaughan is expected to return to England's one-day squad later this week and may regain the captaincy.

In his fourth match since knee surgery, Vaughan was dismissed for 14 here Tuesday playing for the England Academy, just hours after England coach Duncan Fletcher had given his rehabilitation a glowing endorsement.

Vaughan had made a duck and nine in his two previous appearances for the England Academy here over the last fortnight, and did not bat in the two-day game England played against WA.

There were mitigating circumstances for Tuesday's failure, as the ball was seaming about prodigiously in overcast and muggy conditions ideal for swing bowling.

Vaughan lasted 32 balls and showed signs of his form returning with a couple of elegant boundaries, before again falling to a mistimed pull shot that was skied to mid-on, as he had done in his previous innings.

Despite his indifferent form, the 2005 Ashes skipper is expected to be recalled when England announces its squad for the triangular one-day series, starting in mid-January, later this week.

Fletcher again ruled out Vaughan playing in the last two Ashes Tests and said the selectors were yet to make a final decision on the form and fitness of the former skipper with regards to a one-day recall.

However, the tone of Fletcher's response suggested the 32-year-old was very much on target to play in the triangular series.

"It is very positive and it is pleasing to see," he said.

"Vaughan has been training with (fitness trainer) Nigel Stockill and he is moving around very freely.

"In fact, he says he hasn't felt so good for some time."

Fletcher confirmed Vaughan was being considered as captain for the one-dayers.

"We'll have to make that decision when we meet with the other selectors," he said.

"The (players) have been happy with (Andrew) Flintoff, we will have to take that into consideration when we pick the one-day side."

Flintoff had said he hoped to remain captain for the one-day series on Monday, just after the third Test loss to Australia.

"If the job is available, of course I will," Flintoff said when asked if he would make himself available to captain in the one-dayers.

Vaughan has not played at the top level for England since the third Test against Pakistan in Lahore 13 months ago.

He has a modest one-day record and his last limited overs appearance for England was against Australia in July last year.

Pace bowler Steve Harmison is likely to return home after the Tests, along with spinner Monty Panesar and wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, while batsman Mike Yardy and pace bowler Stuart Broad will be in the selection mix.

All-rounder Jamie Dalrymple, called into the Test squad following the departure of spinner Ashley Giles and a chance to play in the last two Tests, is likely to be part of the one-day outfit and provide the spin option.
