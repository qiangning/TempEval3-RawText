Italy's weekend municipal elections were a shot in the arm for the Refounded Communists, whose support is crucial to the survival of the centre-left coalition which governs the country.

The particularly strong showing by the Refounded Communist party emboldened its leader Fausto Bertinotti to serve notice that it wants a more prominent role in the country's political life.

The Marxist party's performance in the polls, in which one-fifth of the electorate voted in around 1,000 municipalities, made it "unthinkable" to ignore "a political force that is winning support from a growing proportion of the voters," Bertinotti told reporters.

He promptly suggested "a formal government agreement on a programme (of action) between the Refounded Communist and the parties of the current government coalition," which is dominated by the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), itself formerly communist.

The daily La Stampa commented that the Marxists had a "spectacular ability to lead the dance," but warned that their victory "could complicate the task of the government," adding that the ruling coalition would be forced to lean further to the left.

The Corriere Della Sera daily described the situation as a "serious problem" for Prime Minister Romano Prodi and PDS leader Massimo D'Alema.

Undaunted, D'Alema on Monday said he would go ahead with institutional reforms necessary for Italy's membership in the single European currency, despite the Communists' opposition to social spending cuts.

"The government should make its decision in accordance with the general interests of the country and not the Refounded Communists," he said.

The centre-left coalition's dependence on the Communists' support in the lower house was amply demonstrated early this month when their opposition to the deployment of Italian troops in Albania nearly brought down the government.

The big loser in the municipal polls was the Northern League, which has paid for its secessionist aspirations with Milan's city hall, whose mayor was voted out Sunday.

The League's Marco Formentini came in third behind two business leaders, Gabriele Albertini for the right, with 40.2 percent of the vote, and Aldo Fumagalli for the left, who garnered 27.4 percent.

At least Formentini won enough support -- 20 percent -- to swing the second round, scheduled for May 11.

The PDS announced in Rome that talks were taking place between centre- left parties and the communists to reach an accord on presenting a single candidate, with the less well-placed candidate standing down, against centre-right candidates in the second round of elections scheduled to take place on May 11.

Party official Marco Menitti said the logic of the second round was "to enlarge the alliance so as to reach a different result from the first round."

The Northern League's decline became irreversible last September, when party leader Umberto Bossi solemnly proclaimed the independence of Padania, the League's name for the northern region.

The celebration on the banks of the River Po was a fiasco, failing to attract the huge crowds that Bossi had predicted.

In Turin, the hub of Italy's automobile industry, outgoing Olive Tree Mayor Valentino Castellani is hoping for a better showing in the runoff, after being forced into second place by right-wing candidate Raffaele Costa. Costa took around 43.5 percent of the vote to Castellani's 34 percent.

In Trieste, centre-left Mayor Ricardo Illy came in well in front with 38 percent of the vote, but will face one of two centre-right candidates who each took about 21.7 percent in the second round.

Elsewhere, the left won the central cities of Siena and Ravenna outright, as well as the northern town of Belluno.
