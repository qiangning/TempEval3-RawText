The Danish minister of foreign affairs promises an aid package to help Palestinians carry out their January parliamentary election, Ritzau news bureau reported on Monday.

Aid for the upcoming Palestinian election was on the agenda when Minister of Foreign Affairs Per Stig Moeller met with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Ramallah on the West Bank on Sunday.

In addition to approximately 600,000 euros in aid to the independent election commission, Moeller promised that Denmark would send election observers and offer assistance to the media.

Assisting the fledgling Palestinian democracy was the goal of the program, according to Moeller, which would also encourage women to exercise their democratic rights.

"The goal is that the Palestinian people get a democracy, that includes a president and only one army, but several political parties," said Moeller.
