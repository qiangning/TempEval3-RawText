HONG KONG, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Hang Seng index Tuesday slipped 2.94 percent, the largest single-day drop since the "9.11" attack in 2001, dampening the market's enthusiasm promoted by the bull trend for over one month.

Dragged by the falling down of Asian markets and Wall Street, Hang Seng index dived 564.48 points to close at 18,639, with a turnover of 58.9 billion HK dollars (7.59 U.S. dollars). The index of H-shares fell 380 points to close at 8,133 due to the selling pressure on financial stocks.

Hang Seng Index opened 207 points lower in the morning session at 18.996, lost its position above 19,000 bench mark. H-shares followed the trend by starting 143 points lower at 8,370 and continued falling down until the end of the trading.

Chinese financial stocks, which took the lead of going up, sunk the most, with financial index of H-shares declining 207 points, or 2 percent, wiping out the previous gains in one session.

Even the successful land auction by the Hong Kong government Tuesday can not suspend the going down of the stock market. One of the land was sold at a price of 75 percent higher than the base price but only sees the stocks of real estate falling down at larger pace.

Cheung Kong, the property giant of Hong Kong's tycoon Li Ka-shing, fell 5.08 percent after the company gained one of the auctioned land. However, Li said he believed the successful land auction Tuesday reflects the property industry's confidence in Hong Kong's economy.

Financial analyst Lee Wei-shing said though the plummeted markets in Asia and the United States are part of the reason for the fall of Hong Kong stocks, the selling of hedge funds is considered the main factor enlarging the scope of decline.

He believed the market needs a consolidation after a bull run of 4,200 points up, starting from 15,205 in June. Lee said the property stocks did not take the advantage of land auction because the auction's price is much higher than the market's expectation.

Co-director of Friedmann Pacific Investment Holdings Limited Haung De-ji said a series of fresh stocks to be listed in next two weeks, which draw a large part of the capital from the market, speeded up the falling.

However, he believed the market will rebound after a period of consolidation due to the healthy development of both Hong Kong and Chinese Mainland's economy in the long run.
