Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders on Thursday called on Turkmenistan to free journalists and political prisoners from the country's jails after the death of president Saparmurat Niyazov.

The authoritarian Turkmen president's death "revives the hope of a liberalization of the country", Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in a statement.

"RSF calls on Turkmen transitional authorities to free journalists and political prisoners without delay."

In its 2006 world press freedom rankings, RSF placed Turkmenistan in 167th place out of 168, just behind North Korea.
