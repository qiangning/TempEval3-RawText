Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said Wednesday he was prepared to meet his Greek Cypriot counterpart, Glafcos Clerides, to try and forge a solution to the Cyprus question, but warned he would not let his community be "colonised" by the Greek majority.

Speaking to journalists after talks with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Denktash said he was optimistic about UN plans to try and get the leaders of the feuding communities on the divided island together for a June meeting.

But he stressed that his base position going into any talks would rule out any notion of Greek supremacy over the Turkish-held north of the Mediterranean island.

"I have been inviting Mr. Clerides to come to the negotiating table and to discuss a bizonal, bicommunal federation resting on the partnership of two politically equal communities (...) and they have been running away from it all this time," Denktash said.

"He (Clerides) has attempted to change the agenda by making a unilateral application to the EU, and pretending that this application is an application by Cyprus, when it is an application by Greek Cypriots only. So naturally we cannot accept that kind of tactics," the Turkish Cypriot leader said.

Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded the northern third of the island in 1974 after a military coup in Nicosia aimed at uniting the island with Greece.

Denktash's breakaway Turkish-Cypriot northern state declared in 1983 is recognized only by Ankara.
