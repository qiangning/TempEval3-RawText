DOHA, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- History was made in 2004 when the six-member Afghanistan team entered the Athens Olympic Games. Two years later, Afghanistan is eager to earn prestige from the sports world in Doha Asian Games.

"After being a long time away from the sports family, now we are entering the family again," Din Mohammad Safi, the Chef de Mission, told Xinhua.

The flag-raising ceremony for Afghanistan delegation was held in the Athletes' Village on Monday.

"We lost some prestige during the war. We came back here to earn the prestige of the sports world. And we want to find what we lost in the past," he said after the ceremony.

The south Asian country Afghanistan, with a population of 26 million, could not achieve so much success in the international sports due to its political unsettle and wars within the country.

Roia Zamani won bronze for Afghanistan in the women's 72kg taekwondo at the 2002 Busan Asian Games.

"Afghanistan TV stations also came to Doha to broadcast the competitions, and the Afghan people are quite enthusiastic with the Asian Games," Safi said.

"Winning or losing is not important for our delegation. We want to learn from the Asian Games, and be a part of the sports family. "

It has a long tradition of sports as Afghanistan first competed in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. Its best result came from wrestler Mohammed Ebrahimis who finished fifth at Tokyo Olympiard in 1964.

In the Athens Games, Afghanistan sent women for the first time in the 100m track event and judo but did not win any medal.

For a country devastated by the wars, Afghanistan needs the helping hands from the sports family.

"Our young people need the sports to change their life and we have asked for help from some sports federations."

"China is the sports powerhouse in Asia, and we have contacted our embassy in Doha, hoping China to send some coaches to our country," Safi said.
