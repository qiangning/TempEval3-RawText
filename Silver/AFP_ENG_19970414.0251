Jailed politician Bernard Tapie left prison Monday after a judge granted his request for day-release custody, 10 weeks after he was jailed over a football match-rigging scandal.

Tapie, who was jailed for eight months in February, is expected to resume working during the day after granted the part-time regime under regulations which allows such leniency for first-time offenders jailed for under a year.

On Monday he was released from the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence to be transferred by prison van to the day-release prison at Baumettes in Marseilles, an AFP correspondent said.

Tapie is expected to work for an old Marseilles business colleague, Michel Bigoin, as a representative for his shipbuilding and defence group SECNA. No contract has yet been signed, but Bigoin said Tapie will "be trying to renew links with potential clients."

Under the terms of his custody, he will have to return to the Baumettes prison by 7:00 p.m. every evening.

The day-release regime will be suspended from May 12-30 during a trial involving Tapie's role in illegal funding of his former footbal club Olympique de Marseille (OM).

Tapie, a former French MP and Euro-deputy, has faced a string of legal actions in recent years which have reduced him from a succesful businessman-turned-politician to a prison inmate.
