A four-day conference for young political leaders in Asia and Europe concluded here Thursday with the adoption of a joint statement featuring agreements on youth issues in the two continents.

The conference, jointly-hosted by the All China Youth Federation and Asia Europe Foundation, was aimed at implementing the proposals from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao at the fifth Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM).

It was also the first of such activities among young political leaders in the history of the ASEM.

More than 100 young delegates from 34 countries and regional youth organizations attended the conference which started in Beijing on Monday and then moved to the neighboring port city of Tianjin.
