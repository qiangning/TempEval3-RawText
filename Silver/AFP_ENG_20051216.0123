Toyota said Friday it had withdrawn from the Indy Racing League (IRL), one year earlier than initially planned.

Toyota had planned to pull out of the US-based open wheel racing series after the 2006 season but decided to advance the withdrawal by one year with a Toyota engine-powered team switching to another company.

The pullout follows General Motors' decision last November to withdraw Chevrolet from the IRL after the 2005 season and leaves Honda as the lone enginemaker in the series next season.

Honda and Toyota withdrew from IRL's rival, Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), in 2002. It now runs as Champ-car and has only Cosworth engines.

Toyota's 2003 IRL debut brought immediate success as Scott Dixon of New Zealand won the first race in Miami and captured the season crown while Toyota-powered Brazilian Gil de Ferran won the Indianapolis 500.

Chevy did not win an IRL race or pole in 2004, leaving Toyota in an uphill battle with Honda which has outspent its rivals in development.

Honda-powered cars won 14 of 16 races last year with Toyota racers taking only the first and last races of the season.

Toyota-powered cars have won twice this season, American Sam Hornish in March and his Penske Racing teammate Castroneves last Saturday at Richmond, Virginia. But Penske's cars have been the only competitive Toyotas in 2005.
