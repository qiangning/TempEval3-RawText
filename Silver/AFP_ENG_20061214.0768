Oil prices were steady in Asian trade Friday after sharp overnight gains on news the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would cut output further to shore up the market, dealers said.

At 10:15 am (0215 GMT), New York's main contract, light sweet crude for January delivery, was up four cents to 62.55 US dollars a barrel from New York trade where it had risen 1.14 dollars to 62.51 dollars on the OPEC lead.

Brent North Sea crude for January delivery was steady at 62.12 dollars.

OPEC's decision to cut output by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from February showed the oil cartel's resolve to maintain crude prices at 60 dollars and above, dealers said.

"The indication from OPEC is they are determined to defend the 60-dollar price level," said Victor Shum, an analyst with energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz.

OPEC ministers meeting in Nigeria on Thursday announced the latest round of production cuts which follows a reduction of 1.2 million bpd from November onwards.

"The market reacted bullishly to OPEC's decision," said Phil Flynn at Alaron Trading. "Some people doubted that it would take the decision and OPEC proved that it is very serious in keeping prices in control."

Flynn said that the decision to start the cuts in February "eased some concerns about cutting into the bulk of winter."

The announcement of a second cut in two months followed warnings that a further reduction could spark sharply higher prices in the coming months, the peak time for oil demand during the northern hemisphere winter.

"The key point for us is the risk for OPEC to over-tighten the market," Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish said.

"Oil inventories have eroded substantially over the past few weeks, especially in the US, and in a market going through such a rapid degree of tightening we do not think OPEC should have cut so much."

The US Department of Energy in its latest report said crude oil reserves fell 4.3 million barrels to 335.4 million in the week ended December 8, much more than the decline of 1.3 million barrels expected.
