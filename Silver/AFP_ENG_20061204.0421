Guido Buchwald, who has just guided Urawa Reds to their first J-League championship title, said Monday he would leave the club at the end of the season and return to Germany, Kyodo News reported.

Urawa offered Buchwald a new contract, but the 45-year-old turned it down because he wants to spend more time with his family in Germany.

"Private commitments have played a part in this decision but also I feel that I have achieved all I can over three years at one club," Buchwald said.

"This has been a very difficult decision for me to make. I have been working with a team I enjoy working with and delivered results, so it hurts to be leaving."

When asked if he plans to work with Jurgen Klinsmann, Germany's World Cup coach and his close friend, Buchwald said: "We have been close friends since childhood and have a great understanding but we have not talked about working together."

Buchwald, a member of West Germany's World Cup-winning squad in 1990, played for Urawa from 1994-1997 and became their manager in 2004, when he led the team to the J-League second-stage title and the final of the league cup.

Urawa beat defending champions Gamba Osaka 3-2 on Saturday to secure the league crown.
