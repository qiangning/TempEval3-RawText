Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri canceled a planned visit to Alberta on doctor's advice to rest in Ottawa, the Canadian foreign ministry said Saturday.

Hariri was to have traveled to Edmonton Saturday for a meeting with the provincial premier, Ralph Klein, and other meetings with business leaders.

Canadian officials said Hariri had a hectic schedule following his arrival here Thursday directly from Moscow.

The Lebanese prime minister will resume his normal activities Sunday, flying to Montreal for talks on economic cooperation and meetings with members of the Lebanese community, officials said.

He is to leave Monday for Lebanon.

Al-Hariri is the first Lebanese prime minister ever to visit Canada while in office.
