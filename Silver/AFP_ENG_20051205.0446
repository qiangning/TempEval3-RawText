At least one person was killed and two injured in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Monday when a powerful earthquake hit eastern and central Africa, a hospital source said.

The victim, an infant, died of injuries sustained when the quake caused the collapse of his family's house on the outskirts of the town of Kalemie, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the epicenter of the quake, the source told AFP.

"The infant had been seriously wounded by the collapse and died of his injuries," said the source at the Asia clinic in Kalemie.

Earlier, Michel Bonnardeaux, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Kinshasa, said at least three people, including the infant, had been hurt.

"Two houses and a church collapsed on periphery of Kalemie and in the center, where there was a lot of panic, there are cracks in many buildings," he told AFP, citing UN officials in the area.

An AFP correspondent quoted eyewitnesses as saying several Kalemie residents had been injured and a number of buildings damaged in the town, when the quake that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale occurred.

Residents of six east and central African nations reported feeling the tremors.
