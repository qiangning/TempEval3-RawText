A French Mirage 2000-D warplane used a laser-guided bomb against Taliban units in the south of Afghanistan on Oct. 30, the defense ministry in Paris said on Thursday.

The Mirage's action was part of the Serpentaire air support mission, and the target on the ground was designated by U.S. and British troops engaged with Taliban fighters, the ministry said.

In the past four months, French aircraft have opened fire eight times in Afghanistan, it said.

They are part of France's contribution to Operation "Enduring Freedom" and support for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.
