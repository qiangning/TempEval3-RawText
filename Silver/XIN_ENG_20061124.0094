A member of the Abu Sayyaf Group was killed while his brother, who is also linked to the terrorist group, was arrested in two separate operations by Philippine authorities on Thursday night, the police said on Friday.

A report by Western Mindanao police office head Chief Supt. Jaime Caringal identified the killed Abu Sayyaf man as Joselito Nazara, alias Abu Sufian or Kirrs, while the arrested brother of Nazara was Jayrold, alias Kobe.

Caringal said operatives of the Regional Intelligence and Investigation Division swooped down at the village of Ayala in Zamboanga City to serve an arrest warrant against a group of terrorists.

The Abu Sayyaf members resisted arrest and resulted in a brief gunfight and the killing of Joselito Nazara, said Caringal.

Jayrold Nazara was arrested by the same operatives in a follow- up operation at an Abu Sayyaf safe house at the village of Pamucutan, also in Zamboanga City, the officer said, adding that Jayrold Naraza did not resist arrest.

Also seized in the Pamucutan operation were ammunition and group documents, SIM cards, and several pieces of the police's Special Action Force camouflage uniform, according to the police report.
