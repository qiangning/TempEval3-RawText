The Indonesian rescue team Monday evacuated the bodies of all 12 passengers and crews of a plane that crashed Friday in the most remote province of Papua.

Two helicopters were sent to support the evacuation, which was delayed for two days due to bad weather, police said from the scene.

"The weather is perfect today, no wind no fog. The evacuated process was completed in just two hours," Papua police spokesman Sen. Commr. Kartono was quoted by the Detikcom news website as saying.

The Twin Otter plane belonging to the Trigana Air Service was reported missing Friday during a short-distance trip in Puncak Jaya regency, around 3,600 km east of Jakarta.

The plane was found several hours later without any survivors among the nine passengers and three crews.

Most of the passengers were officials of the local government.
