The newly elected Labor Party leader Amir Peretz reiterated his intention Thursday to pull the party out of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's coalition government, local newspaper Haaretz reported.

"We will notify the prime minister that we want to leave. We want to leave... certainly out of a desire to turn the Labor Party into an alternative that intends to take power in the next elections," Peretz said.

"Amir will discuss with the prime minister an agreed date for an election," said Yuli Tamir, a Labor legislator and Peretz supporter.

Analysts believe that Labor's leaving will propel the country into political disarray and raise the likelihood of early general elections set for November 2006.

Israeli trade union chief Amir Peretz was unexpectedly elected new leader of the dovish centre-left Labor Party in an election on Wednesday, defeating Vice Premier Shimon Peres who brought Labor in Sharon's cabinet to push for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza which was completed on Sept.12.

Shortly after 6 a.m. local time (0400 GMT), amid cheering from Peretz's supporters, Labor Secretary-General Eitan Cabel announced at the party's headquarters in Tel Aviv that Peretz had won with 42.35 percent of the votes, while Peres was backed by 39.96 percent of voters.
