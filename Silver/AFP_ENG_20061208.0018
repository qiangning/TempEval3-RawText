Israel's reputed nuclear arms arsenal has provoked an atomic weapons race in the Middle East, a senior Saudi official said Friday in apparent reference to Iran.

"The fact that Israel has nuclear arms constitutes the most dangerous strategic threat for the security of the Gulf in the short and medium terms," said the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz.

"This has led certain countries in the region to take part in the contest for nuclear arms, as we are now seeing," he said in a speech to a Gulf security conference in Manama, without naming Iran.

The West suspects the Islamic republic is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, a charge denied by Tehran.

The Jewish state is widely considered to be the Middle East's sole nuclear armed power, but has never confirmed or denied the suspicions, and continues to campaign against arch-foe Iran's nuclear programme.
