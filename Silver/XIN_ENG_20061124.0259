The United Nations on Friday has urged the world to mobilize financial assistance to pay for the clean up and rehabilitation of contaminated sites in Cote D'Ivoire as a result of fresh reports that the final costs of a dumping incident in August could reach into the millions of dollars.

The UN Environment Program (UNEP) Executive Director Steiner said in a statement issued in Nairobi that he had been informed by the Ivorian authorities that following initial emergency assistance, the country was now having to use its own public funds to pay a private company for the retrieval, shipment and processing of the toxic waste in France.

"Irrespective of who will or who will not be held liable for this incident, it is the people of one of the world's poorest countries who have already paid dearly for this irresponsible act of hazardous waste dumping, who are now being forced to actually pay the bill for removal and clean up operations," said Steiner.

The costs of this operation allied to the medium and long-term rehabilitation of affected sites could approach 30 million US dollars according to the Ivorian authorities.

Steiner said urgent assistance to meet Cote D'Ivoire costs was in the spotlight but emphasized that this was by no means a unique case.

He warned that cases like this could escalate unless existing international regulations on toxic wastes, including those under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), are properly enforced and gaps between various treaties closed.

"We must assist Cote D'Ivoire now, but it cannot end there. We must enforce existing laws in both OECD and developing countries alongside building the capacity for customs authorities and local waste management at ports and elsewhere to minimize the chances of such an incident occurring in the future," said Steiner.

"It would seem reasonable and sensible to considerably boost the resources of the emergency fund so that the international community can have a specific and well-funded response to hazardous waste dumping incidents that are occurring in Africa and other developing countries far too often," UNEP chief added.

He was speaking on the eve of an international meeting of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which begins in Nairobi next week.

The central theme of the meeting is the issue of electronic waste or e-waste as a result of the massive growth in the international traffic of obsolete products like computers and mobile phones.

But the issue of illegal shipments of hazardous materials to vulnerable countries by unscrupulous operators is also likely to be high on delegates' minds as a result of the Cote D'Ivoire case in which a ship sailing from Europe dumped wastes in the West African country.

Delegates from across the world are arriving in Nairobi for the next week's five-day-long Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention, which was set up to deal with the issue of hazardous waste shipments.
