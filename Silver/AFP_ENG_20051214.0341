England lived up to their top billing and favourites tag by defeating Egypt 2-0 in the final to lift the World Team squash title here on Wednesday.

Led by world number two James Willstrop and former world number one Peter Nicol, they annihilated the Egyptians who despite having the services of reigning world champion Amr Shabana failed to pose any challenge.

England, who won the team titles in 1995 and 1997, were pre-tournament favourites and compensated for their semi-finals loss against France in the last championship held in Vienna, Austria in 2003.

"It is a fantastic win and something to cherish about. It will further help lift the sport back home," said Nicol.

England were given a flying start by Willstrop who overcame the first game loss to defeat Shabana 4-9, 9-6, 9-3, 9-1 in 57 minutes.

Nicol, a former world and British open champion brushed aside Mohammad Abbas 9-0, 9-2, 9-1 in under half-an-hour to give England an unassailable 2-0 lead.

Egypt, whose only title came in 1999, conceded without playing the third match of the tie.

Number three seeds France had the consolation of third place after seeing off a tough challenge from Canada and winning in the end 2-1.

World number one Thierry Lincou of France upstaged Jonathon Power of Canada 9-4, 9-2, 9-2 to give France a 1-0 lead, but Canadian Shahier Razik upset Renan Lavigne of France 9-7, 7-9, 9-7, 6-9, 9-3 to draw level.

World number eleven Gregory Gaultier sealed the tie for France by beating Graham Ryding of Canada 9-2, 9-4, 9-1.

Defending champions Australia, upset by Canada in the quarter-finals, finished fifth by defeating Malaysia 2-0. Malaysia finished sixth.

Hosts Pakistan, winners on six occasions, downed Wales 2-1 to finish seventh.

Wales finished eighth, South Africa ninth and Germany were 10th in the 22-nation event.
