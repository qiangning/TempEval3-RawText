The main US stock indexes posted solid gains in Monday morning trading after The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial announced a 16.5 billion-dollar merger.

At 1657 GMT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 65.61 points (0.54 percent) to 12,259.74 while the Nasdaq composite was 31.69 points (1.31 percent) higher at 2,444.90.

The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index had gained 8.68 points (0.62 percent) to 1,405.39.

"With market participants focused on the prospect of a slowing economy, upcoming economic releases will be front-and-center, especially Friday's November employment report," said AG Edwards analyst Al Goldman.

"Today, negative news on Pfizer will weigh on the market but will be partially off set by merger developments," Goldman said.

The Bank of New York, which was founded in 1784, and Mellon Financial said they had agreed to merge in a bid to create one of the world's largest global asset managers.

The new firm, which will be called The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, will rank among the top 10 global asset managers with over one trillion dollars in assets under management, according to a joint statement from the two banks.

The share prices of both banks soared in morning deals.

The Bank of New York's shares were up 3.51 dollars, or 9.9 percent, at 38.99 dollars while Mellon's stock was up 1.87 dollars, or 4.7 percent, at 41.92 dollars.

Citing the "interests of patient safety," US drug manufacturer Pfizer said over the weekend that it was stopping all clinical trials of the cholesterol-controlling drug Torcetrapib.

The company said Saturday that it was in the process of notifying all clinical investigators and regulatory authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration.

The decision comes after Pfizer officials were informed that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewing a morbidity and mortality study for Torcetrapib recommended terminating the trial "because of an imbalance of mortality and cardiovascular events."

Pfizer is asking all clinical investigators involved in the program to inform patient participants to stop taking the medication immediately.

The drug maker's stock was down 3.19 dollars at 24.67 dollars.

In other stock action, Merrill Lynch was up 1.52 dollars at 88.30 dollars while Bank of America was down 89 cents at 52.61 dollars. Bristol-Myers Squibb was up 30 cents at 25.14 dollars while General Motors was 35 cents higher at 30.04 dollars.

Bond prices weakened. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.440 percent from 4.425 percent Friday while that on the 30-year bond climbed to 4.552 percent against 4.541 percent.

Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
