US Defense Secretary William Cohen flies into Tokyo on Monday straight into a political storm over a government move to force landowners in Okinawa to continue leasing land to US forces.

Protests over the government bill, introduced Friday after the government won the support of the main opposition party, continued Sunday with some 2,500 people braving heavy rain to march in the capital.

Organisers of the rally, which included civic group members, anti-war landowners and other campaigners, said in a statement that they could not "forgive this outrageous act," by the government.

They marched through a nearby shopping district, carrying banners saying "We don't allow US occupation" and "Abolish US bases".

The demonstration followed a rally on Saturday by about 3,000 people in the Okinawan capital of Naha in the southern part of the Japanese archipelago.

The rallies are part of continuing moves to force the US forces off Okinawa where locals have grown increasingly resentful claiming that the use of their land by the military prevents the island from developing economically.

Feelings were raised to boiling point following the rape of a 12-year- old school girl by three US servicemen in 1995.

But Cohen and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto are expected to commit themselves to strong military ties to cope with fears of instability in East Asia, particularly on the Korean peninsula.

During a three-day stop here, Cohen will be assured by Hashimoto that the bill will pass allowing US forces to continue running 12 facilities in Okinawa on land owned by 3,000 people who have refused to renew leases which expire on May 14.

"From the standpoint of ordinary people, it may seem cruel," Hashimoto commented on the decision to extend the leases which he said was necessary to uphold Japan-US defence links. "But it is a question concerning the faith of politicians."

The bill has been opposed by the Social Democratic Party which holds a swing vote in parliament and usually supports the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

The party has instead called for a reduction of US troops in Okinawa.

The demand has been flatly rejected by the US administration, which vows to maintain some 100,000 troops in the Asia-Pacific region due to uncertainty on the Korean peninsula.

Around 27,000 of the 47,000 US troops in Japan are based in Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japan's land area, but accommodates three-quarters of US military facilities in the country.

Hashimoto had hoped to enact the bill before leaving for the United States on April 24 for talks with US President Bill Clinton. The premier said it was "not an appropriate time" to talk about a troops reduction.

When Clinton visited Tokyo a year ago, the two leaders agreed to study the expansion of defence cooperation into "areas surrounding Japan" while they endorsed plans to cut back by 20 percent land used by US forces in Okinawa.

Hashimoto's legislative gamble over Okinawa has shaken Japan's political landscape and could lead to a possible realignment among parties.

On Thursday, Ichiro Ozawa, who heads the main opposition New Frontier Party (NFP), promised to support the bill in parliament. Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the NFP have a combined 385 votes in the 500-seat lower house.

Ozawa, a former LDP strongman, bolted from the scandal-tainted conservative party, helping to end its 38-year grip on power in 1993.

LDP secretary general Koichi Kato said Saturday the LDP would stay aligned with the SDP and the centrist New Party Sakigake in parliament "while seeking to discuss each individual policy with different parties."

On Wednesday, Cohen will fly on to South Korea where he will meet with the commander of the 35,000 US troops there and top Korean leaders to discuss developments in the Stalinist North Korea, hit by worsening food shortages.
