The topic "The Rise of China and Its Global Implications" tops the agenda.

"The commission members want to discuss China's growth directly with Chinese elites from every field," Qin said.

"The rise of China attracts global attention. That's why the commission decided to hold a regional conference in China for the first time, " said Dr. Qin Yaqing, vice president of the China National Association for International Studies.

"The Beijing regional conference is to serve as a platform for China to show its peaceful progress," Qin said, adding that it is also an opportunity to make the country's peaceful rise known to the international community.

The Trilateral Commission was formed in 1973 by private citizens of Japan, European Union countries, United States and Canada to foster closer cooperation among these core democratic industrialized areas of the world and to share leadership responsibilities in the wider international system.
