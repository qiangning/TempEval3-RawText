A 26-year-old Egyptian man died Wednesday from the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the health ministry in Cairo said.

Reda Abdel Halim Farid, from the central Nile Delta region of Zifta, is the tenth person to have died in Egypt after contracting the deadly strain, the ministry said.

H5N1 was first diagnosed in birds in Egypt in February, and the first case in humans was announced on March 18. In its most aggressive form, it has killed more than 150 people worldwide, the World Health Organization has said.
