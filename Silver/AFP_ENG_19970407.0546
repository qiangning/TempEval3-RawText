Notorious criminal Charles Sobhraj, linked to a series of unsolved murders across Asia in the 1970s, was deported from India to France on Tuesday, witnesses said.

The 52-year-old French national, who served 20 years behind bars, left on an Air France flight bound for Paris, escorted by two Indian immigration officials, a witness said.
