Thousands of supporters loyal to a former Bangladesh military ruler went on the rampage Thursday and paralysed two northern cities after a court verdict cost him his election hopes, police said.

Bangladesh's supreme court on Tuesday rejected a plea by Hussain Mohammad Ershad seeking overturn of a two-year jail sentence given by lower court three years ago for squandering government funds.

The verdict ruled out a return to politics for Ershad, as the election commission barred him from contesting in any of the five constituencies he hoped to stand in at the January 22 polls.

Police said supporters of the former dictator chanted "no Ershad, no elections", smashed cars and vans, and ransacked shops in the northern city of Rangpur.

The area is a bastion of support for Ershad, who ruled the country between 1982 and 1990.

"Police dispersed about 1,000 supporters of Ershad's Jatiya Party after they went unruly, smashing chairs at a government office, cars and ransacking shops," police sub-inspector Mohammad Solaiman said.

Hundreds of soldiers and armed police were deployed to quell the violence, he added.

The city of more than 200,000 was at a standstill after the Jatiya Party called a strike in protest at Ershad's disqualification. Offices were closed, schools and roads were empty.

Jatiya Party supporters also disurpted inter-district buses and trains and also enfored a strike in five other neighbouring district towns, police said.

The northeastern city of Sylhet was also brought to a halt after Ershad's supporters held rallies and marches to protest the decision, police official Shahidul Islam said.

Ershad, who leads the country's third biggest party, is a popular figure in Bangladesh and is seen as a potential kingmaker in the elections. He seized power in a bloodless coup in March 1982 but was ousted by a people's revolt in 1990.

Last week he joined an electoral alliance with the main opposition Awami League party.

Bangladeshi law bars any convict from contesting parliamentary elections for five years after completion of a sentence.

Ershad told reporters late Wednesday that his party and its allies, including the main opposition Awami League, may again decide to boycott next month's polls if he is barred from contesting elections.
