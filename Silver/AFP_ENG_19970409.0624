British mercenary boss Tim Spicer, freed in Papua New Guinea on the eve of his trial for illegal firearms possession Tuesday, arrived back in Britain late Wednesday.

"It feels great to be home," said Spicer at London's Heathrow airport, adding he would be holding a press conference Thursday.

Spicer, carrying only hand luggage and a book, was met by a driver in a limousine and was understood to be on his way to a reunion with his wife Catherine and children, Sam, Jessica and Francesca at their home in south London.

The inquiry into the PNG government's hiring of Spicer's Sandline International mercenary group heard allegations Thursday that Spicer was detained by PNG soldiers because he was planning to commit atrocities on the war-torn island of Bougainville.

Brigadier General Jerry Singirok, sacked commander of the PNG Defence Force who made the accusations, sparked a military rebellion last month by demanding the sacking of prime minister Sir Julius Chan for hiring Sandline for 50 million kina (36 million dollars).

The tensions spilled over into several days of unrest on the streets of Port Moresby.

Chan has since stepped aside while a commission of inquiry under Justice Warwick Andrew investigates.
