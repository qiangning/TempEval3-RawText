The European Union (EU) has upgraded its representation level in Sri Lanka to maintain good relations between EU and the Indian Ocean island country, Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday in a press release.

EU's delegation is now a fully-fledged diplomatic mission with an accredited Head of Delegation of ambassadorial rank based in Colombo, said the press release.

With the upgrading, the staff of the EU delegation will be doubled and all operational decisions will be managed locally in Colombo by the expanded team.

EU is a major development partner of Sri Lanka with over 150 million euros in aid to tsunami relief and reconstruction, and over 70 million euros in conventional development expenditure.

EU offers Sri Lanka its most concessional trading status, which assures the country of maximum access for its exports to EU and had made EU one of Sri Lanka's most important trading partners.

EU's new Head of Delegation, Julian Wilson, presented credentials to Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Monday.
