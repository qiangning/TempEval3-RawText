A group of girl students preparing for the Doha Asian Games opening ceremony had to be evacuated when a fire broke out at the Al Bayan primary school on Thursday. No casualties were reported.

Qatar's leading English daily The Peninsula reported that fire was caused by an electrical short circuit while some renovation work was being carried out in the sports hall of the school.

The hall was being prepared to train the students for the Asian Games opening ceremony. It was badly damaged in the fire.

School principal Hissa Abdullah was quoted as saying that all the students were safely evacuated from the building.

The Asian Games is slated to open on Dec. 1.
