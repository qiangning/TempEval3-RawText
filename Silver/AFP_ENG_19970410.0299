India's Congress (I) party Thursday gave the ruling coalition government until Friday to sack Prime Minister H.D. Deve in return for its support in a vote of confidence.

Congress spokesman Ved Prakash said: "We have told the United Front (government) that if it does not come to a viable solution before 11 a.m. (0530 GMT) tomorrow the Congress will vote against it.

"Then the government will fall."

Prakash's comments came after final peace talks between the two sides failed Thursday.

Prakash, however, said a rapprochement could not be ruled out until the last minute.

The Congress last month withdrew its parliamentary backing to the minority centre-left alliance, accusing the government of misrule.

It said Deve Gowda should be sacked and announced it wanted to form its own coalition. Neither group, however, is strong enough to govern without outside backing.

Prakash added: "In politics, you cannot say anything has failed until the very end. There are still lots of possibilities and scope for compromise."
