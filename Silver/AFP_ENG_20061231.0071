French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie on Sunday stressed Paris's support for the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora during a visit to the crisis-wracked nation.

"I have come to reaffirm France's support for the legitimate government of Lebanon," she told reporters after meeting her Lebanese counterpart Elias Murr.

Alliot-Marie also stressed Paris's backing for the Beirut government to "exercise its sovereignty completely", and that the Lebanese army play "a role across all its territory".

Lebanon is undergoing a political crisis with opposition led by Shiite movement Hezbollah seeking to bring down Siniora's government and install a government of national unity.

The French minister, who arrived in Beirut on Saturday for a 48-hour visit, was also to meet Siniora before heading to south Lebanon for New Year's Eve with the French contingent of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

The French UNIFIL troops are stationed 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of the port city of Tyre, at Deir Kifa.

With a 1,600-strong force of "blue helmets", France is the second largest contributor to UNIFIL, beefed up after the UN-brokered truce between Lebanon and Hezbollah took effect on August 14.

France will transfer command of the 11,000-strong force to Italy, the main contributor with 2,300 soldiers, in the coming weeks.
