Global demand for high-technology electronics products should make a moderate recovery in 1997 but the boom years of the early 1990s are unlikely to return, the Philippines-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Thursday.

The ADB's annual Asian Development Outlook report said the upturn would be good news for Asia, whose export success in the sector helped establish "from virtually nothing" the world's newest economic miracles.

"In the short term, Asia's electronics producers will face a demand upturn following inventory adjustment," it said.

"However, growth is likely to be moderate in the absence of new watershed innovations of the magnitude of the compact-disc player or the PC."

This means the industry "is unlikely to return to its pre-1996 boom years, but with continuing growth in the global economy, demand and supply should come into line with each other and the basis for profitable business should be restored."

"New products like digital video discs may spark a renewed boom and the range of uses of electronic components is continually widening, which will make the industry less dependent on the PC," the report said.

The bank said the slump in world electronics trade last year, particularly the sharp decline in semiconductor prices, took their heaviest toll in Asia.

The "biggest losers" were South Korea, Malaysia, where a third of the world's microprocessor production is tested and packaged, Singapore, which makes 40 percent of the world's disk drives, and Taiwan, which makes eight out of 10 circuit boards and half of all keyboards.

The fall was caused by the interplay of a maturing PC market, a shift toward fewer end-product producers and the fast expansion of production capacity, it said.

The second factor means "many input producers now compete to supply standardized products, rendering the market for inputs subject to instability similar to that of primary commodity markets," it added.

The ADB said the growth of the Internet and the resulting demand for faster processors and network access "will support continuing PC sales, even if there is a decline in new customers."

However, it said Intel Corp.'s launch this year of its MMX chip "may mean the market will be left with large quantities of discounted-price Pentium machines."
