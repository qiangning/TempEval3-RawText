World marathon record holder Paul Tergat thinks next year's London Marathon will provide an opportunity for a new world-class battle, local media reported Wednesday.

"I am looking forward to facing a great competition on a fast course. Everybody wants to be there," Tergat was quoted by newspaper Kenya Times as saying.

According to the newspaper, the World Food Program's ambassador against hunger and patron of the IAAF's "Athletes for a Better World" charity project, gave a special press conference in Milan in which he spoke about his dramatic win in the 2005 New York Marathon and his future running career.

The former five-time world cross country champion said he is looking forward to future challenges including the next London Marathon on April 23, 2006 which will feature a rematch with Hendrick Ramaala, and another encounter with Haile Gebrselassie who ran 2:06:20 in Amsterdam on October 16, the fastest time in the year.

The Kenyan marathon star also took a chance to look back at his New York achievement.

In one of the most memorable marathon finishes in history on November 6, he just managed to defeat defending champion Ramaala of South Africa after a breathtaking neck and neck battle which ended with his 2:09:30 victory.

"I am recovering from a grueling race which was really a dramatic and painful experience", said Tergat.

"It was a psychological fight in the final 60 meters. The final five miles run on a hilly course were very tough. The key for my success in the final sprint was my mind which enabled me to beat Ramaala into the finish line. It is from my mind that I found the strength to win this dramatic race. I never lost faith in my capabilities."

"When Hendrick Ramaala and Alberico Di Cecco launched their attacks to break away from the rest of the field I did not follow them but focused on running my own race."

Asked if it was more important for him to set a world record in Berlin or to win in New York, he said: "Berlin was very special for me. It was my first win in the marathon after some defeats in my first attempts over the distance and I broke the world record running 2:04:55."

"In New York, I came back from some hamstring problems after my eighth place in London Marathon, to take the second win of my marathon career at the end of an exciting and thrilling battle. I knew that millions of Kenyans watched me in New York via TV, so this win was very important for them."

Tergat also said he is not thinking yet about retirement. "I want to continue for some years. But at the moment it is unlikely that I will run at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. But I can't rule it out. It depends on my fitness. What motivates me is passion for running. It is not a question of age but of mind which is the key for my success."
