Nigeria is to host a summit on food security in Africa from Dec. 4 to 7 to assess the implementation of resolutions on food security taken in the past, the official News Agency of Nigeria reported on Tuesday.

Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Malam Adamu Bello was quoted as saying that forthcoming summit was "a follow-up action aimed at assessing the level of implementation of such past resolutions."

According to him, all member countries will be expected to present an update on the implementations of the recommendations of the African Union 2003 Maputo Declaration on food security in Africa.

Bello said "issues about availability, accessibility and affordability of food would feature prominently at the summit."

It will also review national programs and projects that are making significant progress in contributing to the attainment of national food and nutrition security, the minister added.

In 2003, African heads of state and government committed their governments in the Maputo Declaration to allocating at least 10 percent of their national budgets for agriculture and rural development within five years.
