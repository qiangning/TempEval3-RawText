The chemical plant blasts which left five workers dead and one missing on Sunday in Jilin Province were caused by the incorrect operation by a worker, said investigators on Thursday.

After a five-day probe, experts agreed that the operator forgot to close the valve of the raw material providing system, leaving the temperature much higher than the normal standard.

The longtime overheating then led to a blowout and the cold air went into the T101 aniline processing tower, which was run under negative pressure and triggered the blast at about 1:45 p.m., and other blasts happened afterwards.

The blasts also left more than 60 injured, 23 of who are still in hospital but in safe condition.
