Claus Jensen's deflected second-half strike awarded Fulham a 1-0 victory over visiting Everton in the English Premiership on Saturday.

The sole goal of the game came in the 65th minute when Jensen's angled shot from 20 yards flew off Tim Cahill and beyond Everton keeper Tim Howard.

It completed the transformation of a game Everton had completely dominated for the first half.

Andrew Johnson missed two good chances and also saw clear penalty appeals ignored when he tumbled under a challenge from Fulham's Ian Pearce.

It continued Everton's miserable sequence of 40 years without a win at Fulham and maintained Chris Coleman's side's steady start to the season.

Everton named an unchanged side after the creditable draw at Arsenal, while Fulham were able to recall captain Luis Boa Morte after he recovered from a fractured cheekbone.

And the Merseysiders controlled the first 45 minutes, with England striker Johnson a central figure.
