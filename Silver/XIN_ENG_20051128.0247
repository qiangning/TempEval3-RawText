Zambian police Monday morning shot dead four suspects after an exchange of gun fire in the capital city of Lusaka. Among the dead are two locals, one Congolese and one Tanzanian.

Lusaka police commanding officer Chendela Musonda told Xinhua that police were tipped off about the four who were trailing a businessman from a bank with large sum of money.

He said the police successfully pined down the men who were driving a Toyota Corolla sedan near a shopping center and exchanged fire with them. Three were shot dead on the spot and the other one escaped with a taxi but was outpaced and gunned down.

No policemen were killed or injured in the incident, said Musonda.

Musonda also said the police recovered a pistol and a rifle used by the bandits together with identification cards which indicated that two are foreigners.

He further said the bandits were suspected to be related with another robbery which occurred last month.

The peaceful southern African country saw mushrooming robbery cases recently with most criminals armed with fire arms. Rumors say some of the criminals are from neighboring countries.

Last Thursday, a Chinese businessman, Chen Xingtao, who was on his way home after closing his store was trailed and robbed of seven million kwacha (about 1,800 US dollars) by a group of armed bandits who were also driving a Corolla car.

The Zambian police stepped up fight with robberies accordingly and Musonda said about 50 suspected criminals of robbery were arrested in the last two months.

He further said criminals who rob with guns, no matter if they have killed victims or not, would be "sentenced to death" according to Zambian laws.
