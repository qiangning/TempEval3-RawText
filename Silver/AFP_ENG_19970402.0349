Iraq appealed again to the UN Security Council Wednesday to lift the sanctions against it, on the eve of a visit here by the head of the UN Special Commission on disarming the country (UNSCOM).

Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahhaf said in a message to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan: "The embargo was imposed and is kept in place to serve US policy goals, not any legal consideration.

"And it goes against international law and the UN charter," the message said, according to Baghdad newspapers.

"Maintaining the sanctions became a policy of vengeance by the known parties to wipe out an entire people and deprive them of their right to life," the message said.

UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus was expected to arrive in Baghdad Thursday. He visits the Iraqi capital on routine missions every two months to monitor the progress of UN inspections and to question the Iraqis on missing arms data.

On March 3 Ekeus accused Iraq of continuing to hide biological weapons and said that doubts about Baghdad's destruction of its medium-range missiles remain.

Under the UN resolutions imposed on Iraq at the end of the 1991 Gulf war, the UNSCOM inspectors must verify that Baghdad has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction before the international embargo against it can be lifted.
