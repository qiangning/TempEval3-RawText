Mali's political parties are hitting the dusty roads in the run-up to Sunday's legislative elections, wooing voters with "victory caravans."

It is an appropriate way to campaign in a desert country more than twice the size of France, and which had 35 years of single-party rule until its first free elections in 1992.

Though it is one of the world's poorest nations, Mali -- home to nine million people -- has recently acquired a reputation as one of Africa's most democratic states.

Thirty-five years of one-party rule ended in 1992 with the election of Alpha Oumar Konare, who is one of 10 registered candidates for presidential elections to be held in May.

Sunday will see the first round of the legislative polls, to be followed by a run-off on April 27. More than 1,500 candidates are in the running nationwide, representing at least 34 of Mali's 62 political parties.

Cars, motorcycles and bicycles make up the various campaign caravans that are criss-crossing northern Mali with loudspeakers blaring the virtues of their respective candidates.

Most evident are the governing Alliance for Democracy in Mali, which took 76 of the 129 seats contested in 1992, and the Bloc for Democracy and African Integration.

"For us, an election is not won with a platform, but with the ability of the parties to mobilize their supporters," one candidate said.

The mood is even livelier than it was five years ago in the north, the stronghold of a long-running Tuareg insurgency that formally ended in 1992.

Wooing voters, candidates are giving away T-shirts and rice. Some village chiefs have found themselves the recipients of motorcycles and sheep.

It is not rare to see in villages the heads of donkeys sacrificed in anticipation of a candidate's victory at the polls.

Merchants are delighted, saying they would not mind an election every month because of the extra business that campaigning has brought to them.

Happy too are the marabouts, the Moslem monks of North Africa, whose advice is regularly sought out by candidates.

In Gao, some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of the capital Bamako, election officials say 289,000 people have registered to cast ballots at 450 polling stations.

Seventy of the polling stations will be mobile, bringing democracy to the voters where they live and work.

"We are ready," said Bakayoko (eds: one name), the chief returning officer in Gao.

To deal with bandits, who are blamed for recent thefts of four-wheel- drive vehicles, a special security unit has been set up to assit the national election commission.

It is tasked with guarding ballot papers, see-through ballot boxes and indelible ink as they are distributed over the countryside.

In far-off places with names like Bourem, Menaka and Djebock, voting will take place "under supervision," officials said.

"The aim is to deter any interference by armed bandits, so that the return of peace is genuine in the north," one official told AFP.
