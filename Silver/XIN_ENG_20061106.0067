Sudanese President Omer Hassan Ahmed El-Bashir arrived Monday at Sanya, a scenic city in China's southernmost Hainan Province, in an effort to facilitate Sudan- China cooperation.

Wei Liucheng, governor of Hainan Province, briefed the president in a meeting on the development of the tropical agriculture, tourism and oceanic oil resources exploration, and expressed his hope to enhance trade and economic cooperation with Sudan.

El-Bashir said China has already been a leading partner of Sudan in foreign trade and petroleum cooperation, but large room still exists for further cooperation.

In another development, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf visited Shenyang, an old industrial base in north China's Liaoning Province, to inspect local industries, especially processing, natural resources, communication and agriculture.

The two presidents attended the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation which closed on Sunday.
