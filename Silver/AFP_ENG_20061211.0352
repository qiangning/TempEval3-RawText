South Africa, which has the world's second heaviest caseload of HIV/AIDS, has seen average life expectancy fall by 13 years since 1990 to 51, a new study has said.

A survey by the Medical Research Council and Actuarial Society of South Africa, based on epidemiological and demographic data, said life expectancy this year was "estimated to be 49 years for males and 53 years for females" or an average of 51.

"By 2005, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has already taken about 13 years off life expectancy," it said.

Senior MRC Researcher Debbie Bradshaw said life expectancy in South Africa was on average 64 years in 1990 and had now dropped to 51.

A mathematical AIDS model was used to determine how much the disease contributed to the decline in population figures.

South Africa is second to India as the country with the highest number of HIV-infected people in the world.

Around 5.5 million people in a population of 47 million are living with HIV or AIDS.

The government has come under fire for delays in rolling out lifesaving antiretroviral drugs.

According to government figures for September, 213,000 infected people now benefit from a government-funded antiretroviral plan, and 11,000 more join each month.

The study said that without the ARV programme "the decrease in life expectancy would be nearly 19 years by 2015, with an average life expectancy of less than 48 years.

Based on a scenario developed by researchers that by 2015 50 percent of those needing treatment will be receiving it, the impact of AIDS deaths could slow down in the coming years.

"With the programme, the difference is expected to reduce below 16 years, giving a life expectancy of 50 years."
