About 80 percent of China's computers have been infected with virus in 2005, 8 percent lower than last year.

This is the first time of drop for the PC virus infection ratio in China over the past five years, said sources with the Eighth International Conference of the Association of Anti Virus Asia Researchers (AVAR) here Friday.

According to a latest survey conducted by the Ministry of Public Securities, China's companies, institutions and government offices have more access to the information technology this year.

They all strengthened the work concerning information network safety and are rewarded with a drop of virus infection ratio, said Zhang Jian, deputy director of the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center.

The survey also said that China is not hit by serious virus so far this year.

According to the analysis of types of computer virus, the worm virus infection ratio is obviously higher than others, accounting for 74 percent.

Zhang said that China still lacks professionals of network safety maintenance.

He urged the governments at all levels to provide more training chances for the related workers and specialists and increase investment for the development of anti-virus technologies and software.
