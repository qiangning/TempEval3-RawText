Chile on Friday rejoined the Andean Community of Nations (CAN) some 30 years after its 1976 exit, although it still remains an associate rather than a full member at the moment.

Chile's foreign minister, Alejandro Foxley, said his country will work hard for regional integration.

The foreign ministers of the CAN nations, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia, agreed on Chile's reentry into the group, at the sidelines of the third foreign ministers' meeting of the Community of South American Nations in Chile's capital Santiago.

A CAN committee will decide in 180 days exactly how Chile will take part in the Andean Integration System's bodies and institutions.

Chile was a founder member of CAN but left it in 1976 following a squabble over foreign investment law provisions.

Venezuela left CAN at the beginning of this year in order to be qualified as a full member of the trading block, Common Market of the South (Mercosur). All CAN members, including Chile, are associate members of Mercosur.
