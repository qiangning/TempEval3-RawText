GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a world famous pharmaceutical company, is building a new research and development (R&D) plant in Singapore with an investment of 115 million Singapore dollars (about 68 million US dollars).

According to Channel NewsAsia report on Friday, the plant, which is expected to begin operation in the third quarter of 2007, will develop techniques for drug production and produce drugs for clinical trials.

Planning to employ some 40 scientists, the plant is said to be "GSK's first investment in upstream manufacturing process development in Singapore."

As one of the largest pharmaceutical investors in Singapore, GSK has put more than one billion Singapore dollars (about 589 million US dollars) in fixed assets in the city state and plans to further expand its operations here, including establishing more drug discovery centers.

Headquartered in Britain and with operations based in the United States, GSK runs seven such drug discovery centers in the world with one located in Singapore.
