Britain's Natural Law Party (NLP), which is putting forward 300 candidates in the May 1 elections, issued its campaign manifesto on Friday with answers to such pressing problems as crime, unemployment and indigestion.

Transcendental meditation and "yogic flying" hold the key to creating "heaven on earth" and a "happy, prosperous and trouble-free country," said the party which in 1992 won 64,000 votes nationwide, but no seats.

By voting NLP candidates for parliament, Britain would obey a natural law based on scientific research, instead of the old, tired policies of the traditional parties right, left and center, said party leader Doctor Geoffrey Clements (PhD, physics).

"Last week the manifestos for the old parties were launched that showed nothing new was being offered. We cannot afford to let this situation continue," Clements told a London press conference simultaneously relayed around the country.

"When we look around at the galaxies and the Earth they are governed by natural law," he said. "But what is absent in this country is that same natural law."

This, said Clements, is the essence of the Natural Law Party: combining the need of the individual and of society through transcendental meditation and yogic flying which, practiced 20 minutes morning and evening, leads to a "bubbling bliss of intense coherence.

"It increases the functioning and intelligence of the mind," he said.

"We are not a superficial party," said deputy leader Peter Warburton. "There is depth in our goals."

Yogic flying is when you sit on the floor in the lotus position, meditate yourself into a lighter and lighter state, then sort of, well, bounce up and down.
