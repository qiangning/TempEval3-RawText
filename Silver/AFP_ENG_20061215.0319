British Prime Minister Tony Blair defended the decision to ditch a fraud inquiry into a weapons deal with Saudi Arabia, insisting here Friday it was vital to protect Britain's national interests.

Blair said the decision was crucial for Britain's relationship with Saudi Arabia, its interests in the Middle East and the counter-terrorism fight, not to mention the British jobs potentially at stake.

Blair said he took "full responsibility" for his advice to Attorney General Lord Peter Goldsmith, who announced Thursday that the investigation into the Al-Yamamah BAE Systems deal from the 1980s was being stopped after two years.

And Blair's official spokesman added that the prime minister made "no apology" for acting in what he saw as the national interest.

The Serious Fraud Office had been probing claims that defence giant BAE established a slush fund for some Saudi royals, which allegedly provided perks including luxury cars to keep them doing business with BAE.

"I think it's a very important issue for our country," Blair said on the sidelines of a summit of European leaders in Brussels.

"Leave aside the effect on thousands of British jobs and billions worth of pounds for British industry.

"Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is vitally important for our country in terms of counter-terrorism, in terms of the broader Middle East, in terms of helping in respect of Israel-Palestine.

"My role as prime minister is to advise on what is in the best national and strategic interest of our country and I've absolutely no doubt at all that the right decision was taken in this regard."

BAE earlier this year agreed to a 10 billion-pound (14.8-billion-euro, 19.8-billion-dollar) deal with Saudi Arabia for 72 Eurofighter jets, and the deal was reportedly under threat due to the investigation.

The "slush fund" was allegedly linked to an estimated 50-billion-pound Al-Yamamah deal involving the supply and support of Tornado and Hawk jets as well as the contruction of an airbase.

Goldsmith said it was unlikely that there would be a successful prosecution even after a further period of investigation, Blair's spokesman stressed.

"Saudi Arabia, given its position in the world, is a very important ally in the fight against terrorism," he added, saying that he was not aware of the issue being raised at the meeting of European leaders.

Blair is about to leave for Turkey at the start of a wider tour to the Middle East, where international efforts to combat terrorism are bound to feature.
