Nine people were arrested here overnight following a fight that erupted between Kurds and Turks in the wake of Tukey's win over Holland in a World Cup qualifying match, police said.

The Turkish victory (1/0) late Wednesday in the Turkish town of Bursa sparked clashes between the two communites, especially in a neighborhood where six members of a Turkish Kurd family died last week in a suspicious fire.

Police said several vehicles were damaged by about a dozen Turks and Kurds.

Fights also erupted in the eastern town of Arnhem.

The incidents came as a Turkish parliamentary delegation was in the Netherlands to assess progress being made by police investigating the March 26 fire that killed a woman and five of her six children.

Dutch Interior Minister Hans Dijkstal was to meet later Thursday with members of the Turkish community to inform them of security measures being taken to protect their neighborhoods.
