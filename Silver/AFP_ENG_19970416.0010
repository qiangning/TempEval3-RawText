MIF Asia Ltd., the financing arm of Japanese trading giant Marubeni Corp., has mandated Nomura Singapore Ltd. to lead-manage its one- billion-US-dollar fund raising program here.

The program allows MIF Asia to issue fixed and floating notes of different maturities -- with different coupon rates -- up to a total of one billion dollars, according to a statement from MIF Asia received here Wednesday.

MIF Asia has received in-principle approval to list the notes issued under the program on the Stock Exchange of Singapore. Subscribers to the notes are expected to be investors, mainly financial institutions and fund managers, from Asia.

The statement said MIF Asia, incorporated in Singapore in 1995 and registered in Hong Kong as an overseas company in the same year, would use the funds raised for its non-Singapore-dollar-denominated financial activities.

Marubeni set up MIF Asia as part of its global financial network to integrate the four major financial markets of Japan, the United States, Europe and Asia.

MIF Asia provides financial services to Marubeni's subsidiaries and affiliates in Asia and conducts investment-related activities such as portfolio investments in Asian money and capital markets.

Apart from Nomura Singapore, there are 14 other dealers for the note program.
