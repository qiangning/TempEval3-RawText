Three men released from Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. navy base in Cuba, have arrived in Albania, a government spokesman said on Monday.

"They have arrived, that is all," Neritan Sejamini told reporters without revealing any other details.

Albania admitted on Saturday that it would take from the U.S. three detainees released from the controversial base which has been used to hold terror suspects.
