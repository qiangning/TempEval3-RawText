At least 13 Palestinians were wounded in the Gaza Strip as supporters of the ruling Hamas movement and the rival Fatah faction traded fire during protests over president Mahmud Abbas's call for early elections, medics and witnesses said.

The clashes followed Abbas's call for early presidential and parliamentary elections as a way to resolve a months-long standoff with the ruling Hamas movement, which has left the Palestinian administration paralyzed and broke.

Hamas has rejected Abbas's call for elections, warning that it amounted to a call for "civil war" and vowed to fight the measure by bringing its supporters into the streets.

Thousands of armed Hamas and Fatah supporters staged competing protests in central Gaza City late Saturday. Demonstrations were also underway in the south and the north of the coastal strip. Several smaller protests were also staged in the occupied West Bank.

"Oh, Abu Mazen, oh spy!" chanted Hamas supporters, some of them masked and carrying the green flags of the Islamist movement and portraits of prime minister Ismail Haniya, in Gaza City. "No, a hundred times not to early elections!"

"Abu Mazen's call is a provocation and a coup d'etat against legitimacy and democracy," a Hamas spokesman, Ismail Radwan, cried to the crowd, referring to Abbas by his widely-used monicker.

"The government is not responsible for the boycott" of the international community, he said.

The West, which considers Hamas a terrorist organization, froze all direct aid to the Palestinian government after the Islamists formed a cabinet in March, and is demanding that the movement recognize Israel, renounce violence and agree to past peace deals for the badly-needed funds to resume.

"We will neither recognize Israel nor the (peace) agreements," Radwan cried. "We demand a return to the negotiations table" to form a government of national unity.

In calling for early elections, Abbas left the door open to forming a coalition government with Hamas and avoiding the polls.

Abbas's call came after a week of rising tensions and violence between his Fatah party and Hamas, and followed the collapse of months-long talks on forming a national unity government.
