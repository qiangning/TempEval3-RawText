The death of veteran ultranationalist opposition leader Alpaslan Turkes will shake up right-wing politics in Turkey, as his party is likely to disintegrate with his demise, political analysts said Saturday.

Turkes, leader of the Nationalist Action Party, a small but influential political group, died here on early Saturday after a heart attack. He was 80.

His party failed to win a single seat in parliament in Turkey's December 1995 general election, as it received only 8.5 percent of the vote, which was short of the required 10 percent national threshold.

Turkes was expected to be replaced by his son, Tugrul, as party chief, according to political analysts.

However, The Istanbul-based liberal daily Hurriyet said Nationalist Action was unlikely to survive without the veteran politician, who was seen by his followers as the "great leader of the Turkish world."

In the likely event of the party's disintegration, its potential votes could be shared by the pro-Islamic Welfare Party of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, the conservative True Path Party of Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, the conservative Motherland Party and the ultra-rightwing Grand Unity Party, it said.

"Turkes had a very important role in Turkey's political life, I deeply regret his demise," President Suleyman Demirel said in a statement.

"Turkes was one the great political leaders in Turkey's recent history, we had been involved in close cooperation," Ciller told reporters.

Turkes was born in Nicosia, Cyprus, in 1917 and graduated from the Military Academy in 1938, joining the army.

Involved in ultranationalist movements since the early 1940s, Turkes was one of the senior organisers of a military coup in 1960, which eventually led to the hanging of toppled conservative prime minister Adnan Menderes.

Turkes was twice deputy prime minister in right-wing coalition governments between 1975 and 1978.

He was imprisoned and barred from active politics after another military coup in 1980, but regained his political rights in a 1987 referendum.

His Nationalist Action supported a centrist coalition between True Path and the left-wing Republican People's Party between 1991 and 1995.

Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, Turkes supported the creation of a union of Turkic countries with the participation of Turkey and the mainly Moslem former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

Turkes was also the virtual leader of the ultranationalist Grey Wolves organisation, whose members were involved in bloody fighting with extreme leftist groups in the late 1970s, prompting the 1980 military coup.

Married with seven children, Turkes was the author of several books promoting Turkish nationalism.

Supporting modern Turkey's pro-secular tradition, Turkes in recent months had criticised efforts by Erbakan's ruling Welfare to introduce Islamic practices in social life.
