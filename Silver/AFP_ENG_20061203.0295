The unrest in Iraq is "much worse" than a civil war, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan told the BBC in an interview to be broadcast Monday.

He said some Iraqis were right to think that they were worse off than under dictator Saddam Hussein, ousted from power after US-led forces invaded in March 2003.

The UN chief voiced his regrets over the invasion, saying it could have been stopped had UN weapons inspectors been given more time to conduct their work, and he added that the wounds had still not healed in the UN.

Turning to Iran, Annan said the UN needed to do whatever it could to resolve the stand-off over Tehran's nuclear programme through negotiations.

And the Ghanaian vowed to make Darfur a priority in his final month in office, even though the international community has neither "the resources or the will" to confront the crisis in the western region of Sudan.

On the sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in Iraq, Annan said: "When we had the strife in Lebanon and other places, we called that a civil war -- this is much worse," he said.

He described Iraq as being in an extremely dangerous situation and raised concerns about the Iraqis' ability to solve these problems by themselves.

But Iraqi President Jalal Talabani on Sunday rejected Annan's idea of an international peace conference on Iraq, apparently leaving the idea dead in the water.

Last Tuesday, Annan had suggested that the international community hold a broad-based peace conference to find a way out of the vicious sectarian struggle that has plunged Iraq into bloodshed.
