Support for the ruling Conservative Party fell in fresh opinion polls to be published, one week ahead of Britain's general election, with three new polls giving the opposition Labour Party as easy winners.

A survey by the polling group MORI for Thursday's Times newspaper showed support for the opposition Labour Party down one to 48 percent, the Conservatives down five to 27 percent and the Liberal Democrats up four to 17 percent. It gave Labour a 21-point lead.

Earlier Wednesday two polls by Gallup -- the first for Channel 4 News and the second for Thursday's Daily Telegraph -- put Labour's lead at 19 percent and 20 percent.

Both Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph put Labour on 50 percent of voting intentions.

The figures suggested that a poll by the group ICM and published by the left-of-centre Guardian newspaper Wednesday, which claimed Labour's lead had fallen to just five percent, could have been a rogue result.

Ironically neither Labour nor Tory officials believe the gap between the two parties is as wide as the Gallup and MORI polls suggest, although Labour also feel it is not as slim as five percent.

Both parties would prefer a closer race, the Conservatives to engender hope they could still win, Labour to ensure their supporters turn out to vote.

The Channel 4 poll, which was carried out between Friday and Wednesday, also suggested that up to half the electorate had not firmly decided which way they would vote.

The interviews which formed the basis for the MORI figures were carried out on Tuesday.
