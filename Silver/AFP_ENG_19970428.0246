Government researchers found six years ago that dogs were susceptible to a form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or "mad cow" disease, from eating contaminated pet food, press reports Monday said.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, commenting on the report in The Independant, confirmed the results of the 1992 study were never published and that no follow-up was done.

At the time, government scientists had studied the brains of 444 hunting hounds that had died after showing signs of distress associated with BSE, and found abnormalities called fibrils, tiny fibres first noticed by scientists studying scrapie, a spongiform encephalopathy in sheep.

The presence of fibrils, said the scientists, confirmed that some of the brains showed signs of a canine equivalent of mad cow disease.

Consultant microbiologist Stephen Dealler, a leading critic of government handling of the BSE crisis, said it was "incredible that this experiment was known about before the last general election."

The test results were reported verbally to the Government's advisers on BSE in 1992, he said, but then chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, David Tyrell, said the dog study should not be taken further.

A ministry spokesman said the study was halted because no danger to public health had been ascertained.

"You can be absolutely certain that the presence of scrapie associated fibrils shows these dogs had the disease," said Dealler.

Last week, Norwegian scientists said they thought an 11-year-old golden retriever had died from spongiform encephalopathy, and linked the dog's death to pet food made from cattle remains imported from Britain.

But British health sources said it was unlikely the Norwegian dog could have picked up the disease after September 1990 when bovine offal was banned from pet food in Britian.

Cats, however, are known to be affected by spongiform encephalopathy and at least 75 of them have already died from the feline version of the disease.
