Seven more helicopters have joined the search Thursday for a powered glider with two people aboard that went missing during a competition in South New Zealand late Wednesday afternoon.

They joined four fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter which resumed searching at first light for the glider, four hours after taking off from Omarama, about 119 km northwest of Oamaru.

Rescue Co-ordination Center New Zealand (RCCNZ) said four fixed- wing aircraft are scouring the search area as widely and quickly as possible while the helicopters search at a lower and more detailed level.

Several glider pilots and trained observers are among the air search personnel.

Visibility remains good in the search area but worsening weather conditions are forecast for later in the day.

Police continue to search the numerous airstrips in the area and are asking locals to check their properties for any sign of the missing glider or the two people on board.

Ground-based search and rescue teams were ready to move if required.
