The 2010 Soccer World Cup to be hosted by South Africa is set to attract South African players who are plying their trade abroad to come home.

Current players at South Africa's national team, Bafana Bafana, are to form basis of the 2010 team and most of the overseas-based players seem to think that they will be forgotten if they are far from home.

Michael Nkambule, just signing with the country's Premier League club SuperSport United, has said his return from French team RC Strasbourg was due to his ambition to play for the senior national team, the SAPA news agency reported on Monday.

While most of the South African-based players still believe that going abroad enhances the chances of a national team call-up, they might re-think that if those abroad are making a comeback, then it is wise to stay put, the SAPA said.

Nkambule is on a one-year loan deal and will join the players such as Mamelodi Sundowns trio of Bennet Mnguni, Mbulelo Mabizela and Josta Dladla as well as Golden Arrows' Japhet Zwane who came home with the hope of reviving their international careers.

Outgoing Bafana Bafana coach, Pitso Mosiamne, said South African players, especially those who do not see regular action, are desperately looking for local teams.

Bafana's German-based Sibusiso Zuma has also expressed his desire to return home, the SAPA said.
