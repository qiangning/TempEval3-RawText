Scientists from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) found that Tibetan antelopes largely inhabit chilly grassland and marshlands areas in Hoh Xil (kekexili) nature reserve, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

Dr. Lu Xuefeng from CAS, a member of an expedition team in Hoh Xil, said that years of research and observation and a recent expedition found Tibetan antelopes have special habitat.

Tibetan antelopes can take advantage of fluctuant landscape to dodge its natural enemies, he said.

Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is home to dozens of endangered animals. China has taken a series of substantial measures to protect Tibetan antelopes, an extremely rare species listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

Thanks to years of government efforts to control illegal hunting, ban commercial activities and protect grassland, the environment of Hoh Xil is becoming more and more suitable for antelopes, Lu said.

But Tibetan antelopes are targeted by poachers for use of their cashmere, causing their population to decline from several million to less than 100,000 in the past two decades, sources say.
