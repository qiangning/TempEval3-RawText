The South African government may amend a financial intelligence law to give it more stringency in the fight against money laundering and the financing of international terrorism.

The review of the Financial Intelligence Center Act (FICA) could enable the Financial Intelligence Center to have wider supervisory powers, Safety and Security Minister Charles Nqakula said at Parliament on Wednesday, the South African media reported.

The Financial Intelligence Center is an affiliate of the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF), of which South Africa is currently holding the presidency.

Since its inception in February 2003, the center had received 33,435 reports of suspicious financial transactions from reporting institutions, which included banks and other financial institutions, Nqakula said.

Nqakula, also chairman of the justice, crime prevention and security (JCPS) cluster of ministries, said the review of the law would be part of the cluster's attempts to strengthen counter- measures against money laundering and the funding of international terrorism, reported the SAPA news agency.

The act currently provides for the reporting of "suspicious transactions" by financial and other institutions to the center for investigation.

These suspicious acts include money transfers exceeding 100,000 rand (about 15,000 US dollars) and the purchase of specialized goods including expensive cars.

This information, however, may not be used as evidence in court, which Deputy Justice Minister Johnny de Langa said was rather pointless.

"It is all good and well to let everyone report but if you don' t have the power to follow up, to check, to verify then it's absolutely toothless," he was quoted as saying.

He said the decision to extend the powers was still under debate but if the act was amended the center could become an effective tool in the fight against organized crime.

In a drive to expand the intelligence gathering capabilities in Africa, South Africa earlier this week hosted a financial intelligence workshop attended by 14 Eastern and Southern African countries, according to the government's news service BuaNews.

"It is our hope that the seed would have been planted during the sessions to build a solid foundation toward the establishment on the African continent of regimes to counter all financial transactions that relate to organized crime and terrorism," Nqakula said.
