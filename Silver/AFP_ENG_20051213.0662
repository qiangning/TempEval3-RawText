Australian flag-carrier Qantas announced Wednesday that it had chosen Boeing's 787 long-haul airliner as the "cornerstone" for a major renewal of its fleet, snubbing rival Airbus for a deal expected to be worth some 20 billion US dollars.

The Qantas board said it would acquire 115 of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, rather than the Airbus 350s.

Qantas said it was ordering 65 of the twin-engine, wide-body aircraft for delivery from 2008 for use by Qantas and its budget offshoot Jetstar, which is due to begin international operations in 2007.

The airline also took purchase rights for an additional 50 787's to account for future growth of its fleet.

The decision was a blow for Airbus, which had been pushing its fuel efficient A350 to Qantas.

Qantas Chief Executive Geoff Dixon said the tender had been "very competitive, with excellent options proposed by both Boeing and Airbus".

"The Boeing 787 provides breakthrough technology, enabling us to fly further to more point-to-point destinations throughout the world at a cost equivalent to operating larger aircraft like the Boeing 747-400," he said.

"The Boeing 787 is ideal for operating to Asia, as well the USA and Europe, and with 300 seats, will enable both Qantas and Jetstar to closely target markets without compromising efficiency," he said.

"Its new technology engines, cutting-edge airframe and increased seat count also offer a significant reduction in costs ... compared to the current Boeing 767."

Dixon said one of Qantas' priorities in choosing Boeing was the need to have Jetstar to be ready for international operations by early 2007 "with the fastest possible transition to new technology, more efficient aircraft."

Jetstar would begin its overseas operations with an interim fleet of four A330-200 aircraft and move to a fleet of 10 new Boeing 787s with delivery of the first aircraft scheduled for August 2008.

Qantas Chairwoman Margaret Jackson said the purchase of the new aircraft would be funded from operating cash flow.

"These new aircraft are vital for our continued growth in the face of increasing competition in the years ahead," she said.

"They will cater for international capacity growth and new routes, as well as replacing the Qantas Groups fleet of wide-body Boeing 767-300s," she said.

Center for Asia Pacific Aviation chief executive Peter Harbison said both Boeing and Airbus were likely to have proposed incentives to win the orders.

Airbus had been a strong competitor in the past, offering perks like full pilot training, he said.

Qantas has already approved orders for 12 of Airbus's new super jumbo A380s, with the company planning to fly the aircraft on the Australia-US route after delivery in late 2006.
