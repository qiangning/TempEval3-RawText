The Dutch government on Tuesday vowed to develop relations with China, despite Beijing's rebuttal of a visit by the country's economic minister, following European criticism of its human rights record.

In a statement, the Netherlands, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, said it would "continue to commit itself to developing relations with China."

However, neither the Dutch foreign nor economic ministries would comment on China's decision on Tuesday to postpone all exchanges of visits with Denmark and to block a trip to Beijing by Dutch Economic Minister Hans Wijers scheduled for June 7-14.

The move to postpone the trip, which had been set for June 7-14, came after The Hague, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, sought to sponsor an EU resolution criticising China at the annual session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.

Economics Minister Hans Wijers, who was to lead the delegation, "is not welcome," the Chinese authorities told The Hague.

The Netherlands reacted furiously early this month when France, Germany, Italy and Spain refused to back an EU motion, calling the affair "a serious reversal for the prospects of an EU foreign policy."

Denmark then took the initiative to put forward its own resolution damning Beijing's rights record, which is due to go before a vote in the 53-member commission later Tuesday.

Beijing retaliated immediately, a foreign ministry spokesman stating Tuesday that "China will postpone exchanges of visits with Denmark and stop further dialogue on human rights."

Denmark's motion received support from nine fellow EU members, the United States, Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland.

The EU has made a resolution condemning China to the commission every year since the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in 1989, but each time China has managed to garner just enough support -- notably from developing countries -- to avoid formal censure.
