The European Union (EU)'s top financial watchdog has given a qualified approval of the EU accounts for 2004, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) said in a report Tuesday.

Speaking at the European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg, France, ECA President Hubert Weber said that the court was unable to sign off the EU accounts for the 11th consecutive year, according to a press release on the EU's website.

But Weber added that compared with the previous year, the quality of the accounts had improved, with nearly one-third of EU spending ratified by the ECA, a jump from 6 percent in 2003.

However, Weber said that for a variety of spending accounts, notably agricultural spending, the court was not in a position to approve.

"The supervisory and control systems are not yet implemented and operating effectively and payments are still affected by errors," he told European legislators.

But he stressed that this did not mean that fraud was rife throughout the EU.

"The court's opinion on these matters cannot be interpreted as all transactions of the 2004 payment budget being affected by error as an indication of fraud," he said.

Agricultural spending was particularly error-strewn, Weber said, although the European Commission (EC) and national governments had improved their controls compared to the previous year.

He said that new control measures covering 59 percent of farm payments had had a positive impact "where properly applied," while checks covering 37 percent of the agricultural payments not covered by these new measures "did not provide reasonable assurance that they comply with legislation."

Weber was particularly critical of the national authorities, who account for 80 percent of budget payments, saying "the improvement in systems and controls at the level of the commission has not been reflected in those within the member states."

When urging national authorities to work more closely with the commission to identify areas for improvement, Weber suggested, for example, the scope of current checking procedures be extended to include the legality and regularity of expenditure.

Reacting to the ECA report, the European Commission said in a statement that it broadly agreed with the ECA conclusions.

The EC Vice-President Siim Kallas, who is responsible for relations with the Court of Auditors, said the report was "fair and balanced," adding that it had taken note of the improvements in the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy and the commission's management systems.

He admitted that there was still a lot to do and called for more cooperation from national and regional governments in improving budget spending.
