Two US Marines are to face murder charges in connection with the killing of 24 Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha last year, defense lawyers and relatives of the men said Thursday.

Sergeant Frank Wuterich is to face 13 counts of murder, his lawyer said, while Lance Corporal Justin Sharratt has been told he will face three murder charges, his father told reporters.
