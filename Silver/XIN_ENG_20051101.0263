Five Israeli right-wing youths have been rejected from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) draft due to suspicions they were involved in violence against security personnel during the Gaza withdrawal, local newspaper Yedioth Aharonoth reported on Tuesday.

The recruitment date of the youths, initially set for this month, has been indefinitely delayed, a senior IDF Personnel Directorate officer was cited as saying.

The decision is in accordance with a policy established by IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz, according to which the IDF will refuse to draft youths convicted of violence against soldiers and police during the pullout, according to the report.

Currently, more than 100 youths are under examination on possible involvement in anti-withdrawal violence before the IDF decide on whether to enlist them.

Israel withdrew settlers and troops from the entire Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank in September.

The pullout, designed to "disengage" from violence with the Palestinians, has met with fierce opposition from rightists and some settlers.
