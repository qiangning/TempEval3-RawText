The World Trade Organisation talks here must come up with a firm commitment to help African cotton producers, who count as some of the poorest countries on earth, the Group of 20 said Tuesday.

The G-20, which comprises developed countries and the largest emerging economies, said problems faced by African cotton producers reflect distortions in global trade of agricultural goods.

"The plight of the African cotton producing countries and of other cotton producers in the developing world is evidence of the distortions in agriculture that we are committed to eliminate," the G-20 said in a statement;

"The G-20 ministers emphasise the need for a firm commitment to be made at Hong Kong to address the issue of cotton ambitiously."

The WTO meeting in Hong Kong, which opens later Tuesday, is tasked with keeping on track the faltering four-year-old Doha Round meant to tear down global trade barriers and spur growth in the world's poorest nations.

The key issue is farm trade, mainly the system of European and US subsidies which they say they will only surrender in exchange for a deal opening up markets in the developed world to their industrial goods and services.

Africa's cotton-producing countries have been on the offensive in the run-up to the meeting, insisting that rich countries, and the United States in particular, end subsidies to their cotton farmers.

The African states say such subsidies depress prices globally and effectively shut them out of what should be major markets, undercutting their development efforts.

Asked earlier Tuesday whether Washington would be willing to come to an agreement on cotton here, US Trade Representative Rob Portman said: "In July 2004 we agreed to deal with cotton expeditiously, ambitiously and specifically, within the framework of the agricultural negotiations.

"If we can resolve something this week with regards to cotton, that would be great," he said, without elaborating.
