The Spanish coast guards on Wednesday arrested 36 illegal immigrants, including three women and two minors, on a boat off the coast of Granada in southeast Spain, local media reported.

One of the children was suffering from severe hypothermia and was taken to hospital in Granadan town Motril. The rest of the detainees were taken to a police reception center in Motril, where they would receive humanitarian aid from the Red Cross Organization.

The coast guards have arrested 2,669 undocumented immigrants off the coast of Granada so far this year. In November alone, the coast guards have already detained 201 immigrants, the majority of whom came from Africa to seek a better life in Spain.
