European Union foreign ministers made little progress on wide-ranging reform of Europe's institutions during a two-day meeting which ended Monday.

The lack of progress prompted German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to say after the summit that there were "plenty of things which point to the need for a special summit on reform of the institutions" at the end of May.

Talks expected to take place in Maastricht on the Dutch-German border have been pencilled in for May 23.

They would be aimed at assessing whether it will be possible to reach a deal on revamping EU policies and institutions -- judged vital if the Union is to bring in up to 10 eastern European countries and Cyprus over the next decade -- in time for the Amsterdam summit on June 16-17.

That summit is due to wind-up the work of the long-running Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), launched at the Turin summit in March last year.

The May meeting would take place after the British general election on May 1, cited as one of the main reasons why so little progress was made here.

Ministers openly admitted here that progress in the negotiations was proving difficult because of the uncertainty created by the looming election.

Britain's current Conservative government stands alone among the 15 EU administrations in its across-the-board opposition to any reduction in the scope of national vetoes in policy decisions.

It is also isolated on plans to transfer responsibiilty on immigration, asylum and border policies and the fight against cross- border crime from national capitals to Brussels, its demands for the power of the European Court of Justice to be curtailed and in its fervent opposition to a common EU social policy.

EU diplomats are optimistic that if, as expected, Labour leader Tony Blair triumphs on May 1, Britain will adopt a more flexible approach.

But while Labour has committed itself to ending Britain's opt-out from EU social policy, the party has otherwise given few indications that it will radically change Britain's approach to Europe.

It also became clear here that Britain is far from being the only major obstacle to a deal being concluded at Amsterdam.

French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette insisted that Paris would not sign up for a new treaty unless the EU's executive arm, the commission, was reduced from 20 to between 10 and 12 members.

This is fiercely opposed by small EU states like Ireland and Luxembourg as it would mean some of them not having a commissioner. Although commissioners are supposed to act in the interests of Europe, countries regard them as an important voice in Brussels' corridors of power.

At present the five biggest countries have two commissioners (Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and the other 10 one each.

British foreign office minister David Davies said the big countries could not be expected to give up one of their commissioners without getting something in return.

"It is not just for large countries to make sacrifices," he said. If Britain lost a commissioner it would expect its remaining representative to have a bigger say in decisions or to be given one of the more important portfolios, he said.

"If we give up a commissioner that has to be reflected in some other way."

Britain, France and Germany also want voting in the EU Council of Ministers reweighted to bring it more into line with population sizes.

Under the present system, tiny Luxembourg has two votes for a population of 400,000 while Germany has 10 for a population of 79 million.
