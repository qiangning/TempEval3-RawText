Thai Ratings and Information Services (TRIS) announced Thursday it was forming a three-year partnership with Fitch Investors Service of the United States.

TRIS president Vuthipong Priebjrivat said his agency, which previously had a training arrangement with Standards and Poor's, would sign the agreement to exchange staff and information with Fitch on May 6.

He said Fitch had been chosen for the partnership due to its specialization in rating structured finance issues covering securitization, insurance businesses, bonds, mutual funds and pension funds.

"This agreement will help TRIS upgrade to international standards," he said.

Vuthipong added that this specialization was in line with the Thai government's efforts to boost the domestic bond market.

While the two companies would work closely together in Thailand, they would be rating companies separately, giving clients two ratings for the price of one, Vuthipong said, adding that the grades would necessarily be the same.

The TRIS president said the two companies would also promote each other's ratings and analytical qualifications and adopt a joint rating process for both domestic and international issues.
