US President George W. Bush will make a rare address to the nation from his Oval Office at 9:00 pm Sunday (0200 GMT Monday) to discuss the way forward in Iraq, his spokesman said Friday.

"The Iraqi people just concluded a historic election and we're now entering a critical period for our mission in Iraq, and the president will talk about what we've accomplished and where we're headed," said Scott McClellan.

The last time Bush made an address to the nation from the Oval Office was in March 2003 to announce the beginning of the US-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein, the spokesman said.

The remarks, which were expected to run 20 minutes or less, were to cap a public relations offensive that saw Bush give four speeches touting progress on the political, economic and security fronts.

The rhetorical onslaught came after deadly violence in Iraq fueled Bush's sharp drop in the polls this year, though they have recently edged up from what had been their lowest levels since he took office in January 2001.

On another front, the US president was to take the unusual step of delivering his weekly Saturday radio address live, as part of an effort to pressure lawmakers into renewing the controversial Patriot Act package of anti-terrorism measures.
