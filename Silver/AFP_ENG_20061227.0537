Ethiopian troops backing Somali government forces were closer to the capital Mogadishu Thursday as the UN Security Council failed to reach consensus on a statement calling for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Somalia and an end to military operations.

"We could not reach consensus" on the non-binding statement, said Mutlaq al-Qahtani, a UN delegate from Qatar, which chairs the 15-member council and drafted the text.

It was the second day in a row that the 15 members failed to reach common ground and they finally decided to give up their attempt as it became clear there was no hope of a consensus.

Meanwhile the UN braced for tens of thousands of refugees flooding into neighbouring Kenya and Ethiopia.

On Wednesday pro-government forces seized Jowhar, about 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of Mogadishu and rolled south, with the Islamists carrying out what they described as a "tactical retreat" under air attacks.

A pro-government army commander told AFP late Wednesday that his troops were now in the town of Balad, just 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of the capital.

A spokesman for the Somali transitional government said earlier Mogadishu would not be taken by force.

"There is a fear among the population in the capital that the government will force its way into Mogadishu but we are not going to do that," said Information Minister Ali Ahmed Jamah.

Jamah said government troops would surround Mogadishu to leave time for negotiations and force the Islamists to take part in dialogue.

"There are negotiations underway between the leaders of various groups in Mogadishu, so that the people of Mogadishu, those who have chased away the warlords, we want them to convince the extremists to leave the country peacefully so that nothing bad happens there," he said.

Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has also said he was not interested in capturing Mogadishu.

In Kenya, whose government helped shape Somalia's interim regime in 2004, diplomats said the Islamists had agreed to attend talks in Nairobi on Thursday to contain the situation.

As concern mounted worldwide of an impending bloodbath and massive displacement of civilians, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) urged parties to spare the city due to the potential for "enormous human losses".

"To carry the battle to the capital is likely to force thousands of civilians... to flee and exacerbate the humane catastrophe," said OIC Secretary General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu.

The Islamists, meanwhile, vowed to maintain security in Mogadishu.

"The security we are enjoying is very important and we cannot let violent people destabilize our city," Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the chairman of the Islamist executive committee, told a press conference in Mogadishu.

The African Union and the Arab League urged Ethiopia to pull out and for the rivals to observe a truce, while the OIC warned fighting could worsen "the humanitarian tragedy already unfolding".

But Somali Information Minister Jamah said: "The Ethiopians have a limited objective. They came at the invitation of a legitimate government to rout out these extremist elements from Somalia. It is limited in scope and limited in time.

"They will go back very soon, almost 80 percent of our mission is completed ... There were common interests, they (the Islamists) were threatening us and also threatening Ethiopia."

In June, the Islamists seized Mogadishu and much of Somalia, leaving the US-backed transitional government only in control of the town of Baidoa.

But as the Islamists advanced on Baidoa, Ethiopia moved to shore up the government. Heavy fighting then erupted last week after the Islamists made good on a vow to launch attacks if Ethiopian troops failed to pull out within a week.

The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) meanwhile warned that as many as 50,000 refugees could pour into neighbouring countries.

"Although no large-scale refugee movements from Somalia have yet been recorded in neighbouring countries, UNHCR is immediately positioning relief items in the region for up to 50,000 people..." it said.

UNHCR said from its Geneva headquarters it was mobilising staff and resources.

"In addition to the immediate pre-positioning of relief items, UNHCR will also increase its existing stockpiles in the region by purchasing enough supplies for a further 100,000 people, refugees as well as internally displaced people," a statement said.

Eritrean President Issaias Afeworki, meanwhile, blamed arch-rival Ethiopia for the escalating conflict.

Issaias said the "current situation in Somalia is the result of the intervention of foreign forces, particularly Ethiopia," according to a statement published in the country's information ministry website.

Analysts have accused the two Horn of Africa nations, still at odds over the unresolved border row that sparked their 1998-2000 war, of fighting a proxy war in Somalia.
