The trial of the alleged plotters of a 1975 coup in which Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed was opened and then abruptly adjourned Monday.

The surprise move came when a defence lawyer tabled a motion of "no confidence" against the judge on the first day of the hearing. The motion will now be ruled on by the High Court.

The court was adjourned about two hours into the trial, and the court set April 29 for the next hearing.

Sheikh Mujib, also father of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed, was slain with most of his family in the August 15, 1975 coup. For more than 20 years, no action was taken against the coup-leaders, until Sheikh Hasina swept his Awami League back into power last year.

Defence lawyer Mahbubur Rahman, a MP of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, moved the no-confidence motion after trial judge Kazi Golam Rasul rejected an appeal to suspend the trial.

Rahman wanted time to first petition the High Court against the indictment of his client Zobaida Rashid, wife of one of the alleged key plotters retired colonel Abdur Rashid.

But Rasul refused the request saying the High Court could issue an order to stay the proceedings at any time during the hearing.

"After receiving any such order from the High Court, the trial of the court would be immediately stopped and therefore there is no reason to wait for a order," he said.

Legal experts said the High Court was likely to issue a stay order to hear the defence petition and may transfer the case to another court.
