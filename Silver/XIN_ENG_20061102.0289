The Cairo-based Arab League (AL) said on Thursday that it would continue its efforts to help resume Somali parties' negotiations on the crisis they are facing.

AL Secretary General Amr Moussa promised in press statements to exert further AL efforts to resume negotiations till the Somali crisis was resolved.

Although Somali negotiations are facing difficulties due to conflicting stances, the AL has kept contacts to stop the Somali crisis from any possible escalation and have Somali factions return to negotiations, Moussa said.

He added that talks could resume in the coming few weeks as the AL keeps in touch with the Somali government and the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) to resume negotiations.

Moussa further noted that the AL delegation to the Somali crisis negotiations will meet and discuss a demand for a fact- finding commission proposed by some Somali parties, before discussions on all aspects of the Somali question.

Somalia was plunged into lawlessness in 1991 after the ousting of strongman Mohamed Siad Barre and the nation of some 10 million population was then divided into a patchwork of fiefdoms governed by unruly warlords.
