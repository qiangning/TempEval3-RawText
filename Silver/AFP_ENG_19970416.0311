A second contingent of French troops left the southern port of Toulon on Wednesday to support the multinational military mission in Albania, officials said.

Six hundred men left on board a chartered car-ferry and were due arrive off the coast of the Albanian port of Durres by Friday morning, to join some 350 French troops who arrived in Durres on Tuesday.

Eight countries have committed troops to Operation Alba, which has a UN-backed mandate to safeguard deliveries of relief aid to Albania in the wake of an armed uprising against President Sali Berisha.
