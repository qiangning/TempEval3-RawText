The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, a watering-hole for yachties throughout the British colonial period, has launched a fresh bid to settle the problem of its royal connections as the territory's handover to China looms.

Less than a year after the club was wracked by internal debate about whether to scrap the "Royal" from its name, the organisation told members in a letter received Tuesday that it was floating other proposals to present a less British image.

Ideas put forward "to reflect the change of status of Hong Kong on July 1" include removal of the crown from the logo and club flag, and its replacement by the bauhinia flower, the emblem of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.

The present club insignia, which sells well on T-shirts, bags and other merchandise, comprises a Chinese dragon topped by the British crown.

Other proposals are that the club "look to the sovereign power for patronage," the letter said, adding future SAR chief executive Tung Chee-Hwa would be solicited for his views.

The letter, from club commodore David Kong, added the club's general committee had resolved "the club will not take any action, or fail to take any action, which may be viewed as inappropriate by the incoming and outgoing government."

In January, club sources said the club was poring over a proposal to ask Chinese President Jiang Zemin to become patron and Tung vice- patron, replacing Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Governor Chris Patten respectively.

But, despite the comfort and famous setting of the club on Hong Kong's harbour-front, it is unclear whether Jiang, as head of a communist state, would wish to become patron of a club that still has "Royal" in its title.

In May 1996, a bitter internal debate broke out about dropping the word, with some members arguing at a special meeting that the club faced a range of problems, ranging from help from the Chinese navy to administrative hurdles, if it maintained this verbal legacy.

Under the club's statutes, any name change has to be supported by 75 percent of those voting in a ballot.

The motion to drop the royal patronage garnered 2,542 votes, with 1,719 against, or just under 60 percent support. A similar vote in 1995 won 73 percent support for the name change.

The letter said an extraordinary general meeting would be held on June 12 to choose a Chinese name for the club. This was because "Chinese will become the official language of the SAR, (so) it is necessary for our club to register its name in Chinese as part of our proper business title."

Kong could not be reached immediately for further comment.

The royal row has been repeated in clubs and institutions throughout the territory, which returns to Chinese rule on July 1 after more than 156 years as a British colony.

The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, which runs the local horse racing and betting industry, have already dropped the "Royal" tag, as has the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which followed suit on New Year's Day 1997.

The Royal Hong Kong Police Force will become simply the Hong Kong Police Force on July 1, complete with a new cap badge.

In 1994, Hong Kong's currency-issuing banks began replacing the effigy of the Queen with the bauhinia.

Ironically, the full name of the pink five-pistilled flower -- bauhinia blakeana -- is named after Sir Henry Blake, a former colonial governor.
