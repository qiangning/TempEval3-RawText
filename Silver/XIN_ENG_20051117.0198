Argentina's David Nalbandian breezed past unformed Ivan Ljubicic for a second berth to the semifinals of the season-ending ATP tennis Masters Cup, beating the Croatian 6-2, 6-2 here on Thursday.

The sluggish Ljubicic, who failed to show any of his tennis as that in latest matches, returned the serve from Nalbandian out of rebound to end up his misery in just one hour and seven minutes.

Committing 7 unforced errors besides 11 forced ones, the Croatian was down 5-0 shortly into the match.

With the victory, the 23-year-old Nalbandian, who converted five out of total six break points into winners on Thursday, joined world number one Roger Federer and top Russian Nikolay Davydenko to qualify for the semis at the 4.45 million US dollars event.

Ljubicic, who enjoyed his best season by winning two ATP titles in eight finals and broke into top ten for first time, cracked five aces throughout the match but failed to hold his nerve against the steady-handed Nalbandian.

The 26-year-old sensation of the late-season, who hardly upset the superlative Swiss Federer in his Red Group opener on Sunday, had earned a place in Shanghai thanks to his autumn efforts, including the indoor title win over the past month in Metz and Vienna as well as the final encounters in both the Masters Series Madrid and Paris two week ago.
