French rail services on Thursday returned to normal after trade unions scrapped a plan for a prolonged nationwide strike over pay, pensions and the possible privatization of state railway company SNCF.

The unions accepted the offer of an interim pay rise of 0.3 percent pending wage talks in January, and a promise that each employee will receive a bonus of at least 120 euros.

President Jacques Chirac pledged on Tuesday not to privatise SNCF, a move to fend off a prolonged strike that could further tarnish France's image after three weeks of rioting in the suburbs.

The strike, which began on Monday evening, left only one in three international high-speed trains (TGV) running at its peak on Tuesday.

Eurostar linking London and Thalys linking Brussels had four out of five trains running. Train service to Italy, Spain and Switzerland were also affected. Overnight trains between Paris and Barcelona were canceled Monday and Tuesday.

"It's over," SNCF Chairman Louis Gallois told France 2 television.

The strike had cost SNCF up to 30 million euros (35.3 million US dollars), said Galloise.
