The mainly Moslem city of Sarajevo surprised pilgrims visiting for the mass celebrated Sunday by Pope John Paul II with its sharp climate but it also showed its beautified face and offered a glimpse at what it used to be, welcoming the guests with tolerance.

The city that spent four million German marks (2.4 million dollars) working in a frenzy for the past two weeks to welcome the most important guest it has ever hosted, greeted the pilgrims coming from all over the country and abroad with snow-flakes and wind chilling the bones.

Hundreds of buses carrying thousands of pilgrims began arriving in Sarajevo at dawn to specially-allocated parking lots in the city centre from which they walked to the Kosevo stadium where the mass took place.

Quietly and at the temperature of only zero Centigrade (32 degrees Fahrenheit) in the morning the faithful walked towards the newly- refurbished stadium while the city, except for hundreds of policemen and soldiers of the NATO-led peace force at every corner, still slept.

Tired, yawning after spending the whole night travelling aboard buses, their faces and hands red with cold, the pilgrims trod along the closed-to-traffic streets and boulevards decorated by Bosnian state flags, huge Papal posters and recently planted seedlings.

The white-and-yellow Vatican flags the pilgrims carried in their hands, scarves in the same fashion, and the flags of Bosnian Croat statelet Herceg-Bosna and the neighbouring Republic of Croatia, provoked no reaction from passers-by in the city in which only 30,000 Catholic Croats live.

"We do not feel at all that we are in a Moslem city, we had no problems here", Zeljka Bajan, a 27-year-old housewife from the Croatian coastal city of Sibenik, said.

Like so many other pilgrims Bajan saw for the first time the war-scars that the face-lift could not remove such as the shattered Zetra sports hall just by the stadium.

But the most shocking to all was the nearby football-pitch-turned- graveyard where hundreds of people were buried and its neighbour accross the road, the Lion's cemetery.

"It is sad to see all the ruins. We were shocked with what we saw and could understand better now what the people here went through", Bajan said.

Pilgrims coming from both the Moslem-Croat federation and the Republika Srpska, Bosnia's two post-war entities, said they encountered no problems travelling to Sarajevo.

Although not all the 60,000 faithful that the Church expected did come, the 40,000 that filled the stadium showed they had no fear.

"If the pope was ready to come here then why should I not come as well", Antija Zlatun, from the central Bosnian town of Novi Travnik, said when asked about the recent series of attacks against Catholic churches and monasteries in Sarajevo.

Munib Usanovic, 50-year-old servant of the federal government and a Moslem from Sarajevo who went to the mass "because it is an event that happens once in a lifetime," expressed the shame many citizens feel about the attacks and the finding on Saturday of explosives set along the papal route.

"That was probably done by somebody who wanted to tarnish the image of Sarajevo as the town opened to all people of good will", Usanovic said.

"I cannot imagine anybody who would want to miss this mass, I cannot imagine why anybody would be upset by this visit", he said hoping that people unpoisoned by intolerance still prevail in the city.
