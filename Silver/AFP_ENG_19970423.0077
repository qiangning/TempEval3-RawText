Palestinian President Yasser Arafat headed for Jordan on Wednesday for talks with King Hussein on the stalemated peace process, Palestinian officials said.

Before leaving for the Red Sea resort of Aqaba where the Jordanian monarch is recovering from prostate surgery, Arafat received an "urgent" telephone call from US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, official Palestinian radio said.

It said the conversation concerned the peace process, but it provided no further details.

Nabil Abu Rudeina, a senior Arafat aide, said the Palestinian and Jordanian leaders "are meeting to consult and coordinate their actions to confront the challenges facing the peace process, which is still in a real crisis."

King Hussein was expected to brief Arafat on his talks last month in Washington with President Bill Clinton which focused on trying to resolve a major crisis in the Israel-Palestinian peace process.

Abu Rudeina said Arafat would in turn inform King Hussein about his talks earlier this month with US Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who met with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders in an unsuccessful bid to revive negotiations between the two sides.

The peace process has been frozen since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered construction to begin last month on a new Jewish neighborhood in disputed east Jerusalem.

Netanyahu also infuriated the Palestinians by slowing the transfer of West Bank land to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.

The decisions sparked widespread violent protests in the Palestinian territories and a string of anti-Israeli bombings.

King Hussein has been highly critical of Netanyahu's policies, and has met twice with the Israeli leader, including once earlier this month in the United States, in an effort to convince him to soften his stand.

Netanyahu has refused Palestinian demands to freeze construction of new Jewish settlements or to speed up the extension of self-rule, insisting that the peace process can resume only once Arafat cracks down on anti-Israeli violence.
