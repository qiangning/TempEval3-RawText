US industrial output expanded by 0.7 percent in November over the month before as the energy industry rebounded from damaging hurricanes, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

The increase was just ahead of analysts' forecast for a rise in production of 0.5 percent, and compared with an upwardly revised gain of 1.3 percent in October.

"Further recoveries in petrochemical and energy-related industries affected by the hurricanes again contributed significantly to the increase in output in November," the Fed said in a statement.

Powerful hurricanes in late August and September played havoc with US oil drilling and refining activities in the Gulf of Mexico and on the southern coast.

Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent in November, the Fed said. Output at mines surged 4.8 percent in November after falling in the previous four months, while production at utilities was up 0.3 percent.

Output of consumer goods fell 0.8 percent but construction was up 0.5 percent.
