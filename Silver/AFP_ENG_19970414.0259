Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived here Monday determined to ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to make "more" efforts to save the peace process from collapse.

"I will ask President Mubarak for more efforts and I will thank him for what he is doing to protect the peace process," Arafat told reporters before heading into talks with the Egyptian leader at the Ittihadiya presidential palace outside Cairo.

The Palestinian president said he will discuss with Mubarak ways of "saving" the peace process from collapse because of Israel's "persistence in violating the accords which were signed."

The talks are focused on Israel's settlement policy as well as the closure of Palestinian territories, Arafat said.
