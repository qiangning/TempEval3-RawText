When Sebastian Soria moved to Qatar from his native Uruguay, he had no idea where the tiny desert country was in the world.

Two years on, the striker has not only made Doha his home but has taken Qatari citizenship and the national team into the Asian Games final.

"I was brought to Qatar in September, 2004 by French coach Bruno Metsu (the man who led Senegal at the 2002 World Cup finals) who was at Al Gharrafa at the time," recalled Soria.

"When I received the offer I jumped at the opportunity. But I had to look it up on the map because I didn't know where Qatar was."

Soria was granted citizenship on the eve of the Games.

He made his debut for the senior side in an Asian Cup qualifier against Uzbekistan in November and has since played a starring role, scoring four goals as Qatar reached their first ever Asian Games gold medal match.

Iraq await them in Friday's final.

Soria made an immediate impact in his first league season at Al Gharrafa scoring 14 goals as his new club won the domestic Q-League.

The following season, he moved to Qatar Sports Club, hit 19 goals and was named player of the year.

"We want to win a medal here," said Soria who has former Nigerian star Jay Jay Okacha as a teammate at Qatar Sports Club.

"Then we have the Gulf Cup in the UAE in January. But my ultimate dream is to make the World Cup finals with Qatar.

"This is a young and talented group. We have a good infrastructure, an ever-growing league and I think we can do well against the best teams in Asia like Saudi Arabia and Japan."

Soria, who hit the first goal in the 2-0 semi-final win against defending champions Iran, could become the tournament's top scorer in the final. At the moment, he is one behind Uzbekistan's Alexandr Geynrikh.

"When I play I try to help the team to win," he said.

"If I have the chance to become the top scorer then I will try and score as many goals as possible. If I score two more it will mean that Qatar will have more chances to win the gold medal."

Despite being a foreign import, Soria has not faced the kind of angry backlash which has engulfed the country's legion of Kenyan track stars winning gold in the athletics.

Unlike the runners, Soria actually spends all of his time in Doha and for that, Qatar's Bosnian coach Dzelamudin Musovic is eternally grateful.

"A player like him can do a world of good to any side," said Musovic.

"But what I like and I am happy about is to see him jell well with the other players. More than anything, I feel that's the quality I like in him.

"He can also resolve many problems up front -- he can score and can deliver those crucial passes."
