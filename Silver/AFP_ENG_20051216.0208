World demand for oil will increase 1.9 percent in 2006, to 84.9 million barrels a day, OPEC said in a December report released in Vienna on Friday.

The forecast is a "slight increase" over its outlook issued in November, due to stronger-than-expected predictions for world economic growth next year, OPEC said.

Oil demand will increase in all major regions, with China accounting for more than one fifth of the increase of 1.6 million bpd.

For this year, the oil cartel lowered its estimate for demand to 83.3 million bpd, which represents an increase of 1.5 percent compared with demand in 2004.

This forecast was in line with estimates by the International Energy Agency, which had said in its monthly report published on Tuesday that oil demand would grow by 1.4 percent this year.

However, the IEA said that it expected oil demand to grow by 2.2 percent next year to 85.2 million bpd, higher than the forecast by OPEC.

On Monday, the 11 members of OPEC had met in Kuwait City and decided to leave their production levels unchanged at 30 million bpd, declaring themselves happy with current market conditions and vowing to take action in the event of a fall in prices during winter.

OPEC members are currently benefiting from high prices of oil, but are also producing at near full-capacity with output at levels unseen for 25 years.

On Friday, oil prices fell amid forecasts of warmer-than-expected weather in the United States, the world's largest consumer of energy.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in January, slipped 29 cents to 59.70 dollars per barrel in electronic trading.

In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for February delivery shed 36 cents to 59.04 dollars per barrel. The January contract had closed on Thursday up 25 cents at 59.85 dollars.
