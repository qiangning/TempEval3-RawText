Indonesia's head telecommunications official Thursday called on people to limit Internet use to give priority to aid workers in disaster areas.

Indonesia and many other countries in the region have had little or no Internet access since a quake off Taiwan on Tuesday damaged underwater fibre-optic cables.

"I call for everyone to cut down international bandwidth usage and give the chance to the ones needing it most," post and telecommunications director general Gatot Dewobroto said on ElShinta radio.

"There are many NGOs in disaster areas such as in Aceh who are depending so much on the Internet for their communications. They are the ones feeling the most impact," Dewobroto said.

Aid workers have been rushing supplies to help the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by floods in northern Sumatra.

Indonesian Internet service providers (ISPs) were meanwhile working to bypass the damaged cables by using a satellite connection.

But regulations which prohibit use of foreign satellites in Indonesia unless reciprocal rights are granted could be a problem, said Sylvia Sumarlin, head of the Indonesian Internet Service Providers' Association.

"It would be wise if the government could permit the providers to gain the rights to use other satellites, in addition to their existing rights to use existing satellites," she told The Jakarta Post.

Indonesian ISPs mostly use Hong Kong-based satellites, she said.

"This is an emergency, if the government fails to do so and sticks to the existing regulation, it will only worsen the situation as it will take at least a month for a multilateral agreement on foreign satellites to be reached," she said.

Sumarlin told the Post her association was still calculating the potential damage caused by the service disruption.

Indonesia has a relatively low rate of Internet access, with an estimated 16 million users out of a population of 220 million.
