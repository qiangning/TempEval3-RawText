Kuwaiti crude oil prices have seen a halt of rising trend by dropping to 53.62 U.S dollars per barrel (dpb) on Monday, 93 cents lower than that of last Friday, local media reported on Tuesday.

Kuwaiti crude oil prices rose by 80 and 96 cents per barrel on last Monday and Tuesday, or on Nov.6 and Nov. 7, to reach 52.88 dpb and 53.84 dpb respectively.

The rising trend emerged when the prices surged up by 59 cents to 54.55 dpb on Friday from Thursday's 53.96 dpb.

Local media attributed the week-long rising trend of oil prices to the effect of Kuwait's output slash which began on Nov.1.

Global crude oil prices hovered below 59 dollars recently amid warm winter concern, which negatively affected the Kuwaiti prices, said local analysts.

With a self-boasted proven oil reserves of about 101.5 billion barrels, Kuwait now produces 2.3 million barrels of crude oil per day.
