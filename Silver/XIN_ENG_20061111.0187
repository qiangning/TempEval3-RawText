The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said here Saturday it airlifted essential supplies to flood-affected communities in Gode Zone of Somali State in response to the recent deadly flash flood in southeastern Ethiopia.

According to a news release from IRC Ethiopia, 18 tons of cooking pots and plates, soap, and blankets were transported to Gode, some 650 km southeast of the capital Addis Ababa, via U.S. military air carrier early on Saturday.

The items will be distributed by the United Nations and other national and international NGOs working on the ground. IRC hopes to send an additional airlift of supplies in the following days.

"Gode Zone is completely cut off by road to the outside world because of the flooding," said IRC Country Director David Murphy.

"We hear reports that there are trucks loaded with emergency relief stranded in the surrounding areas but unable to get through. We're just lucky that we can airlift our emergency relief via the U.S. military."

Sixty-seven people have died and up to 217,000 people have been affected after the Wabe Shebelle river burst its banks after five days of heavy rain. It is not known how many people have been displaced by the latest flash flooding, which occurred ten days ago. It's feared the situation will be further exacerbated with continuing heavy rains.

"This region has already been hit hard. In mid-August, flooding in the same area killed four people and displaced approximately 56, 000," said Murphy. "IRC will do everything it can to support this community."

IRC's emergency intervention is supported by the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.

The IRC serves refugees and communities victimized by oppression and violent conflict worldwide through the provision of emergency relief, post-conflict development, resettlement assistance and advocacy.
