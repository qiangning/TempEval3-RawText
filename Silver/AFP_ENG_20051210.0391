Fiorentina edged struggling Treviso 1-0 on Saturday to move up to second in Italy's Serie A.

Stefano Fiore headed the only goal six minutes into the second half as the Florence club returned to winning ways after their 2-1 defeat at home to leaders Juventus last week which ended their six-match unbeaten run.

Fiore's winner saved the blushes of Serie A's leading scorer Luca Toni whose first half penalty was saved by Adriano Zancope.

After their 15 matches played, Fiorentina have 32 points, seven less than Juventus who entertain Cagliari on Sunday.

Treviso, promoted from Serie B last season, could drop to bottom of the table on Sunday if fellow strugglers Lecce take at least a point from their fixture away to Udinese.

Fiorentina were awarded a penalty on the half hour when Alberto Giuliatto fouled Alessandro Gamberini as a free-kick came into the area.

Toni, who has scored 16 goals this season, stepped up only to see his spot-kick tipped away by Zancope's outstretched fingers.

But the home side made the breakthrough in the 51st minute.

Giampaolo Pazzini exchanged passes with Christian Brocchi before floating a cross to the back post from the right and Fiore headed in from close range.

Treviso had a golden opportunity to equalise for the visitors shortly afterwards but Dino Fava blasted wildly over the bar from a good position.

Siena climbed two places up to 12th after defeating Tuscan rivals Empoli 1-0 in Saturday's early match.

Albanian striker Erjon Bogdani scored the only goal in the second minute, sliding in to stab home Simone Vergassola's low left-wing cross.

Empoli's fourth straight defeat left them in 13th place on 17 points, one behind Siena.
