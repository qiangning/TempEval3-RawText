Global diamond giant De Beers has sold 26 percent of its South African operation to a black- owned consortium for 3.8 billion rand (about 575 million US dollars) in compliance with the country's mining charter.

The company's South African unit, De Beers Consolidated Mines ( DBCM), said on Tuesday that the upfront sale exceeded the 2009 mining charter target, and put the company in immediate compliance with target for 2014.

South Africa's mining charter stipulates that 15 percent of mining companies' units of production, not 15 percent of their assets, has to be black-owned in the medium term, and 26 percent in the longer term.

It is understood that the deal will only affect DBCM, which were split off from the rest of De Beers during the past 18 months of restructuring at the firm, which mines half of the world's diamonds.

De Beers, 45 percent owned by mining giant Anglo American and 40 percent owned by the Oppenheimer family, has been slammed by the government for not having enough black faces in its management.

Lulu Xingwana, deputy minister of minerals and energy, had fiercely criticized De Beers as a "white cartel" that was "looting " South Africa's mineral wealth.

Ponahalo, the company which bought the stake from De Beers, is owned by Mannie Dipico, a former premier of the Northern Cape province and now head of the election committee of the ruling African National Congress.

In terms of the deal, Ponahalo will utilize 10 million rand ( escalating at five percent per year) of its dividend income to make other investments in South Africa, primarily in areas in which De Beers operated with the intent of aiding economic growth and facilitating job creation, said a SAPA news agency report.

Ponahalo is 50 percent owned by current De Beers employees and pensioners while the other 50 percent is held by Ponahalo Investment Holding.

The deal was described by local media as "the most significant change in ownership" in its 117-year history since the Barnato Diamond Mining Company was merged with De Beers in 1888.

Three weeks ago David Noko became the first black person to run De Beers' local operations, taking over from Johathan Oppenheimer, who is the fourth generation of the Oppenheimer family to have managed the business.

But local newspaper The Star on Tuesday pointed out that the black empowerment deal will be "tricky" because five out of the seven local mines are losing money.

Added to this an eight percent royalty on revenues is being contemplated by the government, which De Beers has warned will close mines.

Reacting to De Beers' announcement, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said the deal "sends the right signals in an industry that is seemingly hesitant to wholeheartedly embrace transformation enshrined in the Mining Charter, a document they are signatories to, anyway."

NUM general secretary Gwede Mantashe also noted his union was pleased to see Ponahalo was chaired by Dipico, a former diamond mineworker and NUM shop steward.

"We hope that his experiences will assist in ensuring that this new partnership with De Beers will lead to the betterment of workers and the communities of diamond mineworkers," Mantashe said.
