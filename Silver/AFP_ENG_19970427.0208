Iraq celebrated Sunday after safely flying home Moslem pilgrims in defiance of US-enforced air exclusion zones over the north and south of the country without any retaliation from Washington.

"Helicopters carrying sick and elderly pilgrims arrived Sunday morning in Baghdad, Anbar (in western Iraq), Salahuddin (in the north), and Basra and Zikar (in the south)," the official news agency INA said.

It did not say how many helicopters or passengers were involved.

The helicopters picked up the pilgrims in the southern region of Jodaidat Arar, three kilometres (two miles) from the Saudi border and inside a southern "no-fly" zone.

The flight to Salahuddin, in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, also violates a northern exclusion zone set up shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Iraqi Kurds from air attack by Baghdad.

"Prayers were held in Arar and official celebrations were staged in the provinces attended by political officials," INA said.

Baghdad last week sent nine helicopters to the south to wait for the Iraqis returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.

Iraq said the helicopters were sent to ferry home dozens of elderly and sick pilgrims, in defiance of Washington which imposed the exclusion zone in the south together with London and Paris in 1992 to protect Shiite Moslems.

On Friday Iraq began to take the pilgrims home, violating the northern air exclusion zone by flying to Mosul.

The United States said the southern flights were a "technical" violation and that it would not take military action in retaliation.

But the US Defense Department on Thursday accused Baghdad of seeking to exploit the annual pilgrimage to Islam's holiest sites, known as the hajj, for political ends.

"I think they're trying to hide behind religion or to manipulate the hajj pilgrimage for political reasons," said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. "We're not going to play that game."

Baghdad, which in September said it would no longer recognize no-fly zones, has hailed the flights as a victory.

"Iraq has for years rejected these imaginary lines and announced in its official communiques that it does not recognize the zones because they are not in UN Security Council resolutions," an official spokesman told AFP on Friday.

On April 9, Iraq also flouted the UN sanctions in force since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait and flew more than 100 Iraqis to Saudi Arabia for the start of the pilgrimage.

Iraq insisted that the flight was "purely humanitarian" and so not a violation of the embargo, a position which China, Egypt, France and Russia supported in the UN Security Council.

The United States failed in its efforts to secure UN condemnation of Iraq for the flight to Saudi Arabia.
