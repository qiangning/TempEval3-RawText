Japanese share prices closed up 0.31 percent Wednesday, extending gains after Wall Street's overnight post-Christmas rebound, dealers said.

They said share prices continued to be supported by the strong dollar, which boosts Japanese exporters, and by growing expectations that the central bank will not hike interest rates soon.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 gained 53.96 points at 17,223.15. The broader TOPIX index of all first-section companies rose 4.50 points or 0.27 percent to 1,676.95.

Gaining shares beat decliners 983 to 598, with 130 stocks flat.

Volume rose to 1.66 billion shares from 1.72 billion shares Tuesday.

US stocks rebounded overnight on a sharp drop in oil prices, bringing more holiday cheer to the Tokyo market.

Hideyuki Suzuki, strategist at SBI Securities, said that the market tone remained bullish despite the thin trade at the end of the year with many foreign investors absent.

"Looking at the details, shares which have increased too rapidly were weighed down as investors locked in profits," Suzuki said. "But the blue-chip shares were bullish, leading overall share prices higher."

Hiroaki Hiwada, a strategist at Toyo Securities, said the weakening of the yen against the dollar had supported market expectations about the earnings of exporters.

He said automakers helped drive the market, while steelmakers, a key factor in gains Tuesday, were hit by profit-taking.

Toyota Motor was up 150 yen or 1.9 percent at 7,920 after it confirmed its chief had held talks with struggling US giant Ford amid speculation of a tie-up.

Other auto shares were also higher. Isuzu rose 23 yen or 4.3 percent to 557, Mazda climbed 21 yen or 2.6 percent to 818, Honda Motor advanced 50 yen or 1.1 percent to 4,630 and Yamaha Motor was up 50 yen or 1.4 percent at 3,720.

Steel makers shed on profit-taking. JFE Holdings lost 140 yen or 2.3 percent at 6,090, Sumitomo Metal Industries fell 13 yen or 2.5 percent to 510 and Kobe Steel shed 11 yen or 2.7 percent to 399.
