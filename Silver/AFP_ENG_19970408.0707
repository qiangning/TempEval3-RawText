The State Department said Tuesday it would hold a second round of talks "quite soon" on North Korea's missile exports, to be held at Pyongyang's request.

"The North Koreans have indicated to the United States their willingness to hold a second round of United States-North Korean missile talks very soon," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

"We are currently working on the exact date and location for such a meeting, but I think it will be held quite soon," he said.

The first such talks occurred in Berlin last April. Curbing the spread of North Korean missile technology remains a top US condition before Washington will ease its 47-year-old embargo against Pyongyang.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn will lead the US delegation to the upcoming missile talks, Burns said.
