Hong Kong's key Hang Seng index closed 1.45 percent higher at 19,240.12 points after Thai authorities scaled back capital controls, easing worries of financial instability in the region, dealers said.

Thai stocks had suffered their biggest losses in more than 30 years on Tuesday, shedding 15 percent as panicking investors fled the market after the central bank imposed draconian measures in an effort to halt the rise of Thailand's currency, the baht.
