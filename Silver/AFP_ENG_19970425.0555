Israeli police on Friday found the bodies of two young Jewish women stabbed to death on the West Bank, police sources said.

The bodies of the women, one a 23-year-old Israeli settler, were hidden near a stream in Wadi Kelt close to her settlement of Kfar Adumim, northeast of Jerusalem, they said.

The settler was on an excursion in the desert with a friend.

They were reportedly raped before being stabbed several times in the throat, and the murders were believed to have been carried out between 24 and 48 hours before the discovery of the bodies.

Earlier, police sources identified the victims as two teenage girls who went missing several days ago.

Israeli police and the army supported by helicopters combed the area, as the investigation focused on an attack by Palestinian nationalists while not ruling out rather a criminal act.

The security forces have warned against attacks by Palestinian militants to coincide with this week's Jewish Passover holidays.
