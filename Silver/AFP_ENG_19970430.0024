Thai Prime Minister Chaowalit Yongchaiyudh, who recently divulged that he had been married three times, has admitted to being a womanizer in his youth, The Nation reported Wednesday.

Chaowalit denied allegations of having been married to a fourth woman without the knowledge of the Thai public, but told reporters he had enjoyed a number of short term affairs as a young man.

"I had a lot of those kind of affairs. It was like a moon being surrounded by stars. I could not help it if I was a womanizer when I was young," the newspaper quoted him as saying.

Speculation over Chaowalit's marital history has been rife in the Thai press in recent weeks after an interview with his second wife, whose existence was largely unknown to the general public, was published in a leading newspaper.

Chaowalit and his second wife were married for three years in the 1960s after he divorced from his first wife.

The prime minister said the revelations had not caused any anguish to his current wife, who knew all about his colorful past.

Asked to describe his second wife by reporters, Chaowlait responded: "All women are the same -- they are all lovely."
