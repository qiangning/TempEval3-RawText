Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Saturday tried new generation of anti-helicopter weapons and other military hardware during the ongoing military maneuvers, the official IRNA news agency reported.

Different types of improved anti-helicopter, anti-armor and anti-personnel weapons had been used by the Iranian troops, General Mohammad-Reza Zahedi, commander of the IRGC's ground forces, told a press conference.

The combat capability of these anti-helicopter weapons had been doubled in recent years and they could be used against all types of helicopters, Zahedi said.

Iran's new generation of anti-personnel bullets, which had been used in the war games, could penetrate the most advanced bullet- proof vests, Zahedi said.

The IRGC forces were using modern equipment and tactics to encounter enemies' combat power, the Iranian general said, adding that the IRGC ground forces' weapons could reach as far as 1,400 km into hypothetical enemy's territory.

Zahedi said the war games were intended to show the Iranian military's ability to defend the country against any attack and thereby discourage enemies from inimical contemplation.

The IRGC's 10-day maneuvers, dubbed "The Great Prophet 2," began on Thursday and are to be carried out in the Gulf waters, the Sea of Oman and 14 of the country's provinces.
