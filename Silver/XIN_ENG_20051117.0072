Kobe Bryant scored a season-high 42 points to help the Los Angeles Lakers beat the New York Knicks 97-92 Wednesday night at Staples Center after a three-game loss.

Bryant took a whopping 36 shots, hitting 15, and making 12-of-14 free throws.

"I went after it a little bit more aggressively and the team did a good job looking for me," Bryant said. "I felt we had to get something going in the third quarter."

"It has to be a balance for us," said center Chris Mihm, who scored 14 points and added nine rebound. "Kobe is a special player, but there is no way that he can shoulder the load himself. We played well together in spurts, but Kobe really was the man."

The Knicks were led by rookie Channing Frye with 21 points. Eddy Curry added 17 points.

Stephon Marbury was held to a season-low four points -- 12 below his average, and had 10 assists. He had 45 points last season against the Lakers.

"I have changed a lot of my game," the point guard said. "Forty-five points is so far away. My game is different now."

It was also the first meeting for Phil Jackson and Larry Brown after two of the NBA's greatest coaches began to oversee rebuilding jobs.

"You saw the apparent schizophrenia of these teams," Jackson said. "They play great for a while and then they have trouble operating. What you see is young teams learning to play a consistent game. No quality in the direction of their discipline."

Jackson improved to 26-13 in head-to-head games against Brown, whose Philadelphia team lost to Jackson's Lakers in the 2001 NBA Finals. Brown's Detroit Pistons eliminated the Lakers in the 2004 Finals.

"I admire and respect him, but I have that feeling for anybody that sits down at that end," Brown said. "But you realize what he's done and that's pretty special."

Brown took the New York job, and got off to an 0-5 start before the Knicks won at Sacramento and Utah.
