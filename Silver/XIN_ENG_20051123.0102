About one-third of the pubs, clubs and shops in England and Wales licensed to sell alcohol are to get longer opening hours, a research conducted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) suggested on Wednesday.

Britain's new licensing laws which allow pubs to apply for 24-hour drinking in some areas come into force at midnight Wednesday.

Researchers found 60,326 outlets will now be able to sell alcohol longer. But so far only 359 pubs and clubs get 24-hour licences.

Licensing Minister James Purnell said the new laws would be coupled with the "toughest ever crackdown on alcohol fuelled violence."

A rise in the number of arrests could be a measure of the success of powers in the Licensing Act, he said, adding that premises which sell to underage youngsters including supermarkets will be putting their licence at risk.

"There should be a very clear principle here -- that if people are not causing harm to others, government should get out of their personal lives," said Purnell.

The survey results come after ministers warned that the introduction of more relaxed licensing laws on Thursday is likely to lead to an increase in alcohol related arrests.

But Mark Hastings from the British Beer and Pub Association welcomed the changes.

"We've been saying for a long time that the result of this change would be a relatively modest increase in overall licensing hours, that 24-hour opening was an urban myth, and certainly 24-hour drinking would be an urban myth," he said.

"What we're actually seeing is that at last in this country adults are going to be treated like grown-ups and given a little bit of choice about having a social life beyond 11 o'clock at night," Hastings noted.
