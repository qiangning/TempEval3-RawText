Reigning world number one Bob and Mike Bryan recovered from their lacklustre tournament opener in their Tuesday's Red Group match at Tennis Masters Cup, crashing former top-ranked pair Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor 6-4, 6-4.

Earlier in the day, fifth-seeded Leander Paes of India and Nedad Zimonjic from Serbia and Montenegro claimed their second win in Shanghai, defeating seventh-seeded Australian duo Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley 7-6(3), 7-6 (6) in two hours.

The Bryan twins, two-time defending champions here at the year-ending event of men's professional tennis, took just one hour, 16 minutes and 39 seconds to reannounce their dominance on doubles court and lowered the fourth seeds Knowles and Nestor's hope of making semifinals through the round-robin.

In Sunday's play, both of the pairs have lost their first match in full sets. And according to the competition system made special at this year's Masters, eight elite pairs were devided into Red and Gold Groups with the top two paired finishers qualify for the semis.

Knowles and Nestor have come to Shanghai on a wave of success, winning back to back titles in Vienna and Madrid Masters and going on to reach the final at the Paris Masters just over a week ago.

Unstoppable winning streak of the Bahamian and Canadian pairing, however, was thus snapped by the Bryan brothers, who are the US Open champions and have appeared in 11 tournament finals this year alone.

En route to their comeback victory, the Bryans declined to give any chances to their aged opponents, taking the second round-robin match on 8 aces.

The twin duo from the United States, looking to become the first team to win three straight doubles titles at the season-end champions since Peter Fleming and John McEnroe won the title in seven straight years from 1978-84.

Also they are the second team in 50 years to reach the final in all four Grand Slams. The other pair who set the record are Paes and Indian Mahesh Bhupathi in 1999.
