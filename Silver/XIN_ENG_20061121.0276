UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was shocked at the murder of a senior Lebanese official, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday.

In a statement released by his spokesman, Annan said he was shocked to learn the assassination of Pierre Gemayel, the Minister of Industry of Lebanon and one of the leaders of the March 14 movement, who believed strongly in an independent, democratic and united Lebanon.

The Secretary-General strongly condemns this murder, which happened one day after the Security Council considered the report on the establishment of the special tribunal for Lebanon, Dujarric told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York.

"Such acts of terrorism undermine Lebanon's stability, are unacceptable and have no place in a democratic and open society," Annan was quoted as saying by his spokesman.

"The perpetrators and instigators of today's attack must be brought to justice to ensure an end to impunity," Dujarric said, adding that the UN chief calls upon all parties to maintain national unity at this critical moment.

Gemayel was shot dead on a street in the suburb of Beirut on Tuesday. The 34-year-old Gemayel was a Christian leader in Lebanon and son of former president Amin Gemayel. He was a supporter of the anti-Syrian parliament majority.
