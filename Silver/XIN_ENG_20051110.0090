Iraq condemned on Thursday the three suicide bombing attacks on three hotels in the Jordanian capital of Amman last night which killed at least 57 people and injured hundreds.

"The Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemns the terrorist blasts that took place in three hotels in Jordan," the ministry said in a statement.

The ministry called on the international community "to make every possible effort to uproot terrorism and save humanity from the most evil plague."

The statement stressed Iraq's readiness to actively cooperate with the Jordanian government to relieve the two countries from terrorism.

Iraqi president Jalal Talabani also condemned the bombings.

"Those explosions are another proof that terrorism has become an international plague that should be strongly confronted and defeated by Arab countries and the international community," said Talabani in a statement released by his office.
