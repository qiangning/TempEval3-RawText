A meeting of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany is planned for Tuesday to discuss a United Nations resolution on Iran's nuclear programme, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday, contradicting an earlier statement.

"As a result of the work and efforts undertaken among others by Russia, the meeting of political directors of the six (countries) will take place on Tuesday," Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agencies.

Earlier, Lavrov had been quoted by the news agencies as saying that the meeting had been cancelled due to differences between the six countries.

The so-called P5-plus-one group -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- has been trying for weeks to agree on what sanctions to impose on Iran for its refusal to comply with an earlier UN resolution requiring it to freeze a uranium enrichment program.

Shortly after Lavrov made his first statement the French foreign ministry also said a meeting was still planned for early next week.

While all six states have agreed in principle to impose some sanctions until Iran agrees to suspend the enrichment and enter into negotiations on its nuclear program, Russia and China have balked at the terms of a draft resolution drawn up by Britain, France and Germany.

The United States and its European allies are seeking sanctions under Chapter 7 of the UN charter, which legally obliges all UN members to comply with the punitive measures.

A draft resolution circulated by Britain, France and Germany would have barred trade with Iran in goods related to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and slapped financial and travel restrictions on persons and agencies involved in the sectors.

But Russia and to a lesser extent China, which have extensive economic and energy ties with Iran, have tried to water down the resolution, while Washington, which fears that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear weapons programme, hoped to beef it up.
