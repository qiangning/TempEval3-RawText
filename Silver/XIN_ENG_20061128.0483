Brazil's largest metropolitan region Sao Paulo registered its lowest unemployment rate in October since 1996, a monthly Employment and Unemployment Survey (PED) reported on Tuesday.

The survey was carried out by Sao Paulo state's research institute Seade and the Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Social-Economic Studies.

The current unemployment rate was 14.6 percent, against 16.9 percent in October, 2005. Unemployment has been in a falling trend since June this year. In September, the PED released an jobless rate of 15.3 percent.

Around 94,000 job positions were created in October, 2006. A total of 67,000 citizens found work, which brought the number of unemployed in Sao Paulo down to 1.47 million workers, while 27,000 people entered the region's labor market.

The survey showed that the positive results were closely related to the performance in the service sector, which provided 50 percent of occupations in the metro region, and created 68,000 positions in October, up 1.5 percent from September.

The PED said local industry created 10,000 jobs, while the retail market contributed 23,000, caused by the rise in sales as the year-end holiday approaches.
