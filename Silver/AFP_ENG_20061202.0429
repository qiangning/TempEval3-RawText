Mariska Veres, singer for the Dutch group Shocking Blue who had a worldwide hit with their song "Venus" in 1970, died Saturday aged 59, Dutch media reported.

Veres died from cancer. In 1970 "Venus" reached the top of the American music charts but Shocking Blue did not have any other success that matched their big hit. The group split up in 1974.

Their song "Venus" would go on to make it to number one in the American Billboard chart two more times: in 1981 by cover band Stars on 45 and in 1986 in a version by girlband Bananarama.

In the late 1980s Shocking Blue also served as an inspiration for grunge band Nirvana who covered the band's song "Love Buzz" on their 1989 debut album Bleach.
