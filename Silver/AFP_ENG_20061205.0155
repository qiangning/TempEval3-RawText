South Korean teenager Park Tae-Hwan took aim at a second Asian Games gold medal here Tuesday in the men's 400m freestyle, setting up a final clash with his biggest rival Zhang Lin of China.

Nineteen-year-old Zhang, who lost to Park in the 50m freestyle two days ago, was the fastest qualifier for the final and is out for revenge against the 17-year-old sensation from Seoul.

"There is not much between us. I have beaten him before," said Zhang, who will also face his rival again on Thursday in the 1,500m freestyle.

China-Japan clashes will dominate the eight finals Tuesday with China's coach Zhang Yadong eyeing at least four titles.

In the women's breaststroke Ji Liping, the 50m winner three days ago, is hoping once again to best Japanese challenger Asami Kitajima over 100 metres. Another Chinese medal hope is 13-year-old Wang Qun, who took bronze over one lap.

Wang is being groomed for the 2008 Beijing Olympics as the new Luo Xuejuan, the 22-year-old 100m breaststroke Olympic champion who was left out of the Asian Games squad.

In the men's backstroke Japan's 23-year-old Junichi Miyashita was the fastest qualifier but will be up against China's favourite Ouyang Kunpeng in the final.

In the men's 50m butterfly Japan and China go head to head again with Asian record holder Zhou Jiawei staking a claim for gold with the fastest time in the heats from teammate Wang Dong and Ryo Takayasu from Japan.

China's Pang Jiayang is looking for her third gold in the women's 50m freestyle after her 200m freestyle and 4x400m relay victories.

Pang, 21, the Olympic relay silver medallist, is up against compatriot Xu Yanwei, who shared the 100m relay gold and won an individual silver in the 100m butterfly.

In the relays, Japan look stronger in the men's 4x100 metre freestyle but China's women have the edge going into the 4x200 freestyle.
