Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said on Friday she would push for closer economic and security cooperation in the region as she left here for the 14th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in Hanoi.

Philippines-U.S. strategic alliance against terrorism and poverty would be the focus of her bilateral talk on Saturday with President George W. Bush on the sidelines of APEC, Arroyo told reporters before she boarded the flight.

As chairperson of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN) this year, Arroyo also vowed to "aggressively push for closer economic and security cooperation in the larger Asia- Pacific basin."

The President said she will make a "strong pitch" for the immediate resumption of the stalled World Trade Organization talks and for further discussions on the possibility of establishing a free trade agreement among the APEC member economies.

"I am to make the Philippines a key player in the emerging economic and security synergies of the region, considering our strategic location in the Pacific Rim and the millions of overseas Filipinos whose presence are felt in building and bridging nations across the Pacific," Arroyo said.

President Arroyo left at around 5:30 p.m. Manila time for Hanoi and was expected to meet the Filipino community shortly after her arrival. More than 900 Filipinos are working in Vietnam.
