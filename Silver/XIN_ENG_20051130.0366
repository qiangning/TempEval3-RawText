Slovak police destroyed a network for illegal immigration during an operation on Tuesday, reports from the Slovak capital of Bratislava said Wednesday.

About 240 police officers participated in the operation to break the network suspected of bringing illegal immigrants into neighboring Austria and the Czech Republic, said Slovak Interior Minister Vladimir Palko.

He added that 28 suspects have been accused of running the network, whose members pocketed around 150,000 US dollars in total from their "clients" from Asian countries.

Last year, more than 8,340 illegal immigrants were detained and 272 of their escorts were arrested in Slovakia.
