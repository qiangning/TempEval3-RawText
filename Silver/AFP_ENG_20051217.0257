The Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda on Saturday urged the country's Sunni Arabs not to be fooled by the apparent success of this week's landmark elections.

"We say to our (Sunni) brothers: do not be fooled by what you have heard of the propaganda from the crusaders and their footmen.

"The coming days will show you the fate of this 'democratic marriage' and the marriage of prostitution that it celebrated," the group said in a statement on a frequently used Islamist website.

"Their armed forces (of the Iraqi government) will be useless. Know that the decision of the crusaders to pull out of Iraq has already been taken," reads the statement, whose authenticity could not be verified.

The group, led by Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, is threatening to continue its attacks in Iraq and says it did not halt them during last Thursday's elections for a full-term parliament.

"The Mujahedeen (holy warriors) succeeded in striking the positions of the crusader forces and the apostate government," it said.

On the eve of the election, during which the Sunnis flocked to the polls, the group declared it was launching a large-scale offensive against "the apostate's bastions" in order to disrupt the polls.

However this offensive did not materialise and the rare outbreaks of violence on polling day left four people dead.

Leading Sunni Arab politician Adnan al-Dulaimi on Saturday called for a coalition to protect national unity in a new parliament as he thanked insurgents for not attacking polling stations during the vote.

"The resistance announced it would protect polling stations and not allow a single group to attack them and it respected its promise," he said, referring to another militant group.

"In the name of National Concord Front, we thank them," said Dulaimi referring to the electoral coalition of which he is a leader.
