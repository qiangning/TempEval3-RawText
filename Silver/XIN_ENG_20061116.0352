Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski met here Thursday with his Latvian counterpart Aigars Kalvitis and said after the meeting that it was a meeting of two prime ministers from friendly countries.

Poland and Sweden are the first countries the Latvian prime minister decided to visit after last week's parliamentary elections in Latvia.

"This was a short meeting but I am deeply convinced that together we can achieve a lot," the PAP news agency quoted Kaczynski as saying.

Kaczynski told reporters the talk also focused on energy security, EU relations with Russia and bilateral relations and added that the meeting with Kalvitis was very important both in respect to Polish-Latvian relations and broadly, in the European dimension.

Kalvitis said that the meeting in Warsaw is the beginning of a "further dialogue which is certainly necessary." He believed that possibilities exist in forging good cooperation between Latvia and Poland as well as other European countries.
