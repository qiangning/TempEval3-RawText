Stephen Jackson was suspended by the Indiana Pacers for Monday's game at Chicago after a heated exchange with coach Rick Carlisle, the National Basketball Association club announced Monday.

The veteran guard's banishment came for conduct detrimental to the team in a 107-105 loss Saturday at Cleveland. He was replaced by Darrell Armstrong 2:46 before the end of the first half and let Carlisle know he was unhappy about it.

"I substituted for (Jackson) and he came to the bench and an exchange ensued that I felt was inappropriate, detrimental to the team, so I made a decision to remove him from the bench," Carlisle said.

"As of right now, this is a one-game situation. I expect that this is an incident that is isolated and will be dealt with as such."

Notorious for his role in the riot at Detroit two years ago, Jackson was arrested for allegedly firing a gun outside an Indianapolis strip club in October.

Jackson is averaging 12.3 points and 3.4 assists in 22 games with the Pacers this season, his third with the team.
