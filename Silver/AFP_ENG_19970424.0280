UN Security Council permanent members are to hold a special session Tuesday on efforts to relaunch direct peace talks on this divided island, a UN official announced Thursday.

Gustave Feissel, the UN representative in Nicosia, said that "senior persons" from the United States, Britain, France and Russia would take part in the meeting.

Diplomats said David Cavanaugh, who is in charge of Southeast Europe at the US State Department, Britain's special envoy Sir David Hannay and senior French foreign ministry official Claude Martin would be among those taking part.

"It will provide a good opportunity to review the situation ... and coordinate their own approach to the effort and support" the Security Council, he told reporters after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides.

Feissel told reporters that the permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- would be briefed "about what we have been doing and where things are."

Clerides, who heads the Greek-Cypriot community, and Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have been "willing and able to be available whenever I thought we ought to get together, so I think their attitude has been good," he said.

The United Nations aims to bring together the two leaders, who have not met since October 1994, by mid-1997.

Feissel welcomed the Greek-Cypriot side's decision to suspend overflights by Greek warplanes during war games early next month as a goodwill gesture during his shuttle mediation between Clerides and Denktash.

"I think it's a good step, it shows that there is an effort being made to create the best possible climate to facilitate what we are in the process of doing," the official said.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan last week appointed Diego Cordovez, an Ecuadoran diplomat who helped negotiate the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, as his special adviser on Cyprus.

The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkish mainland troops invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in response to a coup in Nicosia aimed at uniting the country with Greece.
