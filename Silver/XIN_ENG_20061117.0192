Russia and Sri Lanka on Friday signed an agreement on the completion of bilateral talks on Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, Russian news agencies reported.

Russian Economic Development and Trade Minister German Gref and Sri Lankan Minister of Trade, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Jeyaraj Fernandopulle signed the document on behalf of the two sides, Russian WTO negotiator Andrei Kushnirenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Sri Lanka initially was a member of a working group on Russia's accession to the WTO. It was also one of a number of countries that did not make any demands on Russia and thus did not hold any bilateral negotiations earlier.

As Russia's bilateral accession talks are coming to an end, Sri Lanka expressed the hope to conclude an appropriate agreement, mainly to strengthen the terms of tea exports, which accounts for 96 percent of the country's exports to Russia.

Russia still has to sign bilateral protocols with the United States and Costa Rica, with whom the talks have been technically concluded.

According to Russian presidential aide Sergei Prikhodko, Russia is expected to sign an agreement with the United States on its entry into the WTO on Sunday in Vietnam's capital Haoni, where the 14th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Informal Meeting is held on Nov. 18-19.
