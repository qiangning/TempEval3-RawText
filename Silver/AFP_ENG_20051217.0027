Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne outstripped Dennis Lillee's 24-year-old record for most wickets in a calendar year on Saturday when he claimed his 85th and 86th in the first Test against South Africa.

Warne bowled opener A.B. de Villiers for 68 before trapping Ashwell Prince lbw for 28, moving past compatriot Lillee's 1981 haul of 85.

"If I had the choice of picking someone to beat the record, I would've picked Warney," Lillee said earlier. "I just think he's a sensational player.

"He's the best leg-spinner I've ever seen, by a mile, and he's probably the best bowler as well."

Warne, the world's leading Test wicket-taker with 647 in 133 matches, began the year with a five-wicket haul in the final Test against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January on the way to a 3-0 series whitewash.

The 36-year-old then picked up 17 victims in a three-Test tour of New Zealand, but it was the 2-1 Ashes defeat in England that brought him within reach of the record.

He took 40 wickets in the five-Test series at 19.92 and added an average of 27.66 with the bat for good measure.

Warne then claimed six ICC World XI wickets in the one-off Test match at the SCG and 16 West Indian scalps before the South Africa series.

He has eclipsed his previous best years of 72 wickets in 1993 -- in just his second season of Test cricket -- and 70 in 1994 and 2004.
