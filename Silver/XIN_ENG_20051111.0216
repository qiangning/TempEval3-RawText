Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader met his Libyan counterpart, Shukri Ghanem, in Zagreb on Friday and the two leaders pledged to revitalize economic ties between the two countries, the Croatian news agency HINA reported.

Ghanem, secretary of the General People's Committee of Libya, arrived in the Croatian capital Zagreb on Thursday as the first Libyan head of government to visit Croatia.

"While it was a part of Yugoslavia, Croatia particularly developed relations with Libya and Croatian companies were involved in major business projects in Libya. We want this to happen again in the future," Sanader said at a joint press conference after the talks.

"Today there is great interest on Croatia's part, because Libya has launched numerous infrastructure projects, and we want to take part in them," he said.

Croatian construction company INGRA and petrochemical company DIOKI are already present in Libya and many companies want to join them, including shipyards which are interested in building ships for Libya, Sanader said.

The talks also focused on cultural and scientific cooperation.

Ghanem said that his visit was a follow-up to Croatian President Stjepan Mesic's visit to Libya in August 2003.

He said that it was in the interests of both countries to maintain good relations because Croatia could serve as Libya's gateway into Europe and Libya as Croatia's gateway into Africa.

Ghanem said that possibilities for cooperation between Libya and Croatia were great, both on the political and economic level, citing the possibility of creating joint ventures.
