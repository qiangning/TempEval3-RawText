A Singapore court imposed a record fine of 9.25 million Singapore dollars (6.6 million US) on a man who pleaded guilty to smuggling two tonnes of cigarettes from Indonesia, a report said Saturday.

Fong Weng Liong, 42, who was also jailed for two years, will have to serve an additional five years in jail if he cannot pay the fine, the Straits Times reported.

Fong, who is unemployed, smuggled eight consignments, totalling 10,100 cartons, this year before he was nabbed by undercover Customs officers, the court was told.

He had evaded paying duty and tax amounting to 245,329 dollars on the smuggled cigarettes worth 434,300 dollars.

Four other men who assisted the 42-year-old Fong in the elaborate smuggling operation were fined between 3.74 million dollars and 4.9 million dollars each.

Cigarettes are smuggled into Singapore largely because of the disparity in prices of cigarettes sold here and in neighbouring countries, where tobacco taxes are much lower.
