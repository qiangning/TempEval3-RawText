The talks about the term limit of president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo are premature, government officials said on Wednesday, in response to reports saying Arroyo agreed to hold elections for a new parliamentary government in 2007.

The issue of term limit would depend on the transitory provisions of the amended constitution to be ratified by congress as well as the recommendations of the consultative commission, presidential spokesman Ignacio Bunye said in a radio interview.

However, Bunye said that the proposal to shorten the president' s term would be covered by the amended constitution. "The congress must amend the constitution before we proceed to other matters," he added.

Earlier Wednesday, a report quoted an unnamed source as saying that Arroyo made the commitment to former president Fidel Ramos and house speaker Jose de Venecia during a private meeting Monday.

Bunye neither confirmed nor denied the story.

In a press briefing Wednesday afternoon, executive secretary Eduardo Ermita reiterated Arroyo's support of charter change, saying she believes it is the solution to the political crisis.

Arroyo has tasked the consultative commission to submit its recommendation of charter change by Dec. 15, Ermita said.

The proposed amendment may render power to a prime minister as the head of the executive branch, shifting the country's system to parliamentary. Former president Ramos is believed to be the mastermind of the proposal.

The Philippine president enjoys a term of 6 years under the present constitution, which sees Arroyo in her office until 2010.
