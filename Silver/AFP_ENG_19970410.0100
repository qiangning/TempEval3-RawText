The US company EDS on Thursday signed a deal giving it a stake in a Hong Kong firm that is developing the use of electronic transactions between companies, a statement said.

Under the deal, EDS will become an equal partner with three other major shareholders in Transportation Community Network Ltd., which is promoting the use of paperless transactions in Hong Kong through its operator Cargonet.

EDS and CargoNet also agreed on a "strategic alliance" to develop the sector among trade and transport companies in Hong Kong and the neighbouring province of Guangdong, the two firms said in a joint statement.

Electronic commerce service is regarded as the latest area of growth in computer networking.

Under it, companies negotiate, conclude and conduct transactions entirely by computer, something that offers a potentially huge saving in costs.

Companies carry out this business via a data centre operated by the information service provider, which makes its money by charging customers a subscription fee.

"After launching in 1995 and achieving a significant client base in 1996, CargoNet is poised for major growth in 1997," CargoNet chairman Richard Pearson said.

"The whole field of electronic commerce is evolving rapidly, and EDS' commitment and support will help maintain a decisive technological lead."

EDS, a provider of information services, is an independent, publicly- owned company listed in New York and London.

It had income of 14.4 billion US dollars last year, with a payroll of 100,000.

A spokeswoman for CargoNet said she was unable to provide any financial details of the agreement signed Thursday.

The other major shareholders in Transportation Community Network are three local firms: HIT Holdings Ltd.; Kenwa Communication Cp. Ltd.; and CSSL.
