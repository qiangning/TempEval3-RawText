Around two million Muslim faithful were heading Thursday from Mecca to the valley of Mina as the annual hajj pilgrimage got under way in Saudi Arabia amid heavy security.

Draped in white robes, the pilgrims walked or boarded buses to Mina, five kilometers (three miles) east of the holy city of Mecca, to begin tracing the journey made by Prophet Mohammed more than 1,400 years ago.

"Everything is proceeding according to plan," Saudi interior ministry spokesman General Mansur al-Turki told AFP.

Turki said the final number of pilgrims would not be known until the hajj climaxes on Friday, when the faithful move to Mount Arafat where they will spend the day praying and asking for God's forgiveness at the summit, in a symbolic waiting for the last judgment.

More than 1.6 million people from across the world have arrived in Saudi Arabia, and their numbers have been swelled by Saudis and other Muslim residents in the country to above two million.

Over two thirds of the pilgrims are expected to spend the day known as "Yawm at-Tarwiya" at Mina, an optional ritual, while others will head straight to Mount Arafat on Friday, Turki said.

Pilgrims spend the day in prayers and meditation in Mina, sleeping at night in tents before heading further south to Mount Arafat.

Thousands of Saudi security forces have been deployed along the routes to be used by the pilgrims and official media said security and health authorities are mobilized to ensure the safety of the faithful during often risky rituals, with dozens of field hospitals and clinics set up in the area.

The last hajj in January was marred by a deadly stampede which killed 364 people in Mina during a ritual which involves casting stones at pillars representing Satan.

A similar stampede in 2004 saw 251 people trampled to death during the stoning ceremony.

Both tragedies occurred at the entrance to the Jamarat bridge, from where pilgrims cast their stones at three pillars that are supposed to symbolize the powers of evil.

Immediately after the last hajj's stampede, religious leaders ordered the dismantling of the bridge, which created a dangerous bottleneck.

Saudi authorities, who have been fighting a wave of violence by suspected Al-Qaeda extremists since May 2003, have warned that they will crack down on any attempt to undermine security during the hajj.

The warning comes against a backdrop of daily Sunni-Shiite violence in Iraq which has prompted some commentators to express concerns about the risks of a proxy conflict between Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia and Shiite-majority Iran.

Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has insisted on holding a rally during the hajj to denounce Israel and the United States, defying the Saudi ban on political activity during the religious occasion.

Pilgrims will begin moving towards Mount Arafat at dawn Friday. They will then return to Mina to sacrifice an animal, usually a sheep, for Eid al-Adha, the Feast of the Sacrifice, on Saturday.

The pilgrims will spend another two days there for the stoning ceremony that symbolizes a willingness to renounce evil.

The Hajj Commission said Thursday that 252 pilgrims had died of natural causes since arriving in the kingdom this month, generally those suffering from heart problems.

The pilgrimage, which ends on Monday, is one of the five pillars of Islam and is an obligation for all able-bodied Muslims at least once during their lives if they can afford it.
