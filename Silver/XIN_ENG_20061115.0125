Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz Wednesday vowed to revenge an earlier Palestinian militants ' rocket attack that killed a woman in southern Israel, saying the militants behind the attack would "pay a heavy price".

Peretz made the warning in a statement, reported the Qatari al- Jazeera TV channel.

"These organizations will pay a heavy price," the statement said, adding "we will move against those who are involved in the firing of rockets, starting from their leaders and down to the last of their terrorists."

It was reported that Peretz has planned to convene a special meeting of senior security officials later in the day.

An Israeli woman was killed and another man seriously wounded on Wednesday morning as six Qassam rockets, launched from the Gaza Strip, fell in the southern Israeli city of Sderot, local media reported.

One of the rockets landed in a residential area of Sderot, a city adjacent to northern Gaza Strip, killing a 57-year-old woman and critically wounding a 24-year-old man, while several other residents of Sderot were treated for shock, added the reports.

Several Palestinian militant groups, including armed wings of the Islamic Jihad (Holy War) and the ruling Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), have claimed their responsibilities for launching the homemade rockets from northern Gaza Strip at Sderot.

In early November, Israel unleashed a major military offensive into northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, saying the border town was the launching site of numerous rocket attacks against Israel,

Instead of halting rocket firing by Palestinian militants, Israeli artillery shells killed some 19 civilians in Beit Hanoun on Nov. 8, which is the deadliest single attack on Palestinian civilians in the past several years.
