At least one security man died and six others were injured in two separate land mine explosions on Sunday in central Nepal, a local police office said Monday.

"At least one security man died and another was injured when a security patrol overran an anti-government guerrillas planted land mine in Dayagaun area of Kavre district, some 50 km east of Kathmandu," the district police office of Kavre said in a press statement.

Meanwhile, five others of the same patrol team were injured in another explosion at Chaukidanda area of the district, the press statement said.

At the same day, security forces and guerrillas clashed at Sapsu Khola area of Khotang district, some 200 km east of Kathmandu.

"However, in the 45-minute long clash, no casualties were reported on either side," said Ramesh Thapa Magar, chief of Indra Dhwoj Army Battalion.

Over 12,000 Nepalese people have been killed since the anti- government insurgency took place in the Himalayan kingdom in February 1996.
