India's Leander Paes and Sania Mirza combined to win gold in the tennis mixed doubles at the Asian Games on Wednesday.

The pair defeated seventh seeds Satoshi Iwabuchi and Akiko Morigami from Japan 7-5, 5-7, 6-2.

They won bronze together at the 2002 Asian Games.

Paes returned to the court for the gold medal match just minutes after winning the men's doubles title with team-mate Mahesh Bhupathi.

Mirza won silver earlier in the day, losing to China's Zheng Jie in the women's singles final.

Taiwan's Lu Yen Hsun and Hsieh Su Wei and China's Yu Xinyuan and Sun Tiantian share bronze.
