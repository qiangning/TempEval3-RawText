Most New Yorkers believe that construction should continue while an expanded search for human remains underway, according to a recent poll conducted by local media.

About 54 percent of the 1,500 registered voters argued that construction of the Freedom Tower and other buildings in the site should proceed while 39 percent think it should stop until the search for remains is complete.

The search for human remains resumed last month when a power supply crew came upon remains while doing routine work in a manhole. So far, more than 200 remains have been found, leading some to believe the original search was not extensive enough.

One respondent said he believed the construction should keep going and stick to the plan, as it will take a long time to actually to uncover everything. But another believed the workers should stop because they keep finding bones from people. "Out of respect for the people who died here, I think they should stop the construction and do a full, thorough search," he added.

Some criticized the authorities for failing to do a better search before they started building, but the poll found that 47 percent were happy with the original search while 42 percent wish more had been done.
