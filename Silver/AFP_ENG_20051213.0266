RAG, the German energy and mining group, wants to increase its stake in specialty chemicals maker Degussa to 100 percent or it will sell its current majority, RAG chairman Werner Mueller said in a newspaper interview released on Tuesday.

"Either we take it over fully or we'll sell our stake completely," Mueller told the daily Die Welt in a pre-release of an interview to be published on Wednesday.

RAG currently holds a stake of 50.1 percent in Degussa, with further 43 percent owned by energy giant E.ON.

But E.ON wants to sell its stake and is currently negotiating with RAG over a billion-euro (dollar) deal.

"The only thing that is certain is that E.ON wants to sell. How they will do so or whether we're the buyer has not yet been decided," Mueller said.

Asked whether RAG was in a position to finance such a deal, Mueller replied: "We're not going to commit some sort of financial 'harakiri'. We can do this deal if we want to."
