Four hostages were shown on a video released by an insurgent group in Iraq, the al-Jazeera reported on Tuesday.

The previously little known group, calling itself the Swords of Righteousness, said the four peace activists were spies working for occupying forces.

The hostages were shown sitting on the ground and one passport was also shown on the video which seemed to belong to a British national.

Meanwhile, two Iranian Shiite pilgrims and an Iraqi female guide were released north of Baghdad shortly after they were taken hostage by gunmen Monday night.

Insurgents often kidnap foreigners in an attempt to force the occupation forces to pull out. Some hostages were killed and many released, in some cases after ransoms paid.
