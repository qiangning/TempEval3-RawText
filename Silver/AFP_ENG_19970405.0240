German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has blasted Ankara for its fierce criticism of Germany following a fire there in which three Turkish people died that was initially blamed on racists.

Kinkel told the weekly Welt am Sonntag to be published Sunday that "megaphone diplomacy conducted in the gutter" could only "destroy relations nurtured over a long period."

He also called on Ankara not to exacerbate difficulties in German- Turkish relations.

The Turkish press and government reacted furiously to the fire, which occurred on March 31 in the western city of Krefeld, plunging Turkish- German relations to a new low.

A 41-year-old woman, her 19-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son were killed in the blaze.

On Thursday an angry exchange between the two countries reached a peak when Turkish Interior Minister Meral Aksener accused Germany of trying to "burn" Turks out of the country.

However investigators found no evidence of a racist or political motive for the deadly blaze, and on Friday the woman's husband, Aziz Demir, 42, was arrested and charged over the incident.

Police said he was apparently angry that his wife was planning a divorce.

Kinkel stressed that Turkey and Germany were "very important partners for each other" and said that Turks were living in Germany as "well- regarded fellow citizens."

"We are a country that likes foreigners," he said.

German legislators also criticised Ankara.

Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, a deputy of the Free Democratic Party, warned that Turkey's "premature" judgement could have negative consequences for relations between the two countries.

In an interview in the daily Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung on Saturday she said that politicians should "watch their language."

Cem Ozdemir, a member of parliament for the opposition Greens party who is of Turkish origin, told the weekly Bild am Sonntag that Ankara's reaction "not only damages official relations between Germany and Turkey" but also "puts pressure on daily life" between members of the two communities.
