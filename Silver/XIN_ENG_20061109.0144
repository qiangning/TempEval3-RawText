International relief agency Oxfam warned Thursday that unchecked climate change could deal a crippling blow to a way of life that has existed for centuries because more frequent and intense droughts are threatening the livelihoods of pastoral communities.

In a statement issued here Thursday, Oxfam appealed to the delegates attending the ongoing United Nations conference on climate change to save the lives of pastoral communities such as the Turkana of northern Kenya.

"Governments meeting at the UN climate change conference in Nairobi only have to look to a few hundred miles north to see how climate change is having an immediate and devastating effect on people's lives," said Antonio Hill, senior policy adviser of Oxfam.

"Under threat is the way of life of pastoral communities. People such as the Turkana are on the front line of the injustice of man-made climate change. They are least responsible for climate change but are amongst the worst affected," said Hill.

Oxfam called on governments at the UN climate change conference to significantly increase funds to help the poorest and most vulnerable adapt to climate change and to agree on an accelerated timetable for binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The latest report from the Kenyan meteorological office, released at the Nairobi climate change conference, shows that the northern regions have seen a steady decline in mean annual rainfall over the last 50 years.

Pastoral communities, which rely heavily on natural resources and their livestock, have over centuries developed a way of life that has coped with the vagaries of the climate, even severe droughts.

However Oxfam says more frequent extreme weather means it is more difficult for them to recover after each incidence of drought.

According to the Kenyan government, pastoral communities have suffered most due to recent climate extremes in the country.

The east African nation is used to extreme weather patterns but they are becoming more frequent and intense. The 1999 to 2000 drought was the worst in living memory and was followed by a severe drought in 2004 to 2005.
