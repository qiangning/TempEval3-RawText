Shinobu Ono scored the only goal to give Japan women's team a 1-0 win over Australia on Sunday in a warm-up soccer match for the Asian Games next month in Doha.

The decisive goal came in the 51st minute when Yuki Nagasato sent a cross into the area, which Ono fired in with a right-footed shot.

The Japanese women missed good chances afterwards, but they showed tight defence to fend off the Australian attacks.

Japan will play Germany in another warm-up game next Thursday before heading to the Asian Games a week later.
