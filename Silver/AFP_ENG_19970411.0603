Gerhard Schroeder would lead the social democratic SPD party to victory if he were selected to face Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next year's general elections, according to an opinion poll published Saturday.

Schroeder, who heads the state government in Lower Saxony, would win 56 percent of the vote against 33 percent for Kohl, the poll, conducted by the DIMAP institute and published by the daily Bild, indicated.

With Oskar Lafontaine as its champion, the SPD would lose with 40 percent of the vote against 45 percent for Kohl's CDU Christian- Democratic Union, according to the poll in which 1,100 people were questioned.

Kohl would win by an even bigger margin - 47 percent - against an SPD led by Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the SPD's parliamentary group whom only 36 percent of those questioned said they would back.

The SPD leadership said on April 3 that Kohl's decision to run for chancellor again would not affect its decision to wait until next year to pick its own candidate for the country's top post.

Asked how they would vote if the elections took place this week, 41 percent of those polled said they would vote SPD (plus one percent) and 35 percent said they would back the CDU.
