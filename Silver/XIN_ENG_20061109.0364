Zambian national team coach has named a 19-member squad for the Confederation of East and Central African Football Association (CECAFA) championship that will start this month in Ethiopia.

According to the list released here Wednesday by Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) Patrick Phiri has blended experience and new talent in his team, bringing in players from both the Under 20 and Under 23.

The championship that will also feature Malawi and the host Ethiopia will run from November 25 to December 10.

FAZ spokesperson Joseph Nkole said: "We are taking this championship seriously because it would help our players to prepare for the Ghana 2008 Africa Cup qualifiers early next year."

Nkole said FAZ decided to include the Under 20 players in the team to shape them up for the Africa Youth Championship next year.
