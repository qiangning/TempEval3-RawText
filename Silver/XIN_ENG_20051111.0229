Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Per Stig Moeller on Friday condemned the bombings against three hotels in Amman, Jordan, Ritzau News Bureau reported.

"Once again, we see that terrorists have brought their contempt for human life to bear on innocent people," Moeller said. "These kinds of acts can in no way be justified."

Moeller said that the bombings would not prevent him from visiting Jordan on Sunday as part of a series of visits in the Middle East.

Moeller pointed out that terrorists had become increasingly more brazen in their methods.

"And that highlights the importance of continuing to strengthen international cooperation in the fight against terror," he said.

The foreign minister also said that Jordan was one of the Middle-Eastern countries that was doing most to implement reforms.

"It is characteristic that terror attacks have been targeted against reformers in the Middle East, such as Jordan. Therefore it is vital that we continue to expand our cooperation and dialogue with Middle-Eastern countries," Moeller said.
