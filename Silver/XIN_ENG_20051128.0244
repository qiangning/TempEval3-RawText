GAZA, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- Fatah primaries in the Gaza Strip were suspended due to riots and violations, a poll official announced on Monday.

Ibrahim Abu Najja, chief of the highest committee of Fatah primary elections, announced the suspension following severe violations occurred at several polling stations across the Gaza Strip on Monday.

"These violations made the continuation of the whole process impossible," Abu al-Najja told reporters after a meeting of the committee.

Palestinian militants stormed several polling stations in the cities of Deer al-Balah, Khan Younis and Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip, and ordered voters to go away.

Dozens of Fatah members burned tires and voters lists after failing to find their names in the lists.

Earlier, Palestinian sources said that the committee decided to postponed Fatah primaries in the central Gaza Strip following riots at the ballot stations in this region.

The ongoing primaries are to choose candidates of the dominant Fatah movement to stand in the legislative elections set for Jan. 25, 2006.
