Tourists arriving on foot, by bicycle or on horseback will be offered five new places to cross the border between Hungary and Austria, the spokesman of the border control authority told MTI on Thursday.

The new crossing points at Pornoapati, Ronk, Szentgotthard, Agfalva and Harka, opening on Friday, will be open during the day, said Ivan Kovacs.

He added that another crossing point is scheduled to open at Fertorakos next year, and negotiations with Austria are currently underway on a further 10 tourist crossing stations.
