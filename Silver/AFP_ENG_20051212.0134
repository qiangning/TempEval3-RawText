NATO troops in Bosnia on Monday raided the home of a supporter of top Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic in a bid to track down the fugitive, a spokesman said.

The soldiers conducted a search of the Pale residence of Dragan Stajcic, who was "suspected to be a close associate of Radovan Karadzic and part of his support network," said Derek Chappell.

"The search was conducted in an effort to find additional information on Karadzic's movement, whereabouts and to gather information about (his) support network," said the NATO spokesman.

Chappell said the aim of the operation was to disrupt and put pressure on the support network of Karadzic, the political leader of Bosnian Serbs during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war.

Stajcic was a former director of Radio Sveti Jovan (St. John), the station owned by Karadzic's daughter Sonja that was recently closed down after frequent NATO raids.

The operation comes five days after a high-profile Croatian war crimes suspect, former general Ante Gotovina, was arrested in Spain after four years on the run.

Gotovina's arrest raised the pressure on authorities in Bosnia's Serb entity and neighbouring Serbia-Montenegro to bring about the arrests of Karadzic and his wartime military chief Ratko Mladic, who were both indicted by The Hague-based UN war crimes tribunal more than 10 years ago.

The two are wanted on charges including genocide over the 43-month siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre of an estimated 8,000 Muslim males, the single worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.

Both remain at large despite bounties of five million dollars for information leading to their arrest offered by the United States.

Karadzic is thought to spend his time in either Bosnia or across the border in Montenegro and Mladic is widely believed to be hiding in Serbia.

NATO has failed in repeated efforts to capture Mladic and Karadzic, who remain heroes to nationalist Serbs.
