US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright regretted Tuesday a decision by the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva to kill a US-backed motion criticizing China's human rights record.

But in a broad speech at the US Naval Academy here, Albright defended the Clinton administration's decision three years ago to separate criticism of Beijing's human rights record from renewal of its US trade privileges.

"Earlier today, the UN Human Rights Commission decided not to consider a resolution we had co-sponsored that would have urged China to improve its human rights practices. We regret that decision," Albright said.

"We congratulate the government of Denmark for sponsoring that resolution and the others who co-sponsored it," she said.

The United States believes "that human rights are a legitimate subject for discussion among nations. On this, we differ with China," Albright said.

"But we also differ with those who believe that the way to improve human rights conditions in China would be to deny that country the trading status we accord to most others."

Economic openness and political liberalization, she said, "reinforce each other."

China's reputation was further tarnished this year as a result of allegations that it sought to illegally channel campaign money last year to the coffers of congressional candidates.

Renewal of most favored nation trade status for China is virtually certain, although this latest scandal makes it less certain, analysts say.

The Human Rights Commission passed a China-backed "non-action" motion in Geneva on Tuesday, allowing Beijing to evade a Danish-backed censure motion on its human rights record scheduled for debate later in the day.

This effectively kills a Danish motion criticizing Chinese human rights violations that had been supported by the United States, the Netherlands and others.

It was the seventh time that western countries had presented a motion on China's human rights record to the UN Human Rights Commission. This year, however, they were sharply divided on the issue.

Previous attempts to censure China have been defeated by the "non- action" ploy on every occasion except in 1995. No rights motion against China has succeeded since Beijing's bloody crackdown on student protests in Beijing in 1989.
