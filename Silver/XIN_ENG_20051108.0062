The Ugandan government has issued a license to a private firm, Job Potential and Property Markets ( JPPM) to recruit Ugandans who want to work abroad.

An official from the External Employment Unit (EEU) in the Ministry of Labor, Nava Nabagesera was quoted by local media on Tuesday as saying that the license issuance to JPPM brought a new era for Ugandans who will now be able to work without fear of being deported.

"A number of companies applied, we verified the requirements of the companies and among them was that they had to have over fifty jobs ready. They can start work and what remains for us is to supervise and monitor them. It is a big break through as Ugandans will not have to work under pressure. It will help build the economy," said Nabagesera.

JPPM's Managing Director, Paul Muhumuza said they were ready for recruitment.

"We are going to recruit people for professional and casual jobs. We have already signed agreements with different corporate bodies and were only waiting for the license to start work. Now that we have been licensed, we are going to start the recruitment.

He said their target so far was Britain, the United States, South Africa, Canada and China, which is in need of English teachers.

"We have about 15,000 jobs and the gates are open. We will be getting particulars of personalities, train them and process the papers including work permits and visas. We will then connect then to factories and other corporate companies," said Muhumuza.

In August this year, the Ugandan government launched the EEU to help Ugandans officially get jobs outside the country.

The move followed an increase in the number of unemployed youths in the country. Recent statistics indicate that at least 10, 000 students graduate annually from universities and other institutions of higher learning in the country but cannot access jobs.
