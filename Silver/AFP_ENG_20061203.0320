Crashed US pilot Major Troy Gilbert whose F-16 fighter went down in Iraq last week was officially listed as killed in action by the US air force on Sunday.

The pilot had been described as "duty status and whereabouts unknown" but following DNA tests made on remains found at the crash site this was changed to "killed in action", the military said in a statement.

US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver, said: "Based on the remains found, the air force is confident of its classification ... We have some remains now from the crash site but we are still looking for more."

Gilbert was supporting US ground troops some 32 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Baghdad on November 27 when his plane crashed for reasons that are currently under investigation.

It took ground forces several hours to reach the crash site at which an insurgent presence was detected by other US aircraft.

A US military official told AFP at the time that the major's body was missing and was presumed to have been taken by insurgents.
