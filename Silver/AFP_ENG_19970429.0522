Former congressman Douglas "Pete" Peterson, who spent six and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp, was sworn in Tuesday as Washington's first ambassador to Hanoi.

Peterson took the oath of office at a State Department ceremony attended by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a US official said.

He is scheduled to arrive in Hanoi on May 9.

Peterson's confirmation "sends a very strong message that it is important to put the war behind us and get on with a friendly relationship," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

Burns said the new ambassador will "try to heal the wounds" of the Vietnam War that ended in communist victory in 1975. The conflict claimed the lives of about three million Vietnamese and nearly 60,000 Americans.

But the State Department also put Hanoi on notice that Peterson will press Washington's view that human rights should be upheld by the Vietnamese government.

"We encourage US investment in Vietnam but it is still a communist country and we are disturbed by human rights problems there," Burns said.

"We intend to make it (human rights) part of the relationship," he added.

The US Senate approved Peterson's appointment on April 10 after a lengthy delay due to lingering Republican opposition to Washington's restored ties with former enemy Vietnam.

Republican lawmakers also questioned the constitutionality of the appointment as Peterson served in Congress when the decision to open an embassy in Hanoi was made, thus raising conflict of interest issues.

Even after those issues were resolved, Republican Senator Bob Smith, a staunch opponent of President Bill Clinton's 1995 decision to normalize relations with Vietnam, again sought to delay his despatch to Hanoi.

"We are delighted that he is sworn in after such a long wait," Burns commented. "He is a terrific choice," he added, stressing his experience as a prisoner of war.

Peterson was the 66th American taken prisoner during the bitter conflict.
