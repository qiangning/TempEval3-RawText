The United States and Colombia signed a trade promotion agreement Wednesday, eliminating tariffs and other barriers to trade in goods and services between the two countries.

Still, the agreement, signed at InterAmerican Development Bank in Washington by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative John Veroneau and Colombian Commerce Minister Jorge Humberto Botero, will require a final approval by the U.S. Congress.

"The agreement will deepen and strengthen our trade ties by providing new opportunities for U.S. businesses, manufacturers, farmers and ranchers to export their goods and services to one of Latin America's most robust economies," said Veroneau in a statement.

"For Colombia, this agreement will provide permanent access to the U.S. market, which will aid in sustaining real growth, creating more jobs, and attracting new investment," Veroneau said.

Colombia is currently the 31st largest U.S. goods trading partner. In 2005, U.S. goods exports to Colombia totaled nearly 5. 5 billion dollars. Two-way goods trade between the two countries during 2005 amounted to 14.3 billion dollars, according to the statement.

The statement said that many products from Colombia already enter the U.S. market duty-free under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) which expires on Dec. 31, 2006. This new agreement helps Colombia to expand its current access and lock in duty-free treatment for Colombian products.

Building on ATPA, the agreement will ensure that U.S. products exported to Colombia likewise benefit from duty-free treatment, the statement said.
