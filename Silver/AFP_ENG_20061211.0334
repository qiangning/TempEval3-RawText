A Ugandan court on Monday acquitted a Ugandan-born Australian physician of murdering his estranged lawyer wife last year at the end of a long-running high-profile trial.

Kampala High Court Justice Opio Aweri said prosecutors had failed to prove their case against Aggrey Kiyingi, 51, a Sydney cardiologist, who had vehemently denied any role in the July 2005 killing of his wife, Robinah.

The judge also found two other suspects in the murder -- a police officer and a businessman, along with a soldier who was later found dead in prison -- not guilty in the shooting death of Robinah Kiyingi, a well-known Kampala attorney.

"Taking the prosecution evidence in totality, my mind is left nagging," Aweri said. "The evidence was not established and court needs to be certain beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence to convict the accused persons."

"I find the accused persons not guilty of the offence and they are accordingly acquitted," he said, adding that while Kiyingi may have been the prime suspect "suspicion alone cannot a basis on which to convict a person."

The suspects could have faced the death penalty if convicted.

Kiyingi, 51, was arrested after attending the funeral of his 54-year-old wife, a prominent anti-corruption advocate, who was shot several times in her car in the driveway of her home.

He and the co-defendants had been accused of conspiring to have Robinah Kiyingi killed.

The trial had been filled with surprise allegations and witness testimony, as well as the death in custody of the accused soldier.

Last month, Ugandan trial "assessors," who function like jurors but whose rulings are not binding on the court, recommended that Kiyingi be acquitted, citing insufficient evidence.
