The World Bank predicted on Tuesday that China's current account will post a surplus of 223 billion U.S. dollars this year, a drastic rise from last year's 160 billion U.S. dollars.

The figure is expected to take up 8.5 percent of China's gross domestic product, said the Washington-based group in its latest mid-year update on East Asia.
