The Security Council expansion should give priority to increasing the representation of developing countries in the United Nations' most powerful organ, particularly African nations, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Wang Guangya stressed on Thursday.

Addressing the UN General Assembly, Wang reaffirmed China's support for necessary and rational reform of the council, including its expansion and the improvement of its working methods, in order to maintain its authority, increase its efficiency and strengthen its role.

He pointed out that the council expansion should be in line with the democratization trend of international relations and give priority to enhancing the representation of developing countries.

"Democratization of international relations is a global trend, which should also find its reflection in the Security Council," he said. "While developing countries account for more than two thirds of the entire UN membership, they are seriously under-represented in the Security Council."

China holds that the council expansion should give priority to augmenting the representation of developing countries in general and African countries in particular, and increase opportunities for more countries, particularly small and medium-sized countries, to participate in the council's decision-making process, Wang noted.

"A reform package that addresses only the concerns of a few states while disregarding those of the majority and treats African and other developing countries inequitably will lead to nowhere," he warned.

Wang also emphasized that the council enlargement should adhere to the principle of equitable geographical distribution and ensure the representation of different cultures and civilizations.

He reiterated China's opposition to imposing an artificial deadline for the council expansion or forcing any expansion proposal through the General Assembly by putting it to a vote.

"The council reform should be based on democratic discussion with a view to reaching the broadest possible consensus. No artificial deadline should be set, nor should a vote be imposed," he said.

"Only when this approach is followed can the relevant decisions command the widest possible trust and support, and meet the common long-term interests of all member states," he added.

The Security Council is currently composed of five veto-holding permanent members -- China, the United States, Russia, France and Britain -- and 10 elected members with two year terms. A fierce debate over the council expansion before the September UN summit failed to produce any agreement.
