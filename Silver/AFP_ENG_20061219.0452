Benni McCarthy has praised UEFA for dishing out a five-match ban to Wisla Krakow's Nikola Mijailovic, the Serbian defender who was found guilty of racially abusing him during a UEFA Cup match in October.

"I was pleased with the way the situation was handled," Blackburn's South African forward said.

"Every club and every league is against racism - and football is trying hard to fight against it, but you still get people - players, coaches or fans - who will use offensive terms.

"Sport should unite people, not divide them, so I am glad an example was set."

McCarthy, speaking to www.fifa.com, added: "Maybe the next person who is considering using a racist term during a match will think twice."

Blackburn's South African striker Benni McCarthy has admitted he has found life in the Premiership tougher than he had expected.

McCarthy, who joined Blackburn in a 2.5-million-pound summer transfer from FC Porto, admitted he was finding English football physically challenging, although his nine goals in a struggling side suggest he has not had that many problems adapting.

"It's so physically demanding and every game is like a cup final," he said. "I've played in Holland, I've played in Spain, I've played in Portugal, and not every game is so fast and so difficult.

"Even if you're playing against the bottom team in the league, it's as difficult as playing Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea. In Holland, Spain and Portugal only a few teams made you really work hard and concentrate for 90 minutes. Here you have to be in top form in every game."

The 29-year-old also revealed that he had been drawn to Blackburn because of his admiration for manager Mark Hughes, a Manchester United star when the South African was growing up.

"He used to be my hero," said McCarthy. "He was a player who I always wanted to be like. I have so much respect for him - and I love learning from him.

"It's a little bit strange actually because I have gone from being a big fan to standing next to him on the training pitch.

"In South Africa I used to watch a lot of English football - everyone likes to see winning teams and I think that's why I adopted Manchester United. I used to know everything about them, but now I'm Blackburn through and through.

"I couldn't have come to a better club. It may be a smaller club than United, but it has a big heart. I'm feeling loved and very welcome."
