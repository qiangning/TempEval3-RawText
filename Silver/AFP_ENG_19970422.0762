Share prices were higher on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Wednesday morning, but with profit-taking capping the upside, brokers said.

The Nikkei stock average rose 160.02 points, or 0.9 percent, to end the session at 18,704.47, down from a session high of 18,782.08.

Investors turned sellers among banks toward the end of the session and took profits on recent gains, brokers said.

"It is understandable to see such modest profit-taking among banks following their recent sustained gains," said a broker at New Japan Securities Co. Ltd.

The dollar was quoted at 126.45-47 yen in late morning trading, up from 126.32 yen in New York late Tuesday and from 126.02-05 yen here late Tuesday.
