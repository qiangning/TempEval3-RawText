Outgoing UN chief Kofi Annan on Tuesday praised Spain for donating 700 million dollars (550 million euros) to help the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aimed at halving extreme poverty around the world by 2015.

"This is the largest contribution yet made to the UN for this purpose by any country, and I believe it is a splendid example of international solidarity which I hope other members will follow," Annan told a press conference, his last before he steps down on December 31 after 10 years in office.

Annan was on hand along with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero at a signing ceremony for the donation here Monday.

The deal, signed between Spanish Secretary of State for International Cooperation Leire Pajin and Kemal Dervis, the UN Development Program (UNDP) Administrator, sets up the UN Fund for the Achievement of the MDGs, which will be managed by Spain and UNDP.

The MDGs call for 500 million people to be "lifted out of extreme poverty" in the next decade, putting 115 million children put in school, and halting the spread of HIV/AIDS.
