A major human rights exhibition kicked off in China's capital on Friday, showcasing the country's efforts to protect human rights.

The ten-day exhibition, the largest of its kind ever held in Beijing,features more than 700 pictures, 250 legal documents, 330 books on human rights and 24 diagrams, which "truthfully record China's efforts to promote and safeguard the people's right to life and right to develop and, more broadly, their political, economic, social and cultural rights," organizers said.

"We hope the exhibition will give people a more comprehensive and objective understanding of human rights in China, a clearer picture of how human rights have developed in the Chinese context and more confidence in China's commitment to human rights as it builds a socialist harmonious society," said Cai Wu, director of the Information Office of the State Council, at the opening ceremony of the exhibition at the Museum of Nationalities.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It is also 15 years since China issued its first white paper on human rights.

"The exhibition reflects China's recognition of and respect for the UN bill on human rights and basic international human rights principles," Cai said.

"Adhering to the principle of respecting and safeguarding human rights, and promoting the progress of human rights, are important governing concepts in China," he said.

"I believe the exhibition will help promote human rights in China and boost exchanges between China and the outside world," said Dong Yunhu, vice chairman of the China Society for Human Rights Studies.
