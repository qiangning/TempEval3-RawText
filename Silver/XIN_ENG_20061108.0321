Two Los Angeles investors submitted a bid Wednesday to buy one of the largest media groups in the United States, which publishes major newspapers like the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and New York's Newsday.

Affiliates of Billionaire Eli Broad and prominent investor Ron Burkle's companies "have submitted a competitive bid for acquisition of the entire Tribune company", the Los Angeles Times reported at its website, quoting a source familiar with the offer.

How much the two businessmen would be willing to pay for the Chicago-based media company and the details about their offer remained unclear, but they have said for months that they wanted a local group to take control of the Los Angeles Times, according to the newspaper.

The offer came a day after it was reported that the Times' editor Dean Baquet would leave his post because of a long-standing dispute with the paper's Chicago parent company over proposed staff reductions.

Meanwhile, famous Hollywood entertainment mogul David Geffen has also expressed interest in acquiring the Los Angeles Times. Geffen was not known to have submitted an offer so far.

All three of the potential buyers have said in the past that the Los Angeles Times would benefit from their stewardship because they would be willing to accept lower profits and invest in news coverage.

Tribune executives earlier said they preferred to keep the Times as part of their media conglomerate, which includes 10 other daily newspapers and 25 television stations across the company.

However, the company last week opened itself to bids on individual newspapers after it received a series of low bids from several private equity firms for the company.

Local groups and individuals have expressed interest in acquiring Tribune papers after the company announced in late September that it would seek a sale or breakup of the company.

The company faces many of the challenges confronting the traditional media industry, as the circulation of newspapers has been on the decline and advertisers have been shifting their spending to the Internet.
