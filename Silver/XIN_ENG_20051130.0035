US Ambassador to Japan Thomas Schieffer said Wednesday the presence of American troops in Japan ensures the safety of its ally.

"In the last 60 years Japan has been at peace, and the world has been spared another World War. The large part of the reason for that success lies in the presence of US troops here in Japan," he told a press conference, saying the troops' presence had helped Japan in building itself into the No. 2 economy in the world.

While defending the US military realignment in the country and responding to long-standing Japanese grievances about burdens as host, he played down the US role in influencing Japan's foreign policy in handling relations with Asian neighbors.

He said Japan and the United States acting together will create "powerful force for good in Asia and the world."

"I think if we increase the capability of US forces, we increase the security in Japan," Schieffer said.

Japan and the United States agreed recently on an interim security report which enables smoother military cooperation between them.

The agreement are being fiercely opposed by governments and communities in regions hosting US forces.

Schieffer reminded the Japanese who complain about the burden that it is the United States that has "born a heavy burden" in the alliance.

He said the United States, in real dollars, are spending 10 time as much as Japan on defense.

When asked about the US role in influencing Japan's foreign policy in Asia, Schieffer said Washington has no "direct role" in these affairs and is not the "final arbitrary" in the dispute between Japan and its Asian neighbors.

Japan's political relations with China and South Korea are on the rocks because of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's repeated visits to the war criminal-honoring Yasukuni Shrine as well as other history-related issues.

After his meeting with US President George W. Bush on Nov. 16, Koizumi said if Japan keeps close relationship with the United States, its ties with Asian countries will go better.

As for the US attitude toward tuning Japan's Self-Defense Forces into an army stated by a constitutional revision, Schieffer said it rests with Japan's own decision.
