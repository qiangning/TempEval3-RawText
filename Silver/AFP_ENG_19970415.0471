A nationwide poll has indicated that India's main opposition party of Hindu nationalists would be elected to power if fresh elections were held now, the United News of India said Tuesday.

The poll, conducted between April 2 and 8 across 16 of India's 25 states, predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party, BJP) and its allies would get between 237 and 253 seats in the 545-seat parliament.

More than half of the 13,000 registered voters interviewed said they preferred mid-term polls instead of a new coalition government.

India's United Front alliance, ousted in a parliamentary vote of confidence last week after its estranged ally, the Congress (I) party suddenly withdrew support after 10 months, would suffer in fresh elections, the poll indicated.

India's 545-seat lower house is almost evenly split between the BJP, the single largest party with 162 seats, the Congress and the United Front, an alliance of 13 leftist, centrist and regional parties.

The BJP and its allies need about 70 additional members to form a government on their own.

The poll said the Front would get between 150 and 164 seats, a "1.1 percent negative swing," while the Congress would only win between 112 and 126 seats against its current position of 139.

India's political crisis, however, ended Tuesday with the Congress pledging to support a new Front-led alliance under a new leadership.

The party withdrew support from the Front on March 30, accusing Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda of pandering to Hindu nationalists and accusing him of incompetence.

Deve Gowda has offered to step down to regain Congress backing for the Front and prevent mid-term elections but the BJP favours polls, saying any fresh coalition government would not last more than six months.
