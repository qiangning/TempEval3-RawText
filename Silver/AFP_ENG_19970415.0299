US consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in March, following a 0.3 percent increase in February, the Labor Department said Tuesday.

Analysts widely had forecast a 0.2 percent rise in the department's consumer price index (CPI).

The CPI core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2 percent last month.

Over the past 12 months ending in March, the CPI has climbed 2.8 percent and core prices have risen 2.5 percent.

For the first three months of 1997, the CPI was up 1.8 percent.
