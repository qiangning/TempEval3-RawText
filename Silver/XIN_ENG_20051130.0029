The Asia Media Festival (AMF) trade events opened in Singapore Wednesday with participation of 4, 500 foreign trade delegates and 200 international sellers from 40 countries.

With the AMF events for the public including film screenings on display for two weeks, half a million participants for both consumer and trade events are expected this year.

"The Asia market with its diverse culture and flavor offers tremendous opportunities to the media industry," Singapore Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lee Boon Yang said at the opening ceremony.

He announced that Discovery Networks Asia, the Media Development Authority (MDA) of Singapore and a local production company will jointly adapt Asian-made documentaries for international audiences.

Singapore will be capable of transferring films to high- definition (HD) format by early 2006 while a trial to test HD television services will be carried out by the middle of next year, according to the minister.

Organized by Reed Exhibitions and hosted by the MDA, the Asia Media Festival is an annual fiesta in the media and entertainment industry, and will last until Dec. 2.
