The French right would lose a substantial number of seats in the National Assembly, but retain a comfortable working majority, according to a new poll on snap elections expected to be called Monday.

The ruling rightwing bloc, which currently holds 80 percent of the seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, would lose about 150 -- but still have some 40 seats more than an absolute majority, said the poll in the daily Le Figaro.

The bloc -- comprising the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF) -- would end up with 318 seats, said the survey by the SOFRES polling institute.

Most previous polls have also put the right marginally in front if snap legislative elections are called, as expected by President Jacques Chirac Monday evening. One poll last week suggested an alliance of the opposition Socialist Party (PS), communist and greens could edge ahead of the right.

Chirac is expected to announce the dissolution of parliament in a TV address Monday evening, justifying it by the need to clean the decks ahead of the deadline for a European single currency next year.

Critics say he wants to get the election out of the way before implementing a new round of unpopular austerity measures required to prepare France for economic and monetary union (EMU).

The Le Figaro poll also confirmed that most French people back the idea of snap elections, a year ahead of schedule: 53 percent of those asked supported the dissolution of parliament, against 33 percent against.
