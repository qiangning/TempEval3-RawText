Yi Jianlian's 25 points led China to a 78-67 victory over South Korea in men's basketball at the East Asian Games here on Wednesday.

The 2.12-meter center also had a team high of 15 rebounds and 7 blocks for the team's sixth straight victory and forward Jiao Jian added 15 points and 8 rebounds.

"We played quite a good third quarter," said Yi. "We focused on playing inside and the game became easy for us."

The Chinese used a 8-2 run of its own to start the third quarter and finished it with a 12-4 run, which widen its advantage to 57-48.

Point guard Lee Kwang Jae led the South Korea with 22 points and Yang Hee Jong added 12.

China, who had entered the final stage with 12 points, is to compete with its last rival Hong Kong on Thursday.
