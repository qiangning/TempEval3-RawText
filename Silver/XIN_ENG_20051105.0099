Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Saturday urged Malaysians to continue donating for the victims of the October earthquake in Pakistan.

The fund-raising organizers, including the media, who had stopped their collections, should reopen their funds to the public donations, he told reporters at an "open house" activity in Kepala Batas, a town in the state of Penang.

Badawi made these remarks in response to news reports that Pakistan President Pervez Musharaff was disappointed with the level of international aid to his country, where a strong earthquake claimed lives of over 73,000 people.

Musharaff had said the aid his country received from the international community was far below that contributed to the victims of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina that devastated the gulf coast of the United States.

Badawi said Malaysia had offered significant aid to Pakistan, including medical goods, medical teams, and contributions of materials by Malaysian companies operating in Pakistan. He said that the current international aid to Pakistan was still not enough due to the extent of the earthquake destruction.

He urged the international community to continue giving assistance to Pakistani people to reduce their suffering.
