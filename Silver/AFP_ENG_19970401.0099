Beijing warned the United States Tuesday against interfering in Taiwan after US House of Representative speaker Newt Gingrich said Washington would defend the island against attacks from Beijing.

"The controversy between China and the United States on the Taiwan issue revolves around one point which is US interference," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang.

"The US government and the Congress have expressed their support for the 'one China' policy ... and we hope that the United States will keep its agreements," he added.

Gingrich said Sunday in Shanghai after meeting Wang Daohan, a top Chinese official on relations between China and Taiwan, that the United States would defend Taiwan if China launched a military assault to recover the island.

"We understand that in principle you will not renounce your right to use force. We want you to understand that we will defend Taiwan," Gingrich said.

"This is not waving a saber. It's just a reminder that it is in the scabbard and available," he added.

Shen reiterated China's hopes for a peaceful reunification with Taiwan, but warned: "If the question of independence arises on the island or a foreign force interferes in Taiwan issues, we will be forced to adopt other necessary measures."

He also attacked Washington for its continued arms sales to Taipei.

"These give clear support and encouragement to separtist forces on the island and retards the process of peaceful reunification," he said.

However, Gingrich then toned down his statements Tuesday when speaking to journalists in Tokyo and emphasized that Washington would stick to its 'one China' policy.

Noting Chinese leaders had told him they would not resort to military force easily, Gingrich said: "So, we wouldn't have to defend."

Gingrich is to pay a short visit to Taiwan Wednesday in which he is to meet with President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Lien Chan, a Taiwan presidential spokesman said Tuesday.

They are to discuss US-Taiwan relations, cross-strait ties and other issues of mutual interest, he said.

Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 when the defeated Nationalist government fled there after a bitter civil war.

Last year, Beijing launched a series of intimidatory war games against the island, which ground to a halt when Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers to the region.

While China says its policy towards Taiwan is eventual reunification, Shen refused to comment on reports over the weekend from Tokyo that Jiang would offer the post of vice-president to Taiwan's top official upon reunification.

"I also read these reports, but they were from the meeting between President Jiang and the Japanese foreign minister and I have nothing more to say about that," he said.

"What is more far more urgent is the organisation of high-level political meetings with Taiwan to resolve issues currently on ice. This would have positive effects on peaceful reunification," he added.
