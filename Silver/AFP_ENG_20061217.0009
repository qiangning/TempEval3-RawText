Carmelo Anthony scored 34 points before being ejected with nine other players for throwing a punch as the Denver Nuggets routed the New York Knicks, 123-100 in a game marred by a wild melee.

Marcus Camby had 24 points and nine rebounds for the Nuggets, who angered Knicks coach Isiah Thomas as they kept all their starters on the floor with the game in hand, which may have triggered the brawl.

With the Denver leading, 117-100, with 1:29 remaining, New York rookie Mardy Collins tackled J.R. Smith as he was attempting a transition layup.

Tempers flared and bodies careened into the first row of the stands underneath the Knicks' basket.

Knicks guard Nate Robinson and Smith wrestled, while Knicks guard Jared Jeffries was being restrained by team security.

As the situation was being sorted out, Anthony landed a punch on Collins. All 10 players on the court were ejected.

There is some bad blood between the National Basketball Association teams. Thomas and Nuggets coach George Karl had an argument during a summer league meeting.

Before the fight, Anthony had a remarkable game, demoralizing the Knicks with easy drives to the basket. He shot 15-of-29 from the floor.

Stephon Marbury scored 31 points for New York, which shot 43 percent (41-of-95).
