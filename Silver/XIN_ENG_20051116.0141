Germany will not change its Iraq policy under future Chancellor Angela Merkel, designated Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Wednesday.

"I believe there won't be any fundamental changes," Steinmeier said in an interview with German public television broadcaster ARD.

The grand coalition government of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) had agreed there would be no major changes on the Iraq policy, the future foreign minister said.

Outgoing Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has refused to send any troops to join the US force to Iraq before and after the Iraq war broke out in early 2003.

Merkel, who is to be elected chancellor by parliament on Nov. 22, has indicated she would repair special partnership with the United States, which had been impaired in recent years over Iraq and other issues.

Steinmeier told ARD that he would make some efforts to improve relations with the United States.

"To do nothing would surely not be good advice," said Steinmeier.

However, Steinmeier ruled out any major changes in transatlantic ties.

"People are intelligent enough and know enough on the other side of the Atlantic to see that we are pulling our weight in global engagement and responsibilities," he said.

The future foreign minister noted that the transatlantic partnership and European integration are the two pillars of German foreign policy under the new government.

Steinmeier, Schroeder's close partner in the SPD, will be sworn in on Nov. 22.
