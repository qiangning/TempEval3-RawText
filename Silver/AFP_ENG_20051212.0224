Oil prices climbed on Monday as forecasts for further cold weather in the US northeast offset a decision by OPEC to maintain its output quota, analysts said.

Traders were meanwhile keeping an eye on the enormous fire at a fuel depot north of London, which holds some five percent of Britain's fuel stocks.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in January, rose 47 cents to 59.86 dollars per barrel in electronic trading.

In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for January delivery gained 48 cents to 57.79 dollars per barrel.

"Crude futures were higher on forecasts for colder weather in the US northeast, the world's largest heating oil market, this week," analysts at the Sucden brokerage firm said.

"However gains were limited by the OPEC decision to keep oil output unchanged at a 25 year-high."

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Kuwait, maintained its production quota at 28.0 million barrels per day (bpd) and decided not to renew its offer for emergency extra output of 2.0 million bpd.

However the cartel was ready to cut production at a new meeting at the end of January if demand falls too much, Libya's Energy Secretary Fathi Hamed bin Shatwan and his Qatari counterpart said.

"Now the market is focused on the likely outcome of the next meeting early next year where many have already suggested that OPEC will cut production to cope with swelling supplies as the weather warms up again," Sucden analysts said.

World oil prices rose to the highest levels for more than a month last week as cold weather descended on the US northeast, increasing the likelihood of higher fuel demand for the energy-hungry region.

Crude futures on Friday breached 61 dollars per barrel in New York and almost 60 dollars in London, levels not reached since November 4.

With weather conditions continuing cold in the US northeast, crude prices would remain firm over the coming days, analysts said.

"They are expecting cold weather for the rest of the week so prices aren't likely to fall in the short-term," said Mark Pervan, a commodities analyst with Daiwa Securities in Melbourne, Australia.

The price of oil hit an all-time high of 70.85 dollars per barrel in New York on August 30 following Hurricane Katrina, which devastated refining and crude production facilities along the Gulf Coast of the United States.

Mild weather in the northern hemisphere during October and November saw prices fall heavily.
