India's Hindu nationalists said Monday a new coalition forged by its rivals would be "absurd" and was doomed to fall within six months.

Sushma Swaraj, spokesman of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party), said: "This is another experiment and the fate will be the same. The previous arrangement was an absurd one, whose value was zero. Now it will be worse.

"How long will this stave off fresh general elections? For another six months. As the tradition of Congress is to pull down governments, this will last for not for more than six months."

The comment came after H.D. Deve Gowda, who resigned as prime minister at the weekend after losing a confidence vote, said he was willing to quit as head of the United Front alliance to avoid new elections.

His departure has been demanded by the Congress (I) party as the price of their renewed support in parliament.

The Congress brought down the United Front minority coalition Friday, ending 10 months of support by voting with the BJP.

Swaraj said Deve Gowda's decision was "a victory for the Congress" and said it had won "a war of nerves" with the Front.

Both were intent on keeping the nationalists out of power, she added, but the BJP would win out in the end.

"After the new government fails, people will have a clear alternative. We will win any elections," she said. "It is a win-win position. Whatever the new arrangement, we will gain."

India's 545-seat lower house is almost evenly split between the BJP, the single largest party with 162 seats, the Congress and the United Front, an alliance of 13 leftist, centrist and regional parties.

Both the Congress and the Front refuse to work with the BJP, accusing it of mixing religion with politics.

The BJP still harbours faint hopes of forming a coalition of its own despite Monday's announcement.

While expected to make the major gains in new elections, the BJP said it could still try to form a government if regional parties from the United Front as well as small independent groups offered their backing.

Swaraj said this option was still open. "Any new ally is welcome to join the BJP in a new front, " she said, but conceded no one had yet responded to the offer.
