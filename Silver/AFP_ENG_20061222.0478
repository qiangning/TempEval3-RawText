National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman is looking at realigning the league's divisions and altering its schedule makeup, The Sports Network of Canada reported on its website Friday.

Citing unnamed sources, TSN said the overhaul being considered would see the six current divisions reduced to four with each division having seven or eight teams rather than five.

Six club executives, one from each current division, met with Bettman in New York earlier this week to discuss the matter and take information to other clubs in their division for feedback.

Twenty of 30 teams would have to back such a move in order to make it happen next season. That could happen at a board meeting during the NHL All-Star Game in Dallas next month.

New scheduling plans would see teams play division foes six times, rivals from the same conference three or four times and non-conference clubs once.

The Eastern and Western conferences would each stay with 15 teams, with the top two teams in each division taking the four top playoff seeds and the teams with the next four highest point totals also qualifying in each conference.

The Columbus Blue Jackets and Atlanta Thrashers would switch conferences, with Columbus moving to the East and joining a division with Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Boston, Buffalo and Pittsburgh, which might be relocating after a new arena plan fell apart.

That would leave the New York Rangers and Islanders, New Jersey, Washington, Philadelphia, Carolina, Tampa Bay and Florida in the other Eastern division.

The Western Conference would have an eight-team division with clubs in the Pacific and Mountain time zones, including Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, San Jose, Anaheim, Los Angeles, Colorado and Phoenix.

That would leave seven teams for the remaining division - Dallas, Minnesota, St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta and Nashville.
