Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an iron fist 1973-1990, came to symbolize Latin American military repression and was linked to thousands of tortures, abductions and deaths.

He was in serious condition at the Military Hospital after heart surgery in Santiago Sunday.

Pinochet, 91, has avoided trial on any charge, with his lawyers arguing that "mild dementia" prevents him from defending himself.

Now frail, Pinochet once cut an and awe-inspiring figure in dark glasses and an imposing Prussian-style military tunic and cape.

"Not a leaf moves without my knowledge," Pinochet said, as thousands of Chileans were tortured, executed and forced into exile following the 1973 coup against elected Socialist president Salvador Allende.

The Pinochet era deeply divides Chile even today.

Some Chileans hail him for replacing socialism with free-market policies, despite his international renown for military abuses.

Others say the pain of the dictatorship will continue until Pinochet is convicted or exonerated in court.

During his rule, some 3,000 people were executed or disappeared from custody and presumed killed, according to an official count.

He faces more than 250 charges for alleged rights abuses, including masterminding the infamous "Caravan of Death" that killed 75 regime opponents after he seized power.

Born in the port city of Valparaiso on November 25, 1915, Pinochet never finished his school studies. He was expelled at 15 for misconduct but joined the Military School in 1933, rising slowly through the ranks.

In 1947, Pinochet, then a captain, ran a camp for detainees from the banned communist party.

In one of the ironies of history, Allende himself appointed Pinochet to head the military just one month before the coup.

Four generals took charge and Pinochet grabbed the first turn as leader of what was to be a rotating junta, saying: "I am a man without ambitions." A year later he decreed one-man rule.

Pinochet throttled labor unions and dissolved Congress. Soon outcry over repeated human rights violations turned him into an international pariah.

Nobel Prize winner from Chicago University, the late Milton Friedman, visited Pinochet in Santiago and persuaded him to impose a free-market recipe offered by a group of Chilean economists trained at Chicago.

Immediately, draconian policies to slash inflation and privatize state companies left millions of Chileans jobless.

After a brief boom, the free-market economy crashed 1981-1982. Pinochet was for the first time vulnerable, as students, businessmen and union leaders were emboldened to protest.

On September 7, 1986 Pinochet escaped a guerrilla ambush that killed five bodyguards. The failed assassination led to a new crackdown.

Many died when troops fired on street protesters and police made random mass arrests in Santiago's slums.

In 1988 Pinochet lost a plebiscite on another eight years in office. In 1990, he handed power to Patricio Aylwin, the first democratically elected president since Allende.

Pinochet's 1980 constitution made him head of the armed forces until 1998 and senator for life.

On his 91st birthday a week ago, Pinochet said he held "no grudge against anyone," despite all the "persecutions and injustices" against him.
