Chechen Prime Minister Sergei Abramov, who underwent a kidney surgery after a car accident two days ago, is in normal condition and "feels well", the Interfax news agency quoted his aide as reporting on Saturday.

"No one has any doubt any more that the operation was successful. Abramov feels well. However, the doctors have decided to ban access to his room to any outsiders" except his wife and aide, Abramov's aide Tamerlan Mingayev said.

According to the aide, for the past 24 hours dozens of people, including the prime minister's friends, colleagues and representatives of the Chechen government, the Federation Council, the State Duma and other bodies, have come to the hospital, wishing to see Abramov and to ask about his health.

"Abramov is already trying to sit up in bed," Mingayev said. Abramov didn't hit his head during the accident and didn't suffer any cranial or brain injury. He can cope with everything else, the aide was quoted as saying.

In an earlier interview with Interfax, Chechen Health Minister Shakhid Akhmadov, who had arrived at the Central Clinic Hospital, also said the surgery had been successful and that Abramov was out of danger.

The Chechen prime minister was seriously injured in a traffic accident in Moscow on Thursday evening. The accident occured when the car, in which Abramov was riding on his way to the airport for a flight to Chechnya, collided with a truck.

A spokesman for the Chechen administration in Moscow, Ziyad Sabsabi, ruled out the possibility of an assassination attempt on Abramov, the Interfax news agency reported.

The Chechen republic is expected to hold a parliamentary elections on November 27. Abramov was appointed prime minister of the Russian republic in March 2004.
