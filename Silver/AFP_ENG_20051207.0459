One militant was killed and nine other Palestinians wounded Wednesday in an Israeli air strike on a vehicle in the Rafah region of the southern Gaza Strip, military sources and witnesses said.

Military sources said that the target of the attack, Mahmud al-Arqan, had been working with members of the radical Islamic Jihad movement which was behind a suicide bombing on a shopping mall on Monday.

The strike comes after Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz gave the green light to the resumption of targeted killing operations in the wake of the bombing at the mall in Netanya which killed five Israelis and following a series of rocket attacks on Israeli soil fired from Gaza.

Palestinian sources confirmed the dead man's identity, saying Arqan was a member of the Popular Resistance Committees, an umbrella organisation which has previously carried out rocket attacks against Israel.

The Israeli military sources said that Arqan had been responsible for a range of attacks, including sniper attacks and the firing of anti-tank missiles.

Two of the injured were travelling in the vehicle with Arqan while the other seven were passers-by.

A spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, Abu Abir, said that the movement would avenge Arqan's death.

After the raid, dozens of the group's followers gathered outside Rafah hospital where the victims were being treated, firing their rifles into the air and chanting for his death to be avenged.

Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat "strongly condemned" the attack, describing it to AFP as a "crime which is part of a framework of an Israeli escalation."

The latest death brought the overall toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000 to 4,899. More than three-quarters of the victims have been Palestinian.

Before the air strike, both the Israeli military and Palestinian security forces had carried out a series of arrests in the West Bank of Islamic Jihad activists in the wake of the Netanya blast.

Palestinian security sources said they had arrested three Jihad members in the Tulkarem area of the northern West Bank while Israel said its forces had arrested another Jihad activist in the Balata refugee camp near Nablus.

The father and three brothers of the 21-year-old bomber were detained on Tuesday by the Israeli army at the family home in a village in the northern West Bank which is seen as a stronghold of Jihad.

In a statement issued late Tuesday, Jihad criticised Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas for describing the attack as an act of terrorism and called on him to stop arresting its members and sympathisers.
