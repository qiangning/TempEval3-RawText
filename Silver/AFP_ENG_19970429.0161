India will send paramilitary troops to Bihar state because of fears of a backlash to the possible prosecution of its chief minister, The Statesman newspaper said Tuesday.

The daily quoting home ministry sources said the troops would be deployed in the eastern state because of worries that political turmoil could lead to violence in Bihar.

An Indian government spokesman, however, denied that federal forces were being sent to Bihar.

The state government has been pressing the Indian government for police assistance "to deal with leftwing extremists operating in certain parts of Bihar," the spokesman said.

The official said New Delhi had sent police reinforcements more than a week ago to Bihar. "It has got nothing to do with the current situation," he claimed.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Sunday said it would prosecute state Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav in a multi-million- dollar financial scandal.

Yadav, who is also the president of the largest party in India's ruling coalition, has refused to quit his post and has warned his supporters would "take the issue to the streets."

India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party) and other rivals of Yadav have called a general shutdown on May 3 in Bihar to demand his ouster.
