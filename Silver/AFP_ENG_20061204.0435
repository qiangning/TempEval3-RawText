European Union justice ministers agreed Monday that courts in EU countries should take into account a person's previous convictions anywhere in the bloc when they are being tried.

Under the agreement, a criminal court in a member state will have to take into account previous rulings when someone is held in detention, convicted or punished in another of the 25 EU countries.

The ministers decided the reform was necessary because some states only take into account convictions made within their own jurisdictions, which has allowed some criminals to slip through the legal cracks in other countries.

The aim is to avoid a repeat of incidents such as that involving French serial killer Michel Fourniret, who was able to work in a Belgian school kitchen without Belgian authorities being aware of his previous convictions in France for raping minors.

EU members linked up their criminal records networks last year making the practical implementation of the decision much easier.
