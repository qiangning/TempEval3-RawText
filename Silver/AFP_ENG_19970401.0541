US House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich met Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui Wednesday for talks on bilateral ties at the start of a whirlwind visit to the nationalist island.

Gingrich is the first speaker to visit Taiwan since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.

"We are glad to have this good friend come for a visit," Foreign Minister John Chan said after Gingrich's arrival at 10:30 a.m. (0230 GMT), adding that Taiwan had built a strong friendship with the US Congress.

Gingrich and a 23-member delegation were greeted at the Sungshan Military Airport by Chang and Darryl Johnson, director of Washington's quasi-embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).

They were then escorted to limousines and whisked away to the presidential office, where the US speaker met Lee accompanied by 11 delegation members.

Gingrich is due to have lunch with Premier Lien Chan, who is also vice president, as well as other high-ranking Taipei officials before leaving for home at 1:00 p.m. (0500 GMT).

Chang stressed that Taipei would continue to show the world that cross-strait ties were not soley an internal Chinese issue.

"Our existence must be recognized by the international community," he said.

Gingrich told President Jian Zemin during a visit to China last week that the United States would be prepared to intervene if China invaded Taiwan, which Beijing has regarded as a renegade province since the natinalists fled here in 1949.

Jiang responded with a warning, saying: "We hope the US administration and the Congress will handle the Taiwan issue with caution."

On Tuesday, Beijing again told Washington to stay clear.

"The controversy beween China and the United States on the Taiwan issue revolves around one point which is US interference," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang.

"The US government and the Congress have expressed their support for the 'one China' policy ... and we hope that the United States will keep its agreements," he added.

Gingrich toned down his remarks Tuesday in Tokyo, saying Washington would stick to its "one-China policy."

"Taiwan is a question of great concern ... We favor a one-China policy... with voluntary dicussions between China and Taiwan," he said.
