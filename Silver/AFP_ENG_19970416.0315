British opposition leader Tony Blair Wednesday set out "seven pillars of a decent society" to promote prosperity and security as he attacked the ruling Conservatives for displaying "all the leadership qualities of lemmings."

On the day nominations closed for the May 1 general election, which Blair's Labour is widely predicted to win, the party leader spelt out his alternative vision of a more equal society.

In one of four keynote speeches of the campaign, Blair warned the divided society he said the Tories had created, directing all prosperity to a "charmed circle", was morally wrong and could not prosper economically.

Campaigning in the port of Southampton on Britain's south coast, he said it was time to give back "a heritage of hope" to Britain's children.

Blair's seven pillars of a decent society are: a world-class education system; a comprehensive national health service; security and dignity in retirement; security and freedom from the fear of crime; quality housing; a welfare state without dependence; and strong social institutions, from the family upwards, promoting mutual responsibility and a spirit of public and voluntary service.

Blair claimed the Conservatives saw inequality as a sign of success and accused them of denigrating the health service, the basic pension and public education. If they were re-elected, an American-style "underclass" would develop in Britain, he warned.

"Britain is more divided today than at any time since the war," he said. "We have had for 18 years a politics of self instead of a politics of society."

Blair also used the opportunity to seize on fresh Tory divisions over Europe after two government Euro-sceptic ministers defied Major's policy of waiting to see how European Monetary Union (EMU) developed before deciding whether to join.

"We are witnessing the collapse of the Conservative party under the weight of its own divisions," said Blair.

"We are seeing the culmination of six years of weak leadership, a prime minister reduced to a laughing stock by his MPs, his party now a rabble.

Blair concluded that it was a "defining moment" of the campaign.

"Britain deserves better leadership and I believe the choice is now clear: strong and united leadership with Labour or a Tory Party that displays all the leadership qualities of lemmings."
