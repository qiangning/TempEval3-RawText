A costly and controversial project to link Hamburg and Berlin with a magnetically-suspended high-speed train has been put back on the rails under revised plans presented Friday.

Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann said a revamped consortium would be in charge of realising the "Transrapid" link by 2005 and that the plans had received the blessing of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel. Parliament approved the original project last year.

Adtranz, a specialist subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz and the Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), will join with Germany's Thyssen and Siemens, and a fourth member who entered following the pullout of construction firms Philipp Holzmann, Hochtief and Bilfinger + Berger.

Siemens boss Heinrich von Pierer said initial talks were taking place with the Anglo-French group GEC Alsthom. In Paris, the constructors of the French TGV (High Speed Train) said they were ready to consider any interesting proposal.

The German rail corporation Deutsche Bahn will play a central role in running the link, on which work is planned to start next year.

The train is supposed to 'float' at up to 450 kilometres (280 miles) an hour on a T-shaped mono-rail, cutting travelling time between the two north German cities to about an hour for a journey of 292 kilometres (180 miles).

The cost of the project is 10 percent up on original plans.

Total investment is now put at 9.8 billion (5.7 billion dollars), comprising 6.1 billion marks for the track and 3.7 billion marks for the operating system. In 1993 the cost was put at 8.9 billion marks -- with 5.6 billion marks of this coming from the federal state.

Meanwhile, the expected returns have been revised downward. According to German railways boss Heinz Duerr, the new estimates indicated a "modest but reasonable" economic viability. Opposition to the project is based both on the high cost to the public purse and environmental considerations.
