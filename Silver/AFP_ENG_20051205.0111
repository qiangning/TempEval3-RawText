A South Korean broadcaster has admitted using coercion to obtain information critical of cloning pioneer Hwang Woo-Suk and suspended airing a report alleging his breakthrough stem cell research was fabricated.

Seoul-based MBC issued a statement late Sunday admitting its investigative reporting team had violated journalistic ethics in reporting on Hwang for the weekly program PD Network.

The world-renowned researcher was forced to step down from his official posts and offer an apology on November 24, two days after the network broadcast allegations of ethical lapses in his research.

A second installment of the program, making more explosive claims concerning the validity of Hwang's research, was scheduled to air Tuesday.

"We have decided to suspend a plan to air a follow-up program about Hwang's research," a spokesman for MBC, South Korea's second largest TV network told AFP Monday. He said top executives were discussing when to air the program or whether to scrap it.

President Roh Moo-Hyun, who has closely followed the unfolding controversy, said the matter should now be laid to rest as he pledged continued government support for Hwang's research.

"I hope the issue of verifying the authenticity of professor Hwang's research results should be settled here," Roh told a meeting with senior advisors. "I expect it to be verified naturally by Hwang's follow-up research.

"The government will continue without fail to give support for Hwang's team to conduct its stem cell research," Roh added.

MBC became a target of national anger when it broadcast an initial report attacking Hwang, a national hero, two weeks ago.

The criticism of MBC continued after Hwang admitted the charges were true -- that some of the eggs used in his experiments had been paid for and that others had been obtained from members of his own research team.

International ethical standards frown on egg donations by researchers, especially junior staff who may be vulnerable to pressure.

MBC says it obtained information concerning the origin of the eggs from some of Hwang's own researchers.

It said that, based on interviews with them, it was going to broadcast a second report that would be far more damaging to Hwang's reputation, as it would claim he had faked landmark research findings earlier this year.

However on Sunday MBC was forced into an apology after two of Hwang's researchers told Seoul-based cable news television YTN the MBC team had misled them and used coercion to force them to give information unfavorable to Hwang.

"MBC sincerely apologize to the people," MBC said in the statement. "MBC will insist that those involved in the violations of the journalistic code of ethics take responsibility."

The two researchers deny MBC's contention that they said Hwang's research had been faked.

"I never made such a statement," one of the researchers, Kim Seon-Jeong, the source for the MBC report, said in the YTN interview.

He said he clearly told MBC that the allegations against Hwang concerning falsified research results were "not true."

Hwang's team said in its study published in May in the periodical Science that it had produced patient-specific stem cells from cloned human embryos.

To do this, a patient's somatic cell is planted into a human egg, the nucleus of which has been removed. The DNA of the stem cells produced by the experiment would genetically match the patient's cells.

However, MBC staff said they obtained samples of stem cells from Hwang's team and had them tested independently. Later MBC said the tests were not conclusive but showed there may be problems with Hwang's findings.

According to media reports, of 45 samples tested, only one was found to be readable, and it did not match the original donor cell.

MBC asked Hwang's team to conduct a new test to verify the results but the researchers dismissed MBC's findings and refused, according to media reports.
