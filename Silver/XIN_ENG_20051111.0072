The US dollar dipped against the yen Friday in Tokyo, but its losses were slight considering a Japanese government report saying the country's economy grew more than expected in the July-September period.

At 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), the dollar traded at 117.81-83 yen, compared with Thursday's 5 p.m. quotes of 118.15-25 yen in New York and 117.64-66 yen in Tokyo.

The dollar moved between 117.65 yen and 118.19 yen during the day, most frequently trading at 117.75 yen.

The euro was quoted at 1.1700-1702 dollar and 137.84-88 yen, against Thursday's 5 p.m. quotes of 1.1682-1692 dollar and 138.08- 18 yen in New York and 1.1767-1769 dollar and 138.43-47 yen in Tokyo.

The dollar weakened slightly against the yen after the report showed early in the morning that Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.7 percent in the third quarter, beating a consensus market forecast of 1.1 percent.

But dealers said yen buying seen in response to the GDP data was not more than position-squaring following overnight solid gains for the dollar.

Dealers believe demand for the dollar is highly likely to persist as the currency has attracted bargain hunters even with few fresh buying incentives.
