Police clashed with youths in this northwestern French city on Saturday after authorities banned a rave party due to be held on the sidelines of a rock music festival.

Youths set fire to rubbish bins, smashed car windows and hurled bottles at police after authorities banned the party due to a lack of security, witnesses said.

No one was injured in the mid-afternoon melee which police said involved some 500 youths and 200 officers. Ten people were held for questioning.
