The US Congress early Saturday gave its final approval to a bill to restore normal trade ties with Vietnam.

The bill granting "permanent normal trade relations" (PNTR) status to Vietnam was part of a large omnibus measure approved by the Senate 79-9 during an all-night session.

The US House of Representatives voted for it 212-184 late Friday.
