Entire capital city Dhaka and its surrounding areas have been brought under "terror alert" following an intelligence report about possible militant bomb attacks ahead of opposition's planned grand rally in the city on Tuesday.

According to the intelligence report, the banned Islamist outfit the Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) blamed for country- wide bomb blasts on Aug. 17 which left three people killed and over 150 others injured, has again planned for a series of bomb attacks in the capital city.

Different groups of the said militant outfit are trying to dispatch a huge quantity of high explosive to Dhaka through land or riverine routes.

The JMB is also trying to gather its some highly trained cadres along with the members of "suicide squad" to accomplish their mission.

The JMB might go for blasting high-powered explosives in Dhaka to eliminate opposition and ruling party leaders, high officials including judges and also general people.

In this regard, being directed by the high-ups of the government, a security blanket has been rolled down the capital city since Saturday evening where surveillance was also increased at all the entrance and exit points by setting up additional check posts.

At the same time, the security forces including the para- military the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and Rapid Action Battalion ( RAB) have been put on high alert across the country to prevent any possible terrorist activity by the suicide bombers of JMB.

Meanwhile, 14 opposition political parties headed by Awami League has planned a huge anti-government showdown at a grand rally on Nov. 22 in the capital where opposition leader Sheikh Hasina will announce a comprehensive road map to realize their demands for bringing reforms to caretaker administration and the Election Commission to hold influence-free and neutral polls under a non-partism caretaker government.

Political sources said the Awami League-led 14 parties are likely to issue a one-month ultimatum for the government from the grand rally to concede to their demands.

The opposition planed to gather 2.5 million people on the day in the capital. Leaders of the opposition threatened that agitation would spread out across the country from Nov. 22 if the government obstructed people from joining the grand gathering.

The government has decided to take all the necessary security arrangements with the deployment of 15,000 security personnel including RAB, BDR, police and armed police to ensure smooth holding of the planned grand rally of the opposition.

Against the backdrop of last year's August-21 grenade attack on Awami League's rally in the capital in which 22 leaders and activists of the party were killed and hundreds others injured, the law enforcers will make a fool-proof security over the city to avoid any untoward incident.

In face of the escalating of terrorist bomb attacks, the government is going to start a joint operation to be called "Clean Militant Operation" across the country with the members of the army, BDR, RAB, police and Ansar (militia) to wage a campaign against the members of different banned Islamist militant organizations, especially JMB, with a view to wiping them out, according to The Independent Sunday.

The Special Branch of police and Criminal Investigation Department of police will take special measures to ensure security for VIPs like the ministers, state ministers, deputy ministers and secretaries of different ministries and departments.

The operation will start from this week as part of a short-term plan of the government and will continue for one month.

The government will decide on how to implement the mid-term and long-term plans to net the members of the militant groups, who are scattered across the country.

Around 400 JMB cadres have been arrested from different parts of the country since August-17 country-wide bomb blasts. The law enforcers, however, have failed to arrest the masterminds of the bombing.

Praful C Patel, vice president of World Bank, the main development partner of Bangladesh, recently advised the government of Bangladesh to nab the bomb attackers at any cost. If the government fails to arrest them, the WB reportedly will not come up with necessary assistance for the development projects.
