China aims to keep the registered urban unemployment rate below 5 percent in the coming five years, with additional 45 million people being employed.

China's Minister of Labor and Social Security Tian Chengping said recently that to achieve the goal, adjustments will be made to enlarge the scope of employment.

China will provide preferential policies in loans to encourage people starting their own businesses. Comparing with current policies, the new loan policies will permit guaranteed micro-credits to laid-off workers, unemployed people in urban areas and military officers transferred to civilian work.

"In the following five years, we'll take measures to enlarge the coverage of basic old-age pension. More efforts will be spent to draw more people into the system, such as people working in private enterprises and the self-employed," said Tian.

The total number of skilled workers is expected to exceed 100 million by 2010, with the number of technicians and senior technicians reaching 5.5 million. Various vocational trainings will be provided to help urban and rural labors take a job or start their own businesses, Tian added.

China reported a 4.2 percent registered urban unemployment rate by the end of September. The rate has been kept below 5 percent in recent years, which was 3.6 percent in 2001, 4 percent in 2002, 4.3 percent in 2003 and 4.2 percent in 2004, according to statistics of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
