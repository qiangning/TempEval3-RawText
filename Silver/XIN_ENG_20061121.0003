A Pakistani government minister rejected the charge the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) (formerly known as guerilla) chairman Prachanda claimed that Pakistani intelligence once offered CPN assistance, local nepalnews.com reported Tuesday.

Pakistan's Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azim told BBC Nepali Service on Monday that Prachanda's remarks were "baseless."

Azim said that Prachanda might have said so "perhaps in an attempt to make some people happy."

On Nov. 18, in an interview he gave to The Hindustan Times, Prachanda who had visited New Delhi to attend the Leadership Summit organized by the daily, disclosed that when he decided "to take the movement to the streets", back in 1996, he was offered " assistance" in the form of arms and money from representatives claiming to be from the ISI.

The ISI (Inter Service Intelligence) is an intelligence agency of Pakistan. Indian government routinely accuses ISI of indulging in anti-India activities by using the soil of Nepal as well as Bangladesh. It has also frequently accused ISI of masterminding terrorist attacks within Indian territory.

Prachanda had also claimed that with the growth in his party's movement, the activities of ISI in Nepal have declined. "With our movement gaining people's consensus, the anti-India ISI activity" is almost non-existent.

Prachanda had said, "ISI-type people offered us money and arms assistance. I resisted and our council agreed to refuse the assistance because we felt our movement would lose its Nepali- people-centric approach."
