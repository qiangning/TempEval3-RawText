Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appeared determined Wednesday to crush the first labor dispute against his self-rule government, using arrests and threats of dismissal to force thousands of striking West Bank teachers back to work.

After ordering the roundup of 23 strike leaders Monday, Arafat's Palestinian Authority reportedly arrested several more teachers overnight and deployed police around schools Wednesday to ensure they remained open.

Teachers in Nablus, where the strike for higher pay and better working conditions had closed virtually all public schools since April 5, told AFP that they had returned to work Wednesday under threat of dismissal.

"We were threatened by education ministry officials and security officers that if we didn't hold classs today we would be fired," said one returning teacher on condition he not be identified.

But in Ramallah, teachers refused to go back to work and despite the presence of large numbers of police and preventive security agents at school exits, pupils refused to remain in their classrooms, witnesses said.

Palestinian sources said around 10 more teachers were detained in Ramallah overnight, although this could not be immediately confirmed. Police also confiscated the film of a cameraman trying to video one schoolyard.

Schools also remained closed in Bethlehem, officials said, but teachers returned to work at some schools in Hebron and Jericho, and classes were reported nearly normal in the other self-rule towns of Tulkarem and Qalqilya.

More than 10,000 teachers launched their strike at the start of the month to press demands for a 200 percent pay hike and for the reinstatement of 19 teachers dismissed over a warning strike held the previous month.

Arafat met with strike leaders on Saturday and rejected their pay demands, saying that repeated Israeli security closures of the Palestinian territories over the past year had caused great economic hardship and made such salary increases impossible.

When the teachers voted to continue the strike despite Arafat's appeal, police stepped in and arrested key leaders of the walk-out, which had closed 80 percent of West Bank schools and kept more than 200,000 pupils out of class.

The official teachers' union, affiliated with Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, has condemned the strike and said the coordinating committee leading the action was an illegal offshoot.

The strike has also drawn criticism from a broad range of Palestinian officials, including some independent members of the legislative council who say economic problems and the current stalemate in the peace process with Israel make this the wrong time for divisive protest actions.

"The difficult situation for our people now cannot tolerate that the education of hundreds of thousands of students be disrupted," said Salah Tamari, a legislative council member, on Voice of Palestine radio.

But civil rights groups expressed alarm at the latest illustration of Arafat's heavy-handed response to dissent against his three-year-old self-rule administration.

"The teachers' arrests make us more worried about the status of democracy and freedom of expression in Palestinian society," said Riziq Shuqair of the Ramallah-based human rights movement Al-Haq.

The group sent Arafat a letter Wednesday calling for the release of the jailed strikers.

"This is not only a message for teachers but is a message from the Palestinian Authority to everyone: 'If you protest, we will crush you,'" said one Nablus worker who asked not to be identified.

Teachers earn an average of 300 dollars a month, while the monthly cost of living for a Palestinian family is estimated at 750 dollars.

They complain that teachers' wages are lower than those in other government ministries, which they say Arafat has bloated with high- paid cronies.

The PA faces a budget deficit totalling more than 100 million dollars, largely due to the impact of the security closures imposed following anti-Israeli attacks.

The closures prevent tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers from reaching their jobs in Israel, costing the occupied territories several million dollars a day in lost revenues.
