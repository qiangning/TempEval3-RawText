The fiscal deficit in the first 10 months this year of the Philippine government reached 56.3 billion pesos (1.12 billion U.S. dollars), lower than 115.5 billion pesos (2.23 billion U.S. dollars) incurred during the same period last year, the Philippine Central Bank said on Thursday.

The lower deficit was a result of better revenue performance and lower-than-expected spending due to the non-approval of the 2006 proposed budget bill, said the central bank.

Moreover, the first ten months' deficit is just 45 percent of the full year target of 125 billion pesos (2.5 billion U.S. dollars).

From January to October, government revenues were up by 19 percent compared to the same period last year, with collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs reaching 522.8 billion pesos 10.5 billion U.S. dollars) and 159.8 billion pesos (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) respectively.

The Philippine government is cutting its fiscal deficit as part of its fiscal reform package which is aimed at reaching zero deficit by 2010, the year President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's presidential term expires.
