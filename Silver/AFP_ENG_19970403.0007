China's capital city has introduced a "card" system to protect foreign investors from officials' arbitrary illegal fees, mayor Lu Yucheng was quoted as saying Thursday.

The cards, issued to foreign-funded enterprises, identify a limited list of officially-sacntioned fees and give firms the right to refuse to pay any charge not cited, he said.

Only three bodies in the city -- the municipal government, the municipal bureau of finance and the municipal bureau of price -- are authorised to establish new fees, the report said.

Investors in China have long complained of cost overruns caused by local officials' legion unpredictable fees.

Though government policy has sought to attract investment, the practices of corrupt individual administrators and departments often undermine the effort.

Three centres have been set up in the city to receive foreign investors' complaints, Lu said.
