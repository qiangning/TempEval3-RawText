The 55 member states of the OSCE have agreed to reform the organisation without changing the role of its election monitoring teams, but a joint declaration at the close of the summit is unlikely, US and European Union officials said Tuesday.

US Under-Secretary of State Nicholas Burns said, hours before the end of the ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Ljubljana, that all 55 members of the pan-European organisation had agreed on a roadmap for reform as requested by Russia.

He added most of the participants had agreed the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the OSCE's election monitoring body, "should be strengthened instead of weakened."

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attacked the ODIHR Monday, saying it had an "unacceptable autonomy" in monitoring elections, mainly in the former Soviet states, and urged the organisation to set clear guidelines for its methodology, composition and work.

While a compromise was reached over OSCE reforms due to start next year, Russia could not agree with the US and the European Union on a joint final declaration, which must be unanimously approved by participants before the end of the conference.

"We are not ready to trade principles for a document," Burns said, adding negotiations had failed because of Russia's refusal to acknowledge the so-called Istanbul commitments to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova, which Moscow agreed to in 1999.

"The great majority of countries believe we should reaffirm the commitments of Istanbul," Burns said, adding all member states were ready to praise Moscow's progress in pulling out of bases in Georgia, following an agreement signed last May.

"But there has been no progress in Moldova since 2003 in terms of reduction of the Russian forces," Burns said.

The head of the British delegation, John Sawers, said the European Union proposed a compromise over the final declaration that was initially accepted by Washington while the Russians were still considering it.

"The Russians may object to it, in which case the language (declaration) may well be used by the chairman in office," Sawers said, meaning the conference chairman, Slovenia's Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, would issue a final statement if a consensus cannot be reached over the document.
