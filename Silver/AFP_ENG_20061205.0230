Turkey on Tuesday urged EU leaders to avoid "a historic mistake" when they discuss the country's membership bid next week and warned that a German proposal to set a deadline for Ankara to grant trade priviliges to Cyprus would have a "very negative impact."

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he telephoned German Chancellor Angela Merkel hours before she was to meet French President Jacques Chirac in Mettlach, Germany, to seek backing for Berlin's proposal.

"I reminded her what the costs of a wrong step could be," Erdogan told the parliamentary group of his Justice and Development Party.

"I told her that we hope such a historic mistake will not occur at the summit of EU leaders on December 14-15," he said.

EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on December 11 to discuss a European Commission recommendation to partially freeze membership talks with Turkey because of its refusal to open its sea and air ports to Cypriot vessels under a customs union pact with the bloc.

If they fail to reach a unanimous decision, the issue is expected to go on the agenda of an EU summit three days later.

Merkel wants the EU to give Turkey an 18-month deadline to open its ports to Cyprus as a condition for resuming full membership talks.

Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said the German proposal would make things worse.

"With the Commission's recommendations unacceptable as they are, such a proposal will make things even worse," Gul said after talks here with his Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt.

"It would have a very negative impact on the negotiation process... (but) I do not believe that this will happen," he said.

Turkey says its ports will remain closed to Cyprus unless the 25-nation bloc keeps promises mqde in 2004 to ease the economic isolation of the divided island's breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.
