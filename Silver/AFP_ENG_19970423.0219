Governments around the world praised President Alberto Fujimori for ending an 18-week hostage standoff with a spectacular attack that left 17 people dead but freed 71 prominent captives.

Peruvian troops stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence Tuesday in a surprise operation that killed one hostage, two members of the security forces and all 14 hostage-takers.

Fujimori celebrated his spectacular victory over the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels by dining late Tuesday with top officials at a restaurant in the posh neighborhood of San Isidro, the same neighborhood where the hostage crisis evolved.

"Peru will never cave in to blackmail by subversive elements," Fujimori told a crowd in central Lima after the crisis ended.

In Tokyo, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Wednesday during talks with Peru's ambassador to Japan that he hoped to visit Fujimori soon.

"Once things are settled and when President Fujimori has the time, I want to visit Lima and give my thanks to him directly," he was quoted as saying.

Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda was scheduled to leave for Lima late Wednesday, officials said.

South Korean President Kim Young-Sam and Philippine President Fidel Ramos and both congratulated Fujimori on a job well done.

The Peruvian Congress late Tuesday praised the military intervention, calling it a "glorious page" in Peruvian history, and naming Supreme Court justice Carlos Giusti, who died of a heart attack after he was shot during the rescue operation, a "civil hero."

Bolivian Ambassador Jorge Gumucio, one of the freed hostages, said that troops assaulted the building when the captors were playing a football match in the residence reception hall.

"An explosion underneath the reception hall, where a tunnel had been dug, killed most of the terrorists (and) I saw five or six of them collapse," Gumucio said.

Officials said 140 crack troops entered the residence compound through an underground tunnel whose construction was cited by the rebels as the reason for an abrupt suspension of negotiations on March 6.

The sunny afternoon calm in the posh neighborhood was shattered by the sound of automatic gunfire and a series of explosions that left a thick, black pall over the compound.

Roughly 40 minutes after the operation began, jubiliant soldiers appeared on the rooftop of the residence, flashing the 'V' victory sign.

Then Fujimori -- who ordered the operation even though his brother Pedro was among the hostages -- arrived to tour the residence and embraced the freed hostages.

Twenty-four Japanese nationals, including Ambassador Morihisa Aoki, were set free.

Some two dozen people, mostly hostages, were slightly hurt in the operation. Two others were seriously injured but expected to recover.

The hostage crisis began last December 17 when the guerrillas entered the compound during a gala reception attended by numerous dignitaries.

They initially seized some 700 hostages, but soon released all but 72 men.

The rebels demanded the release of some 400 imprisoned comrades.

Fujimori and top government ministers met the negotiators who have been trying to broker an agreement between the government and the rebels late Tuesday to inform them of the reasons behind his approval of the attack.

The mediators -- Ayacucho Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani, Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent, and International Red Cross representative Michel Mining -- withdrew without talking to reporters.

At midnight, while the bodies of the MRTA guerrillas remained in the residence, residents from the working-class Lima neighborhood of San Juan de Miraflores reported seeing a red flag in support of the guerrillas on a nearby hill.

Callers who claimed to speak for the MRTA telephoned several news organizations to warn of retaliation.

Soon after the rescue, Hashimoto thanked Fujimori, but noted: "I regret to say that the Peruvian government did not notify us before they stormed the residence."

In the Philippines, Ramos told reporters he has sent a letter to Fujimori expressing Manila's support for his decision to use force in freeing the hostages.

"The Philippines stands very firm against the scourge of terrorism in all its forms," Ramos said.

Kim sent a congratulatory message to Fujimori for wrapping up the incident "at a minimal cost of human life."

"I pay my deep respect for patience and courage shown in the course of addressing the four-month-long hostage case," Kim said in a written statement.

One South Korean national and one ethnic Korean were among the original group of hostages, and were soon released.

Not all foreigners were happy, however. In Guatemala, some 60 pro-MRTA students threw rocks at the Peruvian embassy and spray-painted anti- Fujimori slogans on nearby walls.
