Nine people were killed and nine others injured in a violent militant attack in Thailand's southern Narathiwat province early Wednesday.

A group of suspected Muslim separatists raided two houses in the province's Rangae district at one O'clock Wednesday morning. They shot into houses with M-70 rifles, killing nine villagers and injuring nine others, local police said.

At least two villagers were believed to be followers of the militants. They lobbied other villagers that it is the Thai authorities who had launched the attack.

A large numbers villagers from the district and nearby areas have congregated on the road, blocking police and the army from entering inside.

Fearing clashes with local people, the security force were still waiting for instructions from the army commander.

More than 1,000 people have died since January last year in near-daily attacks in the strip near the Malaysian border. Authorities and experts blame the attacks on a web of Islamic separatists, local corruption and organized crime.
