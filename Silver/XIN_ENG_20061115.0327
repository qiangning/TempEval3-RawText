The Nigerian government approved measures to promote agricultural production in the country's vast north, a senior official has said.

Nigerian Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Adamu Bello said on Tuesday that the government had approved run-off water harvesting projects for irrigation and cattle rearing in northern states of Sokoto, Jigawa and Yobe.

The projects were funded from the debt relief gains under the Millennium Development Goals, he said, adding that the run-off water harvesting structures would bring about 40 million cubic meters of flood water for irrigation and domestic use.

The minister explained that the projects would encourage the production of meat, milk and cheese as well as increase farmers' income and minimize poverty in the benefiting states.

The federal government was working toward addressing the threats of environmental degradation and other severe stress facing the country's land and water resources, he added.
