Hopes of face-to-face talks between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila rose Sunday after the two adversaries indicated they were prepared to meet.

The rebels' top foreign affairs official said Kabila was to give a fresh impetus to peace talks with Mobutu's regime, probably with a visit to South Africa where negotiations have been taking place on a junior level.

Rebel "foreign minister" Bizima Karaha told a news conference that Kabila will travel "very soon, probably to South Africa, to boost the negotiations" there.

Asked if this meant the leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire would be meeting Mobutu, Karaha said: "If necessary, he will meet him."

He reiterated the rebel demand that Mobutu quit power and that no ceasefire could be considered before negotiations take place.

On Saturday, Mobutu offered for the first time to meet Kabila, although he dismissed as impertinent a rebel ultimatum to quit power by Sunday.

"If he asks politely, I cannot refuse to speak to a Zairean compatriot," the president said of Kabila.

His offer was a major step forward, a diplomat said. "He puts the ball in Kabila's court by opening the door to a meeting. This is significant."

On Friday, in an interview with AFP, Kabila said he wanted a face-to- face meeting with Mobutu as a "short cut" to end the fighting.

But he said "Mobutu is ashamed to meet me. They don't know what they would say to me."

Kabila was talking from a position of strength, unlike the cancer- stricken president who is desperately trying to salvage his corrupt 32-year regime.

The rebels now control nearly half of Zaire, including its second and third cities and the vast majority of its huge mineral resources, as a result of the six-month-old offensive against Kinshasa.

Mobutu also has problems in Kinshasa, where the main political opposition, led by sacked prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi, has called a mass strike for Monday.

Deputy interior minister, Lumuna Ndubu, said soldiers would be deployed on the streets of Kinshasa from early Monday to counter the day of inaction, and he urged people to go about their normal daily business.

"The soldiers will be deployed in the streets to ensure the security of the population," he told state television.

Mobutu declared a state of emergency across Zaire on Tuesday.

Karaha, speaking at the news conference in rebel-held Goma, on the border with Rwanda, said a ceasefire before negotiations "will prolong the agony of our people and allow Mobutu to stay in power even longer. We want him to go. If Mobutu goes, that will be the end of the war."

He rejected the idea of immediate elections, arguing they would not be free and fair.

After a rebel victory, he added, a "transition" government comprising only Alliance leaders would be formed, and it would remain in office for a year to organise general elections.

Asked if the rebels favoured military means to take power above talks, he said: "Negotiations can be used to achieve the objectives of the Alliance."

Karah also denied that the rebels considered France as an enemy because of its long-standing support for the Mobutu regime, although Paris has suggested that the president should resign.

"We are not France's enemies. We never have been and perhaps never will be. We have no enemies apart from the dictatorship in Kinshasa."

Meanwhile some 300 displaced Zaireans were flown Sunday from the rebel-held eastern city of Kisangani to their home region of Goma on board a UN plane, UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Peter Kessler said in Nairobi.

UN agencies have already airlifted several hundred Rwandans from eastern Zaire to Goma and Kigali in the past few weeks.

The 80,000 Rwandans near Kisangani are emaciated and ill after fleeing the rebel advance, usually without access to relief food or medical care.

More than 600 of the refugees died of diseases and malnutrition last week, a UNHCR spokesman said Saturday.
