Karl Hass, who is being tried along with fellow ex-Nazi officer Erich Priebke for the massacre of 335 civilians in 1944, went on to work as a spy for the Italians and the Americans, a lawyer for the victims' families said Tuesday.

Giancarlo Maniga told a court here that Hass, who remained in Italy after the end of the war, "in 1951 ... passed into the service of the Americans and in 1953 of the Italian interior ministry and in 1955 he supplied Italian documents to the Soviets."

Maniga also said that Hass, 84, was involved in a number of bloody attacks carried out by right-wing extremists during the 1970s.

He asked that documents from the trials held over the attacks -- one in Milan in 1969 that left 16 people dead and another in Brescia in 1974 that killed eight people -- be included in the current proceedings.

The trial of Hass and Priebke opened on April 14 before a military tribunal in the top security prison in Rebibbia.

Priebke, who was extradited from Argentina in 1995, has already been tried once before in connection with the killings. He was found guilty of murder last August, but the military tribunal ruled that the crime was covered by Italy's 20-year statute of limitations.

Priebke was freed, but the verdict sparked an outcry and he was immediately rearrested.

Hass, Priebke's former commander, confessed while testifying in the earlier trial to taking part in the massacre. He admitted shooting two of the hostages "to set an example to his men."

The Ardeatine Cave massacre in the southern suburbs of Rome was one of most notorious crimes committed in Italy during World War II.

Following the deaths of 33 Nazi soldiers in an attack by resistance fighters, the SS commander for Rome Herbert Kappler, who was later jailed for his role, ordered that 10 Italian hostages should be killed in retaliation for every German death. He delegated the task to Priebke, his deputy.

Earlier in Tuesday's hearing, a lawyer for the Jewish community in Rome asked that documents from Kappler's trial be included in the current proceedings.

Kappler took responsibility for the killings, thus ensuring that Priebke and Hass would go free.
