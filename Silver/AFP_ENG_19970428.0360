Visiting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin gave a thinly veiled warning to Slovakia on Monday that its drive towards NATO membership could affect its relations with Moscow.

According to the spokesman of Slovakian President Michal Kovac, with whom Chernomyrdin met, the Russian premier said that former Warsaw Pact states seeking NATO membership "risked affecting their relations" with Moscow.

Slovakia, itself a former Warsaw Pact member, is the central European country with which Moscow enjoys the best relations. However, its readiness to seek membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is worrying the Russians who remain strongly opposed to NATO expansion.

Kovac said that Slovakia's desire to join NATO, which is favoured by the government and will be put to voters in a referendum in May, was not "directed against Russia" nor motivated by a "threat" from the east.

The two men met during Chernomrydin's 48-hour visit to Bratislava which will coincide with the signature of a dozen commercial and military accords on Tuesday.

The Russian premier has frequently voiced Moscow's opposition to NATO's eastward expansion, most recently during a visit to the neighbouring Czech Republic last week.

The Czech Republic is expected to be among the first former Warsaw Pact states to be offered membership at a NATO summit in July.

The 12 accords due to be signed Tuesday cover a long-term gas contract for Slovakia, barter arrangements and permission for Bratislava to use Russian military technology.
