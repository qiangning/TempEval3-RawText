"China maintains its stance that both sides should seek a rational solution through friendly consultation," Jiang said at a press briefing.

The two countries appointed special envoys in 2003 to draw up a resolution to the dispute. Since then, frequent diplomatic efforts on the border issue have been carried out, which led to an agreement on the "guiding principles" on how resolve the dispute signed by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2005.
