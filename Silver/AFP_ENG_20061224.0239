Hobbling Everton midfielder Tim Cahill believes he will return from his lengthy, injury-enforced absence a better player.

The Australian international, who is expected to return to the first-team in January, is stepping up his rehabilitation from a knee injury suffered against Aston Villa on November 11, and has kicked a ball again for the first time.

"I've not had one down moment throughout this injury, I've worked hard and looked at the positives," said Cahill.

"I've spent a lot of time with my family and with my boys because (in the past couple of years) I've not had the chance to have a proper holiday.

"There's a lot to my game that I need to think about and I've been working on other areas.

"Obviously it's hard being injured but you have to have high spirits for the lads."

Despite his absence, Cahill remains Everton's top scorer with seven goals and was playing a crucial role for the Merseysiders when he suffered the injury which was caused by a challenge from team-mate Lee Carsley.

"I want to come back fully fit and start where I left off," he told the Liverpool Daily Post.

"I scored a few goals and was playing well but the biggest thing was that I got injured.

"I have to look at the pluses and the plus is that I've had a bit of a rest and when I get back hopefully I'll be revived for the start of the New Year - I hope to be buzzing and scoring more goals."
