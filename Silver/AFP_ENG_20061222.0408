NASA opted not to bring down the space shuttle Discovery on a first Florida landing attempt Friday due to bad weather conditions, the space agency announced.

The US space agency left open the possibility that after another 90 minutes conditions will have changed to allow a descent to Florida's Kennedy Space Center.

If not, the shuttle can still possibly land at one of two other sites Friday: Edwards Air Force Base in California and the White Sands test facility in New Mexico.
