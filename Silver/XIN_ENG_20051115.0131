Experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and China's Ministry of Public Health praised the Hunan Provincial Children's Hospital here Tuesday for its successful cure of a suspicious case of pneumonia.

A nine year old boy and his sister developed symptoms of pneumonia in xianggang county, central-south Hunan province, last month after eating a chicken that had died of bird flu. A 36-year-old male was also diagnosed with pneumonia at around the same time. Only the boy and the man survived.

Both brother and sister were sent to the Hunan Provincial Children's Hospital. The twelve-year-old girl died on her second day in the hospital. Her brother surnamed He, left hospital on November 12.

"We must congratulate the hospital on curing the nine-year-old boy. That is really an exciting piece of news," said Julie Hall, WHO's permanent inspector in Beijing, who led a five-member panel to Hunan.

Hall said the panel together with Chinese experts from the Ministry of Public Health will collect disease samples and data from the other two pneumonia patients.

"We will upload the treatment and some related information into the database of the WHO for further studies," she said.

China's Ministry of Public Health reported on Nov. 6 that the pneumonia among the three had unknown causes, and that H5N1 virus could not be ruled out.
