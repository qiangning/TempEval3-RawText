Japanese core consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in November from a year earlier, the government said Tuesday as deflationary pressure eases in the country.

Consumer prices in November as a whole, including volatile prices of fresh food, rose 0.3 percent year-on-year, preliminary figures from the Ministry of Internal Affairs showed.

The December core consumer price index (CPI) for Tokyo alone -- the leading indicator for national price trends -- rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier.
