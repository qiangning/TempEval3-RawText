The UN refugee agency on Thursday said it was putting off the start of repatriation operations for Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire until Saturday.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees earlier announced that the airlift from Kisangani to Rwanda via Goma was scheduled to begin Friday with 80 refugee children from the Biaro camp, which is free of the cholera epidemic reportedly flaring in the nearby Kasese camp.

UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg told AFP in rebel-held Kisangani that the governor of the Upper Zaire region feared the epidemic could spread outside the camp.

"We had a two-hour meeting with the governor, during which we tried to explain our point of view," Stromberg said.

"By transporting people in good health, there would be no risk of disease spreading," he said. "But by delaying their departure, they would remain in a haven of cholera."

"There will be a meeting on Friday between health experts. They should find a consensus. We are optimistic, and have postponed the operation by a day," Stromberg said.

At Kasese, 303 cases of cholera have been recorded in the last 10 days, and 19 people have died, while 42 have been treated and released from hospital, the UNHCR has reported.

Some 700 children without adult company have been registered among the refugees in the camps, but UNHCR puts their true figure closer to 4,000.

Up to 100,000 refugees are staying at the two camps.

The Zairean rebel alliance, which seized Kisangani a month ago, on Wednesday gave the go-ahead for their repatriation, which could take two to three months.

The UN agency has three Russian Ilyushin transport planes and one Hercules C-130 at its disposal, but must use the smaller, local airstrip because the international runway had been mined by retreating Serb mercenaries fighting on behalf of the Zairean government.

Despite the obstacles, the UNHCR plans to repatriate more than 1,000 refugees a day once the operation gets underway.
