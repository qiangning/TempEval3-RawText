Police in Sarajevo on Saturday foiled an apparent attempt to kill Pope John Paul II, discovering 23 landmines wired to explode under a bridge the pope was set to cross later in the day.

The apparent attempt on the pope's life was found hours before the pope was set to arrive in the Bosnian capital for an historic two-day visit aimed at boosting reconciliation in Bosnia.

On arrival at the bridge on the main road into the city, "Bosnian police and the (UN) International Police Task Force found 23 mines connected to a detonator with additional plastic explosives and a remote control," said UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko.

The mines had apparently been planted there Friday night.

Police said they had arrested a man Saturday claiming he wanted to kill the pope. The pontiff was due to arrive in the city at around 5:30 p.m. (1530 GMT).

It was not clear whether the arrest of the man, whose name was not immediately released, was linked to the discovery of the explosives.
