Australia's Westpac Banking Corp. Thursday announced a billion dollar bid to merge with the regional Bank of Melbourne Ltd (BML).

"This announcement is a significant milestone in our aim of being the best in Australia and New Zealand," Westpac managing director Robert Joss said.

Westpac has valued the Victorian state banking group at 1.435 billion Australian dollars (1.13 billion US) and launched a 9.75 dollars a share bid.

"This merger reinforces our regional approach and takes the bank well down a path where we now have a critical share in each of our major customers," Joss said.

Analysts said the Westpac bid was fully priced and pitched about 2.6 times net tangible assets, reflecting the value of BML to Westpac.

"Bank of Melbourne is a very attractive asset; it's a very, very efficiently run bank with a very strong local franchise." Shaw Stockbroking's Anusha Srinivasan said.

"As far as Westpac is concerned it strengthens them in Victoria where they've been the weakest of the four (major Australian banks)."

Under the merger, BML and the Victorian retail operations of Westpac would be combined. The merged operation would trade in Victoria under the BML name.

The Westpac brand would continue in the large corporate, commercial and institutional markets.

The merger proposal is subject to necessary regulatory consents and BML shareholder approval.

BML chairman Chris Stewart will join the Westpac board while Westpac managing director Robert Joss and another senior Westpac executive will join the BML board.

"The directors of the Bank of Melbourne believe the merger proposal is very attractive and recognises the strong position that the Bank of Melbourne has achieved in the Victorian market," Stewart said.

Until the merger is approved both BML and Westpac will trade as usual.

Stewart admitted there would be bank closures and job loses arising from the merger.

"There are 360 branches between Westpac and Bank of Melbourne in Victoria and we may end up with two hundred and something," he said.

Treasurer Peter Costello, meanwhile, said the government would not approve any bank mergers before the government announced its response to an inquiry into Australia's financial system.

He said he would have to personally approve any bank mergers, and the Westpac/BML deal would not receive any priority.

"No priority will be given to applications which seek to anticipate that announcement," Costello told reporters.

Analysts say the (Wallis) inquiry is expected to recommend ways to enhance competition and improve regulation.

It has examined whether the government should retain its policy which keeps Australia's six largest finanical institutions -- four major banks and two major insurance houses -- separate from each other.

The report was expected to be with Cabinet next week, Costello said.

BML shareholders are expected to vote on the merger proposal in June.

Analysts said shareholders were certain to embrace the offer with the only hurdle being approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

BML shares surged 95 cents, or 9.9 percent, in early trade to an all- time high of 9.75 dollars following news of the bid.

Westpac shares fell 7.3 cents, or 1.0 percent, to 6.80 dollars.
