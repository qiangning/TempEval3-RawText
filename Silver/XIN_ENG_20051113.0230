England's surprise 3-2 victory over Argentina in a pre-World Cup friendly played in Geneva roiled the Argentine press on Sunday.

Argentina was leading 2-1 in the 88th minute, when England international Michael Owen, scored two goals from two headers in the last two minutes of the game.

Buenos Aires sports paper Ole howled in disappointment.

"It was like bedding the woman of your dreams, closing your eyes for a moment and waking up to find you have been talking to your pillow all along," said the paper in an editorial.

England's Swedish manager Sven Goran Eriksson "demonstrated intelligence and maturity by attacking when it had to do so; neither too early nor too late. And that is a quality we have not seen in Argentina in any way," the paper said.

Daily paper La Nacion said that the score was a "harsh punishment" because Riquelme and Ayala had not cleared the ball from Argentina's goalmouth effectively.

Argentina had deserved a win until the final "accident", the paper argued.

"There was a battle of style between the English tradition of long balls...and the closely woven football of Argentina's old school. And ours was clearly superior. Until the last minute accident," said La Nacion, before heaping praise on match-winner Michael Owen.

"Michael Owen, who had gone unnoticed for nearly all the game, suddenly became the man of the night. That is how good goalscorers are: cold, lethal and merciless with careless rivals," the paper said.
