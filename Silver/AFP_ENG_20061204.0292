English Championship strugglers Hull on Monday sacked manager Phil Parkinson.

Hull chairman Adam Pearson decided to dismiss Parkinson, who was only appointed in June, after Saturday's 4-2 home defeat against Southampton left his team in 23rd place in English football's second tier.

Parkinson's side had won just four of 21 league matches this season and fans called for him to quit after Saturday's loss.

Hull coaches Colin Murphy and Phil Brown will take charge of the first team on a temporary basis.
