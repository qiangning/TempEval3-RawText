Australia's AWB on Thursday said a US decision to punish the disgraced wheat exporter for bribing the ousted Iraqi regime by barring it from government contracts and programmes would have no impact.

US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns announced overnight the suspension of AWB and its affiliates, as well as 11 former employees, from US government contracts and participation in programs such as export credits.

However AWB spokesman Peter McBride said the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) move would have little practical effect as the company had not used US subsidies since early 2004.

"As we haven't used the program for over two and a half years and we are currently not using it, we will just continue to have discussions with them (USDA) going forward," he said.

"We have informed them recently that we would voluntarily step down from using the export program. We don't envisage using it in the foreseeable future."

McBride said there seemed to have been some misunderstanding as AWB had yet to receive official notification of suspension from the USDA, despite ongoing discussions on the issue.

Last month, an official inquiry here recommended that 11 former executives of AWB face criminal prosecution over corruption linked to the United Nations oil-for-food program in Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

AWB, formerly the government-owned Australian Wheat Board, was found guilty of paying some 220 million US dollars in bribes to secure wheat contracts from the regime before Saddam was ousted in the US-led invasion of March 2003.

USDA spokeswoman Dana Johnson said the action was taken after the Foreign Agricultural Service scrutinised the Cole report.

The final report of the 10-month Cole inquiry, an investigation by former judge Terence Cole, concluded that AWB knowingly paid bribes to Baghdad to win wheat contracts and then misled the Australian government and the United Nations.

"We have taken this step based on the evidence and on our duty to protect the public interest and to ensure the USDA only does business with responsible individuals," Johnson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Although most of the personnel named in the Cole report were no longer involved with the company, the debarment still applied to AWB, Johnson said.

She said the immediate suspension barred AWB and individuals from contracting with the US government and participating in most US programs.

"AWB USA Limited had in the past in 2002-04 accessed some of the USDA export credit guarantee programs," she said.

AWB now has a month to announce whether it will contest the move, a decision that could spark a drawn-out hearing process.
