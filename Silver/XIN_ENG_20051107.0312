Seventeen people have been arrested in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's largest and second largest cities, as a result of a counter-terrorism operation.

The joint operation involved the Australian Federal Police (AFP) ,Australian Security Intelligence Organization and police from the states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, and the NSW Crime Commission.

"The men have been charged with a range of offenses including sections of Commonwealth legislation that have not been previously used, relating to being a member of a terrorist group, conspiring to commit a terrorist act and directing a terrorist organization," said the AFP in a statement Tuesday.

While executing 22 search warrants across Sydney and Melbourne Tuesday morning, police officers also seized a range of material including unidentified substances, firearms, travel documents, computers and backpacks.

"By working collaboratively Australia's law enforcement and intelligence agencies have managed to disrupt the alleged activities of this group and therefore protect the Australian community from a potential terrorist threat," AFP Deputy Commissioner John Lawler said.

All have been charged under the Criminal Code Act 1995. The charges include Acts in Preparation of a Terrorist Act, being a member of a Terrorist Group, Conspiracy to Commit a Terrorist Act and one man has been charged with Directing a Terrorist Organization.

"Today's arrests follow a lengthy operation where law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been monitoring and investigating the activities of a group allegedly intent on carrying out what we assess as some sort of terrorist act in Australia," said NSW Police Commissioner Ken Moroney.

"It will be alleged in court that following months of discussion individuals had moved to the point of planning some sort of activity including the purchase of potentially dangerous materials," he said.

Those charged are expected to appear in Sydney and Melbourne courts later on Tuesday.
