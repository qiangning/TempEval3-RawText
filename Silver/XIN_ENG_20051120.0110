Ericsson, the world's leading mobile network supplier said Saturday it will invest 1 billion US dollars to expand its fast growing business in China in the coming five years.

Mats Holsson, president of Ericsson (China) Company Ltd. said the money will go to a variety of sectors including the supply, production, research and development departments.

"We will step up with the development of telecommunication service in China, meanwhile promote the 3G projects here to help our customers cope with the challenge." said Holsson.

"Guangdong is one of our key markets in Asia. We have set up here a new R&D company in May this year. It will contribute to the application of the 3G technology." said Svanberg.
