A US soldier was killed and four other people were injured by an improvised explosive device Tuesday in Afghanistan's eastern province of Paktika, the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, US military said.

"The unit was conducting offensive operations to prevent enemy activity in Gayan area when the device detonated. One US service member was killed, and another US service member, two Afghan Security Forces members and an Afghan civilian were injured in the explosion," US military said in a press release.

"They were traveling in an up-armored high-mobility, multi- purpose, wheeled vehicle when this occurred. Those injured were evacuated by air to a nearby forward operating base for treatment. All are currently in stable condition," it added.

The name and unit of the deceased service member is being withheld pending notification of next of kin.

Taliban militants, who have vowed to continue Jihad or the holy war against the Karzai government and foreign troops, have intensified attacks against Afghan and foreign soldiers. More than 1,500 have been killed with the majority of them Taliban militants in the Taliban-linked militancy since the beginning of this year.

About 18,000-strong US-led Coalition forces have been stationed in Afghanistan after the collapse of the Taliban regime in late 2001 with the main task of anti-terrorism. More than 80 US soldiers have died this year in Taliban-linked militancy, which makes this year the bloodiest one since the beginning of the Operation Enduring Freedom.
