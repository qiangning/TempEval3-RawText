The white characters "Xingxing Breeding Farm" can still be seen on the red brick wall, but there is no poultry there.

On Oct. 14, chickens suddenly dropped dead by the dozen in the farm in Tengjiaying Village in Saihan District of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. On Oct. 19, the State Bird Flu Reference Lab confirmed that they died of H5N1 bird flu.

After being sprayed with disinfectant at two checkpoints, 24 reporters, in protective suits and masks, were allowed to enter the village Thursday.

The road to the Xingxing Breeding Farm in the village was covered by lime, a kind of white, chalky disinfectant powder.

Coving nearly one hectare of land, the farm had some 7,000 poultry, including chickens, ducks, geese, peacocks and pigeons.

Before the outbreak of the bird flu, owner of the farm Qin Zhijun, 44, had an average income of more than 100,000 yuan (12,340 US dollars) every year.

"I have been raising chickens for 20 years, but I had never seen chickens dying like that," Qin said.

On Oct. 14, Qin found his chickens dead for no apparent reason and made a report to the local government. When the dead chickens were proved to have died of bird flu, all the 7,000 poultry and birds were killed in two days. Meanwhile, the local government ordered closure of the farm and a three kilometers radius around it.

The area within five to eight kilometers radius from the farm was considered "bird-flu-threatened" and all poultry in the area should receive vaccination.

"At first, it was hard to bear," said Qin. ``I did not feel like eating, nor sleeping. I was frustrated."

"Now I have thought it over and over again. I believe the government will not leave us alone. We could still start from scratch again."

Qin said his wife and he himself are fortunate enough to stay healthy. Nevertheless, the couple are still under medical monitoring and not allowed to leave the courtyard. Doctors come to take their temperatures every week.

After the outbreak of bird flu in the region, a total of 25 people in close contact with dead poultry and their dejecta received medical monitoring and 11 of them have been relieved of monitoring. The other 14 are in good condition, said a local government official.

China has not reported any human infection of bird flu so far.

There are 380 households in Tengjiaying Village. Only Qin has a poultry farm. Many other households in the village breed cows, a backbone industry in the region.

Qi Xiuzhi, 50, is a neighbour of Qin. Qi has raised two chickens herself. But they had been killed together with other poultry in the village after the outbreak of the disease.

"Every one knows there is something wrong with Qin's poultry," said Qi.

Qi said there were days when panic hung over the village and relatives outside the village dared not come for visit. "It's over now," Qi said.

Apart from checkpoints, the ground covered with lime powder, and a notice of closure on the wall, the village is not different from any other small village in China.

Seeing so many people with protective suits coming in, especially some foreigners with blue eyes and big noses, villagers stood far away, watching, chatting with each other in dialect, and laughing loudly. No one wore protective suits like reporters.

As the village has been under closure, villagers have to pass checkpoints after being disinfected and registered every day when they go out and come back.

"It's troublesome," said a villager who declined to give his name, "But what else can we do? We know it's a contagious disease."

Qin said he knew he would lose a lot of money this time, even though the government had promised to pay compensation. But he said he wants to raise chickens after the disease dies out.

"What else can I do?" said Qin."It's all I know how to do."

The local government has promised to help farmers like Qin recover production by providing interest-free or low-interest loans to them and helping them build new coops.

Compensation will be paid to farmers, at an average of 30 yuan per chicken. The central government will cover 10 yuan while the local governments will cover the remainder.

Since Autumn this year, China has reported four cases of bird flu outbreaks in Anhui, Hunan, Inner Mongolia and the latest Liaoning province.
