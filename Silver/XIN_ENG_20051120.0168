Critics of Kenya's proposed new constitution on Sunday accused President Mwai Kibaki of breaching electoral laws by campaigning for the draft hours after campaign time elapsed ahead of the Monday balloting.

President Kibaki, in a televised address late Sunday called on his countrymen to vote for the proposed constitution, sparking protests from his rivals and lawyers, who accused him of breaching electoral laws by campaigning after the campaign period elapsed.

"We do not expect him (Kibaki) to indulge in campaigns. The law says campaigns should have ended on Saturday (48 hours) before the material voting day but should he go ahead and campaign, we shall demand a similar opportunity," said Roads Minister Raila Odinga.

In a televised address to the nation, Kibaki urged Kenyans to come out and vote so that the outcome of the referendum will reflect their real wishes.

He expressed confidence that the new constitution creates a good environment for faster growth countrywide.

"As we go to vote tomorrow, we will be making a critical decision that will impact on the current and future generations. I urge you, therefore, not to let this historic opportunity pass without your participation," Kibaki said.

But Odinga, who is leading the "No" campaign opposing to the adoption of the new constitution, said his criticism of the Kibaki should not be construed to mean disrespect for him as the head of state.

The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) also criticized the move by the president to campaign for the draft constitution hours after the campaign period elapsed.

"In respect of free choice, we ask the president to exercise reason," said LSK Chairman Tom Ojienda.

President Kibaki, while addressing the nation, recalled that the journey to a new constitutional dispensation has been long and torturous.

"We have been seeking a constitution that would unify our country and enable us to realize our aspirations for a more prosperous and peaceful country," the Kenyan leader said in Kiswahili.

He reiterated that the government has put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of all Kenyans during the referendum.

He urged citizens to shun violence and respect the rights of others to have differing opinions, saying Kenya was a great country that has overcome many challenges in the past.

After several weeks of highly charged, divisive campaigns between those supporting the new constitution and those against, 11.6 million Kenyans will finally vote in the referendum on Monday.
