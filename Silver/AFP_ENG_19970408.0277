Beijing warned Tuesday that all countries supporting an anti-China motion submitted by Denmark to the UN Commission on Human Rights would "adversely affect" their relations with the Asian giant.

"Supporting this resolution will not be beneficial to any nation's ties with China," said foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang.

"We hope that these European countries can look at overall bilateral relations and not continue with confrontation on the human rights issue."

Denmark sparked sharp criticism from China on Monday after it announced plans to sponsor a motion condemning Beijing at the annual sitting of the human rights commission in Geneva.

"If the Danish government does not listen to China's advice and continues with its motion, this will definitely deteriorate bilateral relations and will affect all areas of exchange and cooperation," Shen said.

"This issue can only be solved through discussion, and confrontation is not a solution. Whoever proposes this motion will in the end be the greatest loser," he added.

Denmark announced Saturday it would put forward a motion critical of China's human rights record after the European Union was unable to agree on a joint position.

The EU had previously sponsored a critical resolution on China in Geneva every year since the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in 1989, but the common stance this year was blocked by France.

France was supported by at least four of other European nations, prompting criticism that they were putting trade with China before moral considerations.

"France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece and Japan have decided not to support the anti-China resolution at the United Nations human rights commission. We think this decision is sensible," Shen said.

"We hope that those countries that continue to support the anti-China resolution will carefully examine the majority view in the commission or they will adversely affect their China ties," he warned.

The Danish motion is expected to have the backing of at least 11 EU states as well as the United States.

Beijing showered Paris and Rome with compliments Monday for their stance, and in a bid to show that dialogue was the way forward, announced to visiting French Defence Minister Charles Millon that China would sign at least one UN human rights convention before the end of the year.

President Jiang Zemin committed China to sign the UN convention on economic, social and cultural rights before the end of the year, and said a second UN convention on civil and political rights was under consideration.

Human rights groups reacted guardedly Tuesday to Jiang's reported promise.

"One has to see it as positive, but at the same time note that they (China) said the same thing at the same time last year. ... We would first like to see it happen," said Robyn Kilpatrick, Amnesty International's spokesperson in Hong Kong.

Kilpatrick also cautioned that China had already signed up to other covenants, covering the rights of the child and elimination of discrimination against women and of the use of torture, but had still been repeatedly accused of abuse.

Paul Harris, chairman of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, said he felt "total skepticism."

"The timing is obviously designed to influence thinking at the human rights commission. I'm extremly doubtful as to whether it will happen," he said. "I think this is just a statement designed to fool a few gullible people."

Both Kilpatrick and Harris agreed, however, that if Jiang did carry out his promise, it would be good news for Hong Kong.

It would oblige Beijing to follow the British tradition of reporting to the convention's committee every two years on the situation in the territory, they said.
