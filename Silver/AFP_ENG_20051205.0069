The former chief executive of Deutsche Boerse, Werner Seifert, is to publish a book attacking the hedge fund investors who forced him to quit as head of the German stock exchange in May, the Financial Times reported on Monday.

However, senior Deutsche Boerse figures believe that the book, to be published under the title "Invasion of the Locusts", could contravene the terms of Seifert's 10-million-euro (12-million-dollar) pay-off, possibly triggering legal action against him, the newspaper said.

In a spectacular boardroom coup in May, hedge funds, including London-based TCI, ousted Seifert over his plans for the Frankfurt stock exchange to take over the London Stock Exchange.

In the book, to be subtitled "Intrigues, Power Battles and Market Manipulation", Seifert offers a chronological narrative of the LSE bid battle, as well as a broader critical analysis directed against the growing power of such investors and the consequences for companies, FT said, quoting sources involved in the project.

The "locusts" of the title refers to the term the former head of the Social Democrat SPD party, Franz Muentefering, used for such investors, who bought up companies in Germany stripped them of their assets and then moved on.

The newspaper said Seifert believed the scope of the book falls outside the gagging order that Deutsche Boerse tried to impose on him in exchange for his pay-off.

But FT quoted a company director as saying the book was a "scandal" and that the stock exchange operator would seek to prevent or at least delay publication.
