Members of a Muslim group notorious for its anti-vice raids on nightclubs will help safeguard churches over Christmas in Indonesia amid fears that extremists may strike, a report said Wednesday.

The Islamic Defenders' Front (FPI) will join other groups including youths from the country's largest Muslim organisation Nahdlatul Ulama, to help guard churches on Christmas Eve, said senior member Alawi Usman.

"We will be involved directly to show that relations between religious communities are good," he was quoted as saying by the state Antara news agency.  He said group members, many of whom wear white Islamic skullcaps and turbans, would be advised against staying too close to churches they were guarding as they could be suspected by police as potential trouble-makers.     "They are free to wear or to take off their FPI paraphernalia," Usman said.

The FPI has in the past made a number of high-profile attacks on Jakarta nightspots which it accused of harboring sex workers and drug dealers.

Its leader Habib Mohammad Rizieq Shihab was jailed for seven months in 2003 in connection with the raids.

Indonesia's intelligence agency warned earlier this month that information indicated extremists may be planning attacks over the Christmas-New Year period in large cities across the world's most populous Muslim nation.

Nineteen people were killed when Islamic extremists launched a coordinated nationwide bombing campaign targeting churches and priests on Christmas Eve in 2000. The campaign was the first major attack to be blamed on the al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah regional network.

Since then the group has launched a string of bloody attacks, including the 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people, mostly western holidaymakers.

Jakarta police have said they will deploy 18,000 officers over the period this year.

The country's intelligence chief also warned Tuesday that extremists were planning to kidnap high-ranking officials in an apparent shift away from bombings.
