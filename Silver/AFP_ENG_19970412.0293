Thirteen drug traffickers, also accused of armed robbery and murder, have been simultaneously hanged in southeastern Iran, newspapers reported Saturday.

The "international traffickers," all of them Iranian, had killed or wounded several policemen in clashes with security forces in Sistan- Baluchestan province bordering Afghanistan, the papers said.

They did not say on which day the hangings took place.

It was the highest number of people executed at the same time for several years.

In a separate incident, Iranian police said Saturday they had seized more than half a ton of opium hidden in cars in the northeastern towns of Torbat Jam and Tayyebad.

The official IRNA news agency said three grenades and an automatic rifle were also seized after routine checks.

Iran is a transit route for drugs coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan destined for Europe.

Iranian authorities have stepped up the fight against drug trafficking in recent years, and anybody possessing more than 30 grammes of heroin or five kilos of opium faces the death penalty.
