Newly-minted US Defense Secretary Robert Gates takes control of the Department of Defense Monday, facing deepening divisions among government officials and policy experts about handling violence-torn Iraq.

Gates, a 63-year-old seasoned Washington insider who owes much of his career to president George Bush, the father of the current US leader, will be sworn in at a Pentagon ceremony just three days after his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, who is blamed for the current mess in Iraq, was given a full-honors send-off.

The former Central Intelligence Agency director, known for his professionalism more than political skills, was offered the job one day after US voters, angry over the gruesome Iraqi carnage, stripped the Republican Party of its majority in both chambers of Congress in the November 7 elections.

Shortly thereafter, the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel of foreign policy luminaries, declared that the situation in Iraq was "grave and deteriorating" and recommended wrapping up US combat operations there by early 2008.

President George W. Bush, who has withheld a wholesale endorsement of the report, is expected to announced a new Iraq policy early next year.

Gates, who was confirmed in his new job by an overwhelming 95-2 US Senate vote on December 7, is likely to be involved in shaping this new strategy, but how much exactly remains unknown.

"There are a lot of people who are going to be involved in the process," White House spokesman Tony Snow said evasively when asked on Friday about Gates's future role.

"But, ultimately," added the press secretary, the president "is the one who has to make the important decisions."

Options under consideration reportedly include boosting the number of US soldiers in Iraq by between 20,000 and 50,000 to secure its chaotic capital, forge an alliance between moderate Iraqi Shiites and Sunnis at the expense of radicals on both sides, or even throwing the US lot with majority Shiites.

But advocates of the "victory-still-possible" approach received a bucketful of cold water Sunday from one of the chief architects of the allied victory in the 1991 Gulf War, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell.

Powell, who later went on the become secretary of state when the United States invaded Iraq, said that "we are losing" the war because US troops have been unable to quell the insurgency and stave off sectarian violence.

"If victory means you have gotten rid of every insurgent, you have peace throughout the country, I don't see that in the cards right now," the retired general told CBS News.

And he dismissed as unrealistic plans for throwing more troops into Iraq, arguing that "the American army isn't large enough to secure Baghdad."

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid for his part indicated he would be willing to support a troop increase only as a stop-gap measure tied to "a program to get us out of there ... by this time next year."

Supporters of sending more troops to Iraq, which also include Republican Senator John McCain, a potential 2008 presidential candidate, also face rising public opposition.

A Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg opinion pull conducted on December 8-11 found that 59 percent of Americans believed that Bush should adopt the Iraq Study Group's recommendation of reducing American troops by early 2008.

A similar survey conducted by ABC News and The Washington Post showed that only 17 percent of respondents supported the idea of boosting troop levels while 52 percent opposed it.

Some of non-governmental policy experts, meanwhile, have come to the conclusion the United States has now simply run out of good options.

"US policy in Iraq must come to grip with two realities: Iraq is in a civil war, and Iraq is a failed state," Carlos Pascual and Kenneth Pollack, two top Brookings Institution foreign policy experts wrote earlier this month.
