Pakistan and Russia Thursday agreed to further expand economic and trade cooperation between the two sides.

Addressing a joint press conference with Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri, visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said both the countries have agreed to launch the mechanism to activate Pakistan-Russia Joint Governmental Commission to promote economic and trade relations.

The Commission should meet regularly to review the ongoing projects and issues and explore possibility for further avenues of cooperation, the Russian foreign minister said.

The bilateral trade between Russia and Pakistan has more than doubled last year to over 500 million U.S. dollars, he said.

Kasuri said the bilateral contact between the two countries has increased substantially and the Joint Working Groups on bilateral cooperation, strategic stability and counter terrorism met early this year.

He said "excellent opportunities" for joint collaboration exist in sectors concerning Oil and Gas projects, expansion of Railways, construction of coal thermal and hydel power generating stations.

The Pakistani foreign minister also said Pakistan welcomed Russia's strong interest in Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) gas pipeline and were considering Russian participation in the project.
