Mongolian President Nambaryn Enkhbayar, who will start a week-long visit to China on Sunday, said here that his country is willing to promote bilateral relations with China.

"Mongolia's major foreign policy is to boost bilateral relations with China and Russia. Mongolia attaches importance to ties with China," Enkhbayar said in an interview with Xinhua before his trip to China.

"The political relationship between Mongolia and China has developed healthily," he noted.

He also said the bilateral economic and trade cooperation had seen rapid development and that his government is implementing big projects funded by Chinese loans.

Enkhbayar said that during his visit, the two sides would discuss how to expand cooperation in economy, trade and other fields.

He expressed his hope that China will participate and invest in Mongolia's infrastructure construction, such as railway, road and power facilities.

According to Enkhbayar, a delegation of Mongolian entrepreneurs will accompany him to China and will hold talks with their Chinese counterparts in the hope of attracting more Chinese investment.
