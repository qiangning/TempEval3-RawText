Sri Lanka's government budget for the year 2006 would be a "pro poor, pro-growth" budget and not election related, the Finance Minister Sarath Amunugama said here Monday.

The budget is to be presented in parliament on Tuesday amidst protests by the main opposition United National Party (UNP).

Amunugama said the Sri Lankan economy was now ready to take off from 6 percent growth and with the country's per capita income of 1,034 US dollars, Sri Lanka now had a place in the list of countries with "lower end of middle range income."

Referring to the pledges by both main candidates in the Nov. 17 presidential poll to achieve 8 to 10 percent growth, Amunugama said the foundation has been laid for such growth in the past year.

"Our emphasis will be on developing education, health, social benefits and better infrastructure," Amunugama said, adding that the preparation of the budget commenced long before the announcement of the presidential poll.

"The elections were not talked about when preparations began and it went through the normal routine process," Amunugama said.

The UNP charges that the budget would provide undue advantage to the ruling party candidate, the incumbent Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse.

The main opposition challenger and UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe met President Chandrika Kumaratunga asking to delay the presentation of the budget until after the election.

The UNP spokesman Tissa Attanayake told reporters here Monday that the government move was undemocratic and illegal but his party would not stage a boycott of the parliamentary session.
