Tens of thousands of mourners packed the rain-soaked streets of Belfast to say an emotional farewell to Northern Ireland's favourite son George Best on Saturday.

In what came close to a state funeral, Best's cortege drove from the family's humble home to the splendour of Stormont, the Northern Irish parliament, with the people of the province giving the soccer legend one last standing ovation as the hearse passed by.

Tears were shed along the route as fans from the working-class Protestant Cregagh estate and beyond said a final goodbye to their home-grown hero, the Belfast Boy who dazzled the world.

Flowers and football scarves were thrown onto the hearse before old teammates and his family carried the coffin into the palatial Parliament Buildings to the tune of a piper's lament as driving rain fell.

Three hundred guests squeezed into the Great Hall with the emotional service being broadcast to an expected 30,000 people allowed in the Stormont grounds.

Master of ceremonies Eamonn Holmes underlined Best's importance to Northern Ireland and the nature of the man who hit the highs of international stardom to the lows of wanton -- and equally public -- alcoholism.

Belfast-born broadcaster Holmes called Best "probably the greatest footballer who ever lived".

"In Ulster folklore we have many heroes, many legends. George Best will pass into that folklore as mercurial, as magical, as someone who made his dreams, and as someone who made our dreams come true.

"George would always recognise that however much a genius he may have been, he was also flawed. Maybe that imperfection made us love him more.

"In a country that often cannot rise above religion or politics, George Best did more than most to bring us together as a people. To make us recognise that maybe there is more that unites us than divides us.

"We want to show the world how delighted we are that he came from a country of just 1.5 million people and became the best footballer the world has ever seen."

Former teammates, ex-wives, dignitaries and friends filled the cream-marbled hall.

Fighting back the tears, Best's son Calum, 24, read Mary Frye's poem "Do not stand at my grave and weep."

Old United colleague Denis Law brought smiles as he reminisced on his pal Bestie's character and his battle against the illness that claimed his life.

Best died aged 59 on November 25 from multiple organ failure, after suffering a series of health problems in a London hospital.

The Best family earlier held a private ceremony at their home on the east Belfast estate where Best honed his skills against the terraced house walls.

The funeral cortege left shortly after 10:00 am (1000 GMT) from Cregagh, whose Loyalist paramilitary murals had been painted over and flags taken down for the occasion.

Mourners lined the length of the three-mile (five-kilometre) route to Stormont, which was selected as the site of a funeral for the first time because of the huge crowds expected.

"George was a Belfast boy," said Dawn Purvis, 39, secretary of a small Protestant political party, as she watched through the umbrellas while the cortege slowly left Cregagh.

"We all had an affinity for him. He had charisma, talent, but a great weakness too," she told AFP.

"In a way, he was a tragic hero."

Considered the first "pop-star" footballer, Best brought Northern Ireland a dash of glamour and sporting wizardry as it descended towards sectarian bloodshed.

Best is considered as being among football's finest ever players.

"Maradona good; Pele better; George Best" read a soaked flag at the end of Best's old street.

Best's alcoholism brought on a string of health problems which led to a liver transplant in 2002. He was back on the bottle within a year, however, despite having been told another drink could kill him.

Best made his professional debut for Manchester United in 1963, aged 17, going on to help the club become the first English side to lift the European Cup in 1968. In the same year he was voted European Player of the Year.

Dubbed "El Beatle", his playboy lifestyle involved an unquenchable thirst for alcohol and beautiful women.

He won 37 Northern Ireland caps before heavy boozing took its toll and he unexpectedly quit United for good at the early age of 28.

Best will be buried next to his mother, Ann, in the Roselawn cemetery in the Castlereagh hills overlooking east Belfast and the fields where he first shone as a footballer.
