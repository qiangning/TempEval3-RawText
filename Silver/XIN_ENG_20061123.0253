The African Union (AU) accused on Thursday a Darfur rebel group of attempting to attack its fuel convoys, saying such action will hinder peace efforts in the region.

In a statement received by Xinhua, the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) said it had received creditable information on a planned ambush against its fuel tankers travelling in the areas of Um Kadada and El Nahud near al-Fashir.

The statement said some elements of the National Redemption Front (NRF) were behind this potential attack.

"Such actions constitute flagrant violation of the ceasefire and negate current efforts of broadening the peace process and making it more inclusive," the statement stressed.

The pan-African body urged the NRF leadership to refrain its elements from undertaking such action.

Attacks against AU troops and aid workers in Darfur are now part of the shaky security in the region.

Last week, The AU slammed an attack by unidentified group against an AU monitor team near the Chadian border, in which the attackers seized a vehicle and communication radio.
