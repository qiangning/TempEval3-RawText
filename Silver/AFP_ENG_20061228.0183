Turkey's 4.0-percent inflation target for 2007 remains within reach despite the government's failure to rein in price increases this year, Economy Minister Ali Babacan said on Thursday.

"We believe the 4.0 percent target for 2007 is achievable," Babacan told a news conference, pledging that Ankara would stick to tight fiscal policies under an IMF-sponsored economic program.

Annual inflation in consumer prices stood at 9.86 percent in November, almost double the official target of 5.0 percent for the year-end.

Inflation in Turkey has been rising since the beginning of the year, pushed up by higher oil prices and a depreciation of the Turkish lira triggered by domestic political tensions and global capital flight from emerging markets.

Far-reaching IMF-backed reforms aiming to heal the scars of a severe economic crisis in 2001 have helped Ankara beat its inflation targets over the past three years, bringing the rate from 29.7 percent in 2002 to 7.7 percent in 2005.

Babacan dismissed concerns that the government would sacrifice fiscal discipline for populist policies ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year.

"Fiscal discipline will be maintained in 2007 with determination and with no concessions," he said.

The government, he said, will maintain its 6.5 percent target for the primary budget surplus, or surplus excluding debt repayments -- a key IMF condition.

Fighting inflation is a key element in a three-year economic stability program Turkey is implementing with the support of a 10-billion-dollar IMF loan.
