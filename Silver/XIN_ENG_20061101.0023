At least 16 people were killed and 62 others injured when two passenger buses collided head on in Bangladesh's northwestern Sirajganj district Wednesday, police said.

Primary report said the accident occurred when a bus from capital Dhaka lost control and crushed into another bus at about 11:15 am local time (5:15 GMT). Local people said the casualty figure may go up as conditions of some of the injured were critical.

The injured passengers were rushed to different hospitals and clinics nearby.

Police said most passengers of the two buses were returning to their work places after Muslim's Eid festival and subsequent political agitation that disrupted communications late last month.

The accident on highway is a regular feature in the country where bus drivers do not take much care of traffic rule while the traffic department does not monitor the speed limit of vehicles on roads.
