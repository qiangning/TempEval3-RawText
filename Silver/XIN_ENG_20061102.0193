Vanuatu Deputy Prime Minister Sato Kilman on Thursday reiterated his country's one- China policy, expressing satisfaction over the development of Vanuatu-China relations.

Kilman, also the South Pacific island country's foreign minister, told Xinhua here that all major political parties in Vanuatu support the one-China policy.

He said the Chinese government's endeavor towards a peaceful reunification of the country is not only conducive to the well- being of the peoples across the Taiwan Straits, but also to the peace in the region at large.

"The Chinese government has done a lot in this regard," he said.

He expressed his appreciation over China's assistance to Vanuatu, saying the Chinese medical teams, agricultural teams and sports coaches have earned respect from the Vanuatu people.

Kilman welcomed Chinese tourists to his country as one of the ways to further boost the bilateral cooperation.

He spoke highly of the role of the Chinese community, which is about 400 to 500 out of the country's 200,000 population, in the local social and economic life.

"It is the Chinese business people who helped Vanuatu's development," he noted, adding the country values very much the Chinese community's contribution to the economy.
