Afghan President Hamid Karzai used the start of the Islamic Eid festival Saturday to again call on Taliban-led rebels to end their insurgency, which he said was being directed by "strangers".

Karzai made the call after leading some of his cabinet and other officials to Eid al-Adha prayers in a busy mosque in the centre of the city, a departure from his routine of praying inside the heavily defended presidential compound.

"I call upon those who are still committing acts against their land, those who are still acting on orders of strangers in the destruction of their land, to give up fighting," Karzai told reporters.

The president this month accused the government of neighbouring Pakistan of trying to turn his countrymen into "slaves", in his strongest words yet blaming Islamabad for the wave of insurgent violence.

Pakistan has angrily denied the allegations.

The insurgency launched after the Taliban were toppled in a US-led offensive in late 2001 has been at its fiercest this year, with the militants showing new sophistication and launching deadly attacks in the heart of the capital.

The violence has claimed nearly 4,000 lives this year, with most of the dead rebel fighters.

Karzai regularly calls on Taliban foot soldiers to lay down their arms and join a government reconciliation programme.

In his message for Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammand Omar on Friday praised his followers' sacrifices in their campaign and said they would never accept defeat.
