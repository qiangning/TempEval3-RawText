New Zealand is among the countries bucking an international trend of declining greenhouse gas levels.

Local media said Sunday that a report from the United Nations Climate Centre shows New Zealand's emissions have increased 22.5 percent since 1990.

Worldwide there has been a 5.9 percent drop over the same period.

New Zealand has the eighth highest percentage greenhouse gas increase among the nations listed in the report.

Nearly half its emissions come from the agriculture sector.

However there has been a huge increase in the level of discharges from transport since 1990.

The figures appear in a report from the United Nations body, ahead of the international climate change conference in Montreal later this month.

New Zealand is among the worst offenders, behind Spain, Monaco, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Canada and Australia, said the report.
