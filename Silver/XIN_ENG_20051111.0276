Two UN investigators met with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud Friday night over the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and took a statement from Lahoud, according to the presidential office.

The investigators came to the presidential palace in Baabda to take the statement.

A UN commission said in an interim report last month that Lahoud was not a suspect in the Feb. 14 killing, but a suspect made a call to the president's phone minutes before the blast.

The report claimed that investigations found "converging evidence" of both Syrian and Lebanese involvement in Hariri's killing.

Syria has denied any role in the murder and dismissed the findings as politically motivated.

The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Oct. 31, demanding Syria cooperate fully with the UN probe or face possible "further action."

Chief UN investigator Detlev Mehlis is scheduled to present a final report to the United Nations on the probe on Dec. 15.
