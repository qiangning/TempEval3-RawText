Macedonia's president on Wednesday sent a letter to his French counterpart pleading for Paris to reverse its stance against the former Yugoslav republic gaining official EU candidacy.

"The citizens of Macedonia believe in Europe and believe in France. Candidacy would be a huge opportunity, but an obligation as well," President Branko Crvenkovski said in the letter to France's Jacques Chirac.

Crvenkovski made the appeal ahead of a summit Thursday of EU leaders in Brussels, at which the tiny Balkan state was hoping to be granted the official status of a candidate for EU membership.

France has emerged as the most vocal opponent of Macedonia's official candidacy as the 25-nation bloc struggles to reach an agreement over its 2007-2013 budget plans.

In his letter, the Macedonian president said Skopje "fully understands" the problems that Brussels faces, but added he believed that giving his country the status would represent a "victory" for Europe.

"I am addressing you as the president of France, a state that has always actively supported ... Macedonia on its path towards Europe," Crvenkovski told Chirac in the letter.

"Your personal contribution has been an integral part of my country to get to the place where it belongs -- in the European family" of nations, he said.

"Macedonia does not fear for its future and expects the European Council in Brussels to confirm all of our achievements by giving us candidate status for EU membership," said Crvenkovski, referring to the pace of reforms in the country since the end of an ethnic Albanian uprising in 2001.

French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy has said Paris was questioning Macedonia's candidacy because it would "send a signal to the public... that we are heading for more enlargement".

French and Dutch voters rejected the European Union's carefully prepared constitution earlier this year, plunging the bloc into its deepest political crisis.
