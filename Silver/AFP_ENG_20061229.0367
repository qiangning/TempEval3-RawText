The Milwaukee Brewers signed veteran righthander Jeff Suppan to a four-year contract on Friday, a deal worth a reported 42 million dollars.

Suppan, who will turn 32 next Tuesday, became the latest pitcher to cash in during what has been a lucrative offseason for free agents.

He raised his stock over the last two months after going 1-1 with a 2.49 ERA in four postseason starts with the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals.

The signing of Suppan came one day after the San Francisco Giants signed Barry Zito to a multi-year deal worth a reported 126 million dollars - the largest contract for a pitcher in major-league history.

The Most Valuable Player of the NL championship series, Suppan went 12-7 with a 4.12 ERA in 32 starts last season for the Cardinals.

The righthander is 44-26 with a 3.95 ERA over the past three years, posting consecutive 16-win campaigns in 2004 and 2005.

"With 44 wins in the last three seasons, Jeff is not only a proven winner, he is also one of the most durable pitchers in baseball," Brewers general manager Doug Melvin said. "This agreement makes us feel very good about the depth of our rotation. Jeff's experience and durability should have a positive influence on our entire pitching staff."

Suppan will join a Brewers' rotation which includes lefthander Chris Capuano and righthanders Ben Sheets, Dave Bush and Claudio Vargas, who was acquired for starter Doug Davis in a trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks on November 25.

In 12 seasons with the Boston Red Sox, Kansas City Royals, Arizona, Pittsburgh and St. Louis, Suppan is 106-101 with a 4.60 ERA in 317 career games. He has made at least 31 starts in each of the last eight years.
