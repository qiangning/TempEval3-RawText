Venezuela's firebrand anti-US President Hugo Chavez headed to reelection Sunday, according to an exit poll conducted for the government in voting marked by a large turnout.

Evans/McDonough said the leftist leader's advantage over state governor Manuel Rosales was comparable to the institute's previous voter intention surveys that had Chavez leading by up to 19 percentage points.

The US pollsters conducted the exit poll on behalf of a company owned by the state-run Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) group, which is headed by the country's energy minister.

Chavez underlined the high turnout and said he expected "democratic results."

The controversial president, who has been in office for eight years, has pledged to consolidate his self-styled revolution and launch a new socialist era in the oil-rich but poverty-plagued South American country.

A former paratrooper who once led a failed military coup, Chavez, 52, has survived a two-day ouster, a recall referendum and a massive oil strike aimed at forcing him to step down.

Flush with petrodollars, he has vowed to boost social programs that have kept him popular among the millions of impoverished Venezuelans who played a key role in giving him a landslide electoral victory in 1998 and again in 2000.

He has cultivated his image as a virulent critic of US President George W. Bush, whom he called the devil incarnate before the UN General Assembly.

At the same time, Venezuela exports about half its daily oil production of more than three million barrels a day to the United States.

After voting on Sunday, Chavez insisted Venezuela wanted the best relations with all countries, "including the United States," and hailed as a good signal a statement by a US State Department official recognizing that the South American country waged its political battles through democratic institutions.

A close ally of Cuban President Fidel Castro, the leftist leader had accused Washington during his campaign of seeking to sew discord in Venezuela, and denounced his electoral rival as a lackey of the "US empire."

Rosales, for his part, claimed Chavez planned to turn Venezuela into a communist state and called him "a puppet seated on Castro's lap."

The opposition candidate, who temporarily stepped down as governor of Zulia state to run in the election, said he stood for "a new social democracy, with liberty and social justice" and wanted to distance Venezuela from US foes, including Iran.

Sixteen million people were eligible to vote in the presidential election, which capped a busy electoral year in which five leftist presidents were voted into office or won another term in Latin America.

Chavez, who had been accused of meddling in some of the Latin American elections, hailed the recent leftist victories, which he said would give impetus to his plan for regional integration he hopes will further lessen US influence in the region.

Voting concluded in some areas shortly after 4:00 pm (2000 GMT) although by law polling stations cannot shut their doors before the last person in line has voted.
