Two Palestinians were killed Tuesday in clashes with Israeli settlers and soldiers in Hebron after an Israeli-US summit meeting failed to offer hope for a quick end to the Mideast peace crisis.

The violence began when two Israeli settlers killed a Palestinian with submachinegun fire in Hebron's central market after they said the man attacked them with tear gas spray, police said.

The settlers were detained by Israeli police.

Several hundred angry Palestinians responded to the killing by throwing stones and firebombs at Israeli soldiers, drawing volleys of rubber bullets that killed a second man and wounded more than 80, one critically, officials said.

Palestinian hospital officials said they had also received Palestinians with wounds from live ammunition fired by Israeli soldiers, apparently after they were targetted by dozens of firebombs during several hours of rioting.

Qassem Rashad Kamel Arafa, 24, was pronounced dead at a Hebron hospital with several of the settlers' bullets in his chest. A second man was killed by a rubber bullet which entered his brain while a third man was in critical condition on a life support system in a Jerusalem hospital, officials said.

The Israeli army reported four soldiers had been hurt by stones.

"We were just walking through the market when suddenly the settler began shooting," said one witness who asked not to be identified.

A third settler was arrested by Israeli forces after firing his gun at stonethrowers, a police spokesman said.

The army sent in reinforcements and imposed a curfew on the fifth of Hebron still under its control following the transfer of most of the flashpoint West Bank city to Palestinian rule in January, officials said.

Palestinian police tried ineffectively to prevent protestors from entering the Israeli area during the clashes, but Israeli security officials complained that not enough was done to curb the rioters.

Palestinian West Bank security chief Jibril Rajub lashed out in return at the 400 settlers who live in army-guarded enclaves amid Hebron's 120,000 Arab residents.

"This is an organized crime encouraged by the Israeli government," he told reporters following Arafa's funeral.

"What happened today shows there can be no coexistence between us and Israeli settlers, who are here against our will and against all laws. This is terrorism itself."

The violence followed talks in Washington Monday between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Bill Clinton organized as part of a US push to resolve the crisis caused by Israel's decision to begin work last month on a new Jewish settlement at Abu Ghneim in disputed east Jerusalem.

Netanyahu defiantly rebuffed demands he halt settlement activity to restore Palestinian confidence in the peace process and insisted the only way back to negotiations was through a Palestinian clampdown on the violence which erupted following construction at Abu Ghneim.

"The construction will carry on, whether it is the Har Homa suburb or in the territories" of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Netanyahu said.

A spokesman for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the Hebron killing was "an immediate result of the policies of Mr Netanyahu."

"I hope he is happy to have this blood on his hands," he said.

Arafat said Netanyahu's refusal to halt settlement expansion "means that he doesn't want peace."

The Palestinian frustrations were echosed by US officials, with State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns saying the peace process was in "a very difficult impasse, a critical point."

Palestinians spoke in despairing terms of the situation.

"We all thought the prime minister would find ways in Washington to give the people of the area the feeling that peace is prevailing, but on the contrary he kept to his ways of deception and distorting facts," Kanafani said.

"We are extemely upset by this," he said.

But Palestinian officials said they would still send a high-level delegation to Washington this week as requested by Clinton to pursue efforts to save the peace.
