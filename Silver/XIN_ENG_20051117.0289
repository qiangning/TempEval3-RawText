Chinese President Hu Jintao on Thursday expounded China's stance on win-win cooperation by urging the APEC member economies to increase mutual understanding through communications and to strengthen cooperation while seeking greater mutual understanding.

Delivering a speech entitled "An Open Mind for Win-Win Cooperation" at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in South Korea's southeastern port city of Busan, the Chinese president said that building a harmonious world with an open mind is a basic prerequisite to win-win cooperation.

Hu arrived on Thursday in Busan, the second largest city in South Korea, to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting scheduled on Friday and Saturday with the main theme of this year--"Toward One Community: Meet the Challenge, Make the Change."

Meanwhile, the three-day APEC CEO summit was kicked off here on Thursday morning.

The summit is an annual event that gives business leaders from the Asia-Pacific region to participate in highly interactive discussions on regional and global economic and trade issues with APEC Economic Leaders, economists, policy makers and fellow business leaders.

The theme of this year's APEC CEO Summit is: "Entrepreneurship and Prosperity: Building a Successful Partnership in the Asia-Pacific Region."

Hu also termed "deepening mutual trust and expanding trade and economic exchanges" as a solid foundation for win-win cooperation.

China encourages well-established Chinese businesses to go global and, within the framework of market rules and laws and in the principle of reciprocity, mutual benefit and complementarity, participate in international economic and technological cooperation and competition, Hu added.

"Setting store by dialogue and consultation, and seeking a proper settlement of disputes is also an important avenue to win-win cooperation," the Chinese president said.

He also described strengthening solidarity and coordination, and maintaining security and stability as an effective guarantee for win-win cooperation.

Non-traditional security issues, such as terrorism, financial risks and natural disasters, are posing a threat to the very existence and development of mankind, Hu said.

STRENGTHEN DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION TO MAINTAIN WORLD ENERGY SECURITY

The Chinese president pledged to strengthen energy dialogue and cooperation with all countries, to jointly maintain world energy security and stability.

"To achieve balanced and orderly growth in the world economy, the international community must handle well the energy issue," Hu told some 800 APEC business leaders.

Since 2004, the Chinese president said, the surge of oil prices in the international market has affected the economic growth of the world economy, developing countries in particular.

"The most critical thing is for all countries to work together for stability of the world energy market, and to fuel the sustained growth of the world economy with sufficient, safe, economical and clean energy resources," the Chinese president said.

It is also important to take a long-term perspective, intensify energy development, deepen energy cooperation, increase energy efficiency, and facilitate the development and use of new energy resource, Hu added.

The Chinese president also briefed the APEC business leaders on China's energy strategy.

"The core of China's energy strategy has been clearly defined. We will strengthen policy guidance for energy conservation and high efficiency, give priority to energy conservation and rely on domestic resources," Hu said.

"While focusing on developing coal resources, we will develop diverse energy resources, and put in place a system that supplies stable, economical and clean energy," he added.

The development of nuclear, wind and bio-power in China has just started, and there is great potential for future development, Hu noted.

Though China's demand for energy has somewhat increased due to its steady economic growth, its consumption volume in per capita is not high, the Chinese president pointed out.

"China is a major energy consumer. But it is also a major energy producer," Hu told the business leaders.

Since the 1990s, China has always met over 90 percent of its overall energy needs on its own. As a country with coal dominating its energy structure, China still has huge potential for domestic supply.

Hu also briefed the APEC business leaders on China's energy conservation.

"We always work to combine energy development with conservation, and give top priority to conservation," he added.

Hu told the business leaders that China has introduced a mid-and long-term energy conservation program, with the objective of saving 3 percent of energy every year by 2020, or 1.4 billion tons of standard coal in total savings.

MAKING FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO A SUSTAINED EXPANSION OF GLOBAL TRADE

Hu also said that China will make further contributions to a sustained expansion of global trade by changing the mode of foreign trade growth, increasing import and enhancing the protection of intellectual property rights.

He said although China has a trade surplus with some regions, it has a deficit with the Asia-Pacific region, Hu said.

Among China's top 10 sources of trade deficit of 2004, six are in the Asia-Pacific region, and the deficit totaled 127 billion US dollars.

"It is not true that China is seeking a big surplus in foreign trade. As a matter of fact, the enormous domestic demand and the broad internal market are the perpetual driving force behind China's economic development," Hu told the business leaders.

Hu also pointed out that global trade imbalance should be viewed from a dialectical perspective and in the context of world economic development.

"International trade expansion has helped optimize the allocation of global resources, and promoted world economic development as well as the well-being of the people of all countries,"Hu said.

Among the CEOs to attend the APEC CEO Summit are Citigroup Chairman William Rhodes, Microsoft Vice President Craig Mundie and Chevron Managing Director Samuel Snyder, along with top executives from Toyota, China Unicom and Hong Kong's Li and Fung Ltd.

CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT NOT TO POSE THREAT TO OTHERS

Hu said China's development will not stand in the way of anyone, nor will it pose any threat to anyone.

"Instead, it will only do good to peace, stability and prosperity of the world,"Hu said.

"China is becoming an important driving force behind the economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole," Hu added.

China's economic development not only benefits the Chinese people, but also provides the whole world with more investment opportunities and a bigger market, he added.

"We will continue to take economic development as our central task and top priority, concentrate on development, and work hard to achieve our goals and, at the same time, make our own contributions to regional and global economic developments," he said.

China will continue to purse the basic state policy of opening-up, conduct extensive international cooperation, steadily improve its investment environment, open its market, and endeavor to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results with the whole world, he added.

Since its inception in 1989 in response to the growing interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies, APEC has become a formidable regional forum acting as the primary regional vehicle for promoting open trade and practical economic and technical cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

APEC accounts for more than one-third of the world's population (2.6 billion people), about 60 percent of world GDP and nearly half of world trade.

It represents the most economically dynamic region in the world, having generated nearly 70 percent of global economic growth in its first 10 years.

APEC currently has 21 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, China's Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

The chairmanship rotates among its members, with South Korea holding the chair this year.
