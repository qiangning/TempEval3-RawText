More than 96 percent of quake affectees in northern Pakistan's quake-hit areas have been given compensation for housing, a senior official of Pakistan's Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Authority (ERRA) said Thursday.

The construction of over 200,000 houses was under progress in various quake affected areas while the reconstruction work of all the 600,000 damaged houses would be completed by 2008, said Nadeem Ahmed, Deputy Chairman of ERRA, while addressing newsmen in Islamabad.

ERRA has prepared a comprehensive plan for the quake survivors living in 41 camps in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and three camps in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) to provide them best possible protection during the coming cold season, Nadeem said, while answering a question.

A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck South Asia on Oct. 8, 2005, leaving over 73,000 people dead and some 3.5 million homeless in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and NWFP.
