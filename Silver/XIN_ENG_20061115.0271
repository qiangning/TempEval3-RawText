The Uganda People's Defense Force (UPDF) has started withdrawing its troops from parts of southern Sudan as the ongoing peace talks between the government and the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) progress, a statement said here on Wednesday.

The statement signed by the army spokesman Maj. Felix Kulayigye said the troops have started withdrawing from areas neighboring Owiny-Ki-Bul, one of the two assembly points in southern Sudan, where the LRA are supposed to gather.

According to the statement, the withdrawal was ordered by the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, which the UPDF has effective November 13 withdrawn from Magwi, Palutaka and Tibika.

The UPDF said the move is to prove the government and the army is committed to the peace talks in Juba, southern Sudan, to bring an end to the 20 year conflict in northern Uganda.

According to the cessation of hostilities agreement between the government and the rebels, the LRA fighters are supposed to assemble at Owiny-Ki-Bul and Ri-Kwangba in southern Sudan. But the rebels refused to assemble at Owiny-Ki-Bul, citing the UPDF's presence as a threat to their safety.

Kulayigye said the army has withdrawn from the areas which are in a radius of about 30 to 40km from Owiny-Ki-Bul to facilitate the Juba talks.

"We shall continue to fully support the peace process going on in Juba, for the sake of our people in northern Uganda. This is continued testimony to our serious resolve to end the conflict in northern part of our country," said the statement.

"It remains our hope that the LRA will conform to the agreement and assemble in Ri-Kwangba and Owiny-Ki-Bul," it concluded.

Kulayigye noted that the army shall continue to maintain its other positions as per the 2002 understanding with Sudanese government, which allowed the UPDF to enter southern Sudan to flush out the LRA fighter who had their bases there.

The government of southern Sudan is currently mediating the talks, which are seen as the best chance to end the insurgency in northern Uganda that has left tens of thousands of people dead and over 1.4 million displaced.
