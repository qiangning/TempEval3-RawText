German chancellor-designate Angela Merkel pledged here Thursday to bring Germany's budget deficit down by 2007 to meet the 3-percent rule that the European Union stipulated for the 12-nation euro-zone.

"It is not just meeting the ... criteria - this is a question of justice for the future," said Merkel in a speech to business leaders.

Germany has violated the 3 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP) euro-zone budget deficit rule for a fourth year in a row in 2005 and many experts expect further violation next year.

Merkel said her government would make 35 billion euros (42 billion US dollars) of spending cuts in the coming months, but adding the need to reach the goal "rests on assumptions for which we have to do something first" and "rests on the assumption that we will have 1.8 percent growth and the hope that we will end the spiral of losing 1,000 full-time jobs per day".

Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/CSU alliance and outgoing Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party ( SPD) are negotiating on the formation of a grand coalition government with Merkel as the next chancellor. A new government is expected to be in place later this month.

The German government said last month that Germany's GDP will grow 1.2 percent next year, less than the 1.6 percent it predicted in its last official forecast in April. It also lowered its projection for growth this year to 0.8 percent from 1 percent.
