Share prices rebounded 0.9 percent on the Korea Stock Exchange on Friday, with buying interest emerging on undervalued stocks after a short correction, dealers said.

"Investors returned to the market after a correction, with individual stocks with respective themes at the centre of buying activity," Cho Hung Securities analyst Choi Youn-Gun said.

The composite index gained 5.90 points to finish at 693.94.

Turnover totalled 44.1 million shares worth 627 billion won (704 million dollars). Advancers led decliners 530 to 260 with 117 shares unchanged.

The market's basic tone was strong largely due to expectations of inflows of fresh funds after the planned expansion of the foreign shareholding limit on May 1, the analyst said.

The banking sector closed lower on rumours that Jinro Group had financial problems, dealers said. Commercial Bank Bank slid 200 won at 4,000 won and Korea Exchange Bank went down 130 won at 5,400 won.

Jinro Industries was limit-down 470 won at 5,410 won on rumours that Jinro Group's unlisted construction unit was on the verge of bankruptcy, dealers said.

Blue chips were mixed with Samsung Electronics unchanged at 62,900 won and LG Semicon up 600 won at 29,800 won.

Automakers performed well, with Kia Motors up 300 won at 15,300 won and Ssangyong Motor adding 190 won at 5,540 won. Hyundai Motor closed unchanged at 23,000 won.
