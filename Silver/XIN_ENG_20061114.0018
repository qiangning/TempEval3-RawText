The Philippines will deploy some 7, 000 policemen for the Association of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) Summit to be held in Cebu City, the police chief said on Tuesday.

Police forces will secure the arrival and the departure of all the delegates of the summit in December, Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Oscar Calderon told reporters in a press conference at Camp Crame, PNP headquarters in the capital.

Calderon said that the police could not rule out the possibility that international and local terrorist groups might take advantage of the event.

"But with the preparations we've been conducting, there will be no threat. And as of now, there is no threat. Cebu is safe like Metro Manila," he said, referring to the second largest city of the country.

The Philippines is now the yearly chairman country of ASEAN and the host of the 12th ASEAN Summit and its related meetings scheduled in early December.
