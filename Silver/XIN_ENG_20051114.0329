US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived here Monday evening to show support to Jordan's anti- terror campaign following last Wednesday's deadly suicide bombings in the Jordanian capital.

"There is no justification for the wanton killing of innocents and we stand in solidarity with the people of Jordan," Rice told reporters during a visit to Radisson SAS hotel, one of three attacked hotels, where at least 20 people were killed.

"We will all stand until terrorism is defeated and until those who simply want to live a normal life and to live in peace can return to the days when this sort of tragedy, this sort of outrage does not happen," she added.

Meanwhile, Jordan's state-run Petra news agency reported that King Abdullah II reaffirmed in his meeting with Rice that the bombings will not "dissuade Jordan from its active role in supporting peace and security to prevail in the region."

"Terrorism does not only target Jordan, but the whole international community and this requires efforts of all to fight it," Abdullah was quoted as saying.

Rice also discussed the Mideast peace process with the king and briefed him on talks she held earlier in the day with Palestinian and Israeli leaders, the report said.

Rice flew into Amman from Jerusalem.

Al-Qaida branch in Iraq claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings on three Amman hotels, which killed 57 people and wounded over 100.
