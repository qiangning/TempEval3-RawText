No conclusion has been reached yet in the one-on-one meeting between the delegations of Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and they pledged to continue the talks, said head of the DPRK delegation Song Il-Ho here Thursday.

The two sides started their bilateral talks in the Chinese capital Thursday morning, aiming to settle the abduction issue and Japan's wartime compensation to the DPRK, he said.

Before the afternoon session, Song, also vice director of the Asian Affairs Department of the DPRK Foreign Ministry, told reporters they would possibly talk about the abduction issue in the afternoon.

The meeting between the two countries is to "solve problems," said Song, demanding that the Japanese government do something about its compensation for the past problems.

After the morning session, Song told reporters that both sides stated their positions during the opening session in a "good" atmosphere.

Akitaka Saiki, head of the Japanese delegation and deputy head of the Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, said the two sides had "serious exchanges on items of mutual concern."

Diplomatic sources here said the talks are expected to last at least two days.

Prior to the two-way talks between Japan and the DPRK, Li Bin, Chinese ambassador for Korean Peninsula Affairs, met with Akitaka Saiki Wednesday evening. They exchanged views on how to proceed in the next round of the six-party talks on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.
