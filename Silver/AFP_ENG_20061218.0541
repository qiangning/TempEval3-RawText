Violence flared in Gaza Monday despite a fragile truce between rival Palestinian factions, as president Mahmud Abbas, locked in a dangerous standoff with the ruling Hamas movement, vowed to press ahead with his controversial plans for early elections.

A member of Abbas's Fatah party was killed after gunmen fired on a welfare agency in northern Gaza in an attack that also wounded five other people, medics said.

Until the attack, a shaky late-night ceasefire appeared to be holding between the two rival groups battling for power in the volatile Palestinian territories, although sporadic gunfire rang out in the Gaza Strip.

Nine Fatah members, including senior official Sofiane Abu Zaida, and five Hamas loyalists were kidnapped during the day in the north of the coastal strip, according to officials and witnesses.

Zaida was later released after about two hours, and the others released shortly after that, a mediator said.

"The mediation to free all Fatah and Hamas hostages was successful and allowed security to improve and tensions to stop," said Islamic Jihad mediator Daud Shihab.

Abbas won support for his election plan from visiting Prime Minister Tony Blair, who appealed to the international community to back the moderate Palestinian president and called for an initiative to put the Middle East peace process back on track.

Abbas described the situation in the territories as a "grave internal crisis" after an explosion of deadly violence at the weekend following his high-stakes political challenge to Hamas.

"I have called for early presidential and parliamentary elections so that the people can decide on the base of an acceptable program to preserve their national interests ... and put an end to the siege and crisis," he said.

But he said the door was still open to forming a national unity government after Hamas vowed to boycott any elections, describing Abbas's move as a coup and tantamount to a call for civil war.

Abbas, who has been at loggerheads with Hamas since it trounced his Fatah party in January elections, also appealed for an end to the street violence.

"Any bullet shot anywhere is a loss for the Palestinian people and is not in our interest."

Blair, standing alongside Abbas at a Ramallah news conference, called for an initiative to support the Palestinians and move toward a two-state solution for the Middle East conflict.

"I hope therefore that we will be in a position over these coming weeks to put together an initiative that allows us both to give that support, in particular for reconstruction and development, and to alleviate the suffering and plight of the Palestinian people," Blair said.

"But also crucially that gives us a political framework within which we can move forward on that two-state solution."

"It's a critical moment," he said after later holding talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. "It's never been more important that we try to make progress."

A senior Palestinian official told AFP that the initiative announced by Blair would be worked out in coordination with the United States and be unveiled by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her expected visit to the region early next year.

The Palestinian territories have been plunged into their deepest ever financial crisis because of a Western aid freeze imposed after Hamas came to power in March.

Abbas has said elections were the way to resolve the turf war with Hamas, boycotted internationally because of its failure to recognize Israel, renounce violence and agree to past peace deals.

But he did not set a date and election officials said they would need 110 days to organize a ballot once Abbas issues an official decree.

The surge in unrest drew urgent appeals for restraint from across the globe.

Arab League chief Amr Mussa called the situation in the Palestinian territories "extremely dangerous" and called for an emergency meeting of foreign ministers next Sunday aimed at ending the fighting.

Israel -- which pulled out its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 but maintains control over its borders -- said that Abbas should be supported.

"There is no doubt that we have to support the moderates favorable to negotiations among the Palestinians ... and that everything should be done to reinforce Mahmud Abbas," Olmert said after talks with Blair.

Washington also rallied behind the Palestinian president on Monday.

"We support president Abbas in trying to work through this current impasse," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack.

"President Abbas is doing what he can, taking the steps that he thinks are prudent, to try to resolve this situation," McCormack said.

"And we certainly hope that the steps that he is taking can lead to a reduction in the violence."
