Highly praising the economic relations between the two countries, Lee was quoted by the official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) as saying that to enhance the economic ties with the oil-rich Kuwait was high on his agenda.

Lee also said he had discussed development of economic relations with his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al- Salem Al-Sabah and other top Kuwaiti officials during his visit.

"Ever since the Kuwait-ROK diplomatic relations were started in 1979, they have steadily improved specifically during the last two years, which witnessed a 30 percent improvement in business and trade," Lee said.

He added that two-way trade volume had reached 410 million US dollars per year, consisting mainly of the ROK's exports to Kuwait and oil exports from Kuwait to the ROK.

Talks between the two sides also focused on boosting bilateral relations as well as the latest regional and international developments, according to KUNA.

In addition, Kuwaiti Finance Minister Bader Al-Humaidhi called on the ROK investors to "discover the attractive investment opportunities in Kuwait."

He also recalled significant rise of Kuwaiti investments in the ROK, now standing at around 800 million dollars.

Earlier in the day, senior officials of Kuwait and the ROK signed an oil agreement and a final agreement on economic and technical cooperation.

Lee, who is currently on a three-day visit to Kuwait, was accompanied by a delegation representing some 40 key ROK companies.

The Korean premier is on a 12-day tour to five countries in the Gulf area, which has already brought him to the United Arab Emirates and will also bring him on to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman.
