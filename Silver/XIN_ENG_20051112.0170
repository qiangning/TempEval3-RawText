Southern Sudan's autonomous government vowed on Saturday that it would try all means to wipe out Ugandan rebel forces, the Lord Resistance Army (LRA), from the soil.

Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol made the statement at a press conference here, while talking about a recent visit to Washington by Salva Kiir Mayardit, Sudanese First-Vice President and President of the autonomous government in the south.

Akol noted that Kiir had discussed the LRA issue with the US administration and the two sides were identical on the issue.

The US administration did not show any proposals on the matter of the LRA, but it insisted that the problem should be solved quickly and the existence of the Ugandan rebels in the Sudanese lands is undesired as it is a foreign force that functions on the Sudanese territories and would bring damage to the country, said Akol.

Akol, meanwhile, pointed out that Kiir's US visit succeeded to convince the US administration to promise an exclusive decision to lift its economic sanctions it imposed on Sudan.

The US should deal only with the Sudanese national government and the sanctions imposed on Sudan could not be divided, he stressed.

On western Sudan's Darfur issue, Akol revealed that the Sudanese government delegation would head for the Nigerian capital Abuja on Nov. 20 to resume the peace talks with Darfur rebel groups, renewing the government's vows to shore up the crisis.

He said the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) led by Kiir and its main ruling partner in the national government, the National Congress, as well as other political parties would endeavor to crystallize the government's unified view for the next round of Abuja peace talks.
