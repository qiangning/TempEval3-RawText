Iraqi violence shadowed special early polling Monday ahead of a general election for a full-term parliament which many hope will stabilize the country and allow US troops to leave.

The vote is expected to restore full sovereignty to Iraq nearly three years after the invasion, with officials desperately hoping to draw Sunni Arabs back into the political process and undermine support for a crippling insurgency.

Before 15.5 million voters cast their ballots on Thursday, 300,000 Iraqi hospital patients, detainees and members of the security forces voted for the 275 deputies who are to serve four-year terms.

In an atmosphere of jubilation, Iraqi security forces punched the air and made V for victory signs as they queued outside polling stations in the capital.

Detainees in orange jumpsuits crossed their ballot papers in jails in the southern city of Samawa as electoral officials went from bed to bed with transparent ballot boxes in a Baghdad hospital, attending to patients too weak to walk.

Security measures, similar to those enforced at two earlier polls this year, will be imposed to limit bloodshed and bombings during Thursday's main event.

But violence flared in the capital before the clampdown took full effect, killing at least seven people and wounding at least 30.

Two US soldiers also died in separate attacks south of Baghdad and in the volatile western Sunni province of Al-Anbar.

Calling for a peaceful ballot, Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari vigorously defended his 10-month record in government at a Baghdad news conference.

"Praise be to God, Iraq is today stronger after overcoming so many obstacles," said the devout Shiite.

Rivals have accused him of presiding over a weak administration that has failed to quell violence and Jaafari could lose the top cabinet job in the political wrangling after the election.

But the dominant Shiite United Iraqi Alliance that includes Jaafari's Dawa Party put on a show of force by staging a rally that drew thousands in eastern Baghdad.

Red and green Shiite banners waved in Sadr City as militants chanted slogans in support of the UIA, which includes the Dawa Party, the powerful Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution and followers of radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

Across the country, airports and borders will shut from Wednesday, a five-day holiday imposed, curfews extended and weapons carrying banned.

Such strict security measures are intended to prevent the kind of suicide bombings that have become so commonplace in Iraq.

Al-Qaeda's branch in Iraq and four other extremist groups warned people not to vote in a statement posted on the Internet.

"What is known as the political process is nothing but a devilish plot," said a statement signed by the Al-Taifa Mansura Army.

The election for a 275-member parliament follows a lightning Anglo-US drive to oust Saddam in April 2003, two transitional governments and the adoption of a constitution in October.

Electoral officials will allow some candidates with suspected links to Saddam's former party to stand, but warned they could still be disqualified.

The committee responsible, however, for purging the state of Saddam loyalists called on voters not to elect roughly 130 Baathist candidates standing in the election among a total 7,000.

The body urged electors to reject such candidates "in the name of the victims of the mass graves and out of loyalty for the blood of the martyrs."

When the dust settles, the Iraqi parliament will set out to define a new direction for a country wracked by intercommunal tensions.

Strengthening democracy through credible elections is a cornerstone of US policy in the Middle East, which Washington hopes will foster the ultimate exit strategy from Iraq, an increasingly unpopular military campaign.

But success of the poll hinges on turnout among the fallen Sunni Arab elite that boycotted the January 30 election for a transitional parliament, Iraq's first free vote in half a century.

On Monday, Sunni Sheikh Khalaf al-Alyani, a leader of the Iraqi National Dialogue, pressed Iraqi insurgents to observe a five-day truce so that the crucial vote could take place peacefully.

The 228 political entities which have presented candidates number double the 111 groups that contested the January poll.
