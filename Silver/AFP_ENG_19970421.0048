The trial of the alleged plotters of a 1975 coup in which Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed was set to open Monday in a tightly guarded courthouse, officials said.

District and Session Judge Kazi Golam Rasul are hear witnesses to the killing of Sheikh Mujib, slain with most of his family in the August 15, 1975 putsch.

The case was reopened last year after the election victory of Rahman's daughter, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed, who led his Awami League party back to power last June for the first time since the coup.

Past laws granting amnesties to those accused of involvement in the coup have been repealed to allow the trial to go ahead.

Riot police were deployed around the court inside the Dhaka Central Jail ahead of the opening of the hearing. Only reporters and lawyers were allowed inside after a police security check.

Twenty people have been indicted in the case under Bangladesh's penal code, but only six will be present at the trial. Of those five are in jail and one out on bail, while the remaining 14 are still on the run.

The arrests were made soon after Sheikh Hasina's election victory last year.

Sheikh Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana were abroad at the time of the coup and are the only surviving members of the former first family.

Political analysts have said the coup was a conspiracy by a small group of army officials and a few right-leaning politicians.

They wanted to establish a rightist administration close to the Islamic world by overthrowing the secular and centrist Awami League government of Sheikh Mujib, analysts say.

In November 1996, parliament scrapped an indemnity act which until then had protected the alleged coup plotters from legal action. They had been given diplomatic assignments by successive governments to protect them abroad.
