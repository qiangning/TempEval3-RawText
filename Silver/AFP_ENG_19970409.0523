More than a thousand tonnes of crayfish have invaded Elands bay, some 200 kilometres (120 miles) north of Cape Town, since the weekend, the second invasion in three weeks.

Police have been forced to set up barriers and scoop up the crayfish with excavators to prevent people from collecting the highly-sought after shellfish.

The crayfish have been heading to the beaches to escape a toxic red tide -- a concentration of micro-organisms which depletes oxygen levels in the water.

Thousands of people have flocked to the coast to collect the crustacea. However South African legislation has strict fishing laws concerning the delicacy. Excepting those holding a special permit, the law limits fishermen to four crayfish per day during the fishing season.

Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn warned on Tuesday that people collecting crayfish without a permit or those caught in possession of more than four crayfish would be prosecuted, irrespective of whether the crayfish were dead or alive.

Residents in the surrounding areas have nevertheless asked permission to collect and sell the crayfish to raise funding to improve their communities.

Even though the environmental affairs and tourism ministry considered suspending the law, they said it would be "irresponsible to allow communities to access to untested crayfish which may not be fit for consumption."

Fishing authorities have called the red tide an ecological disaster.
