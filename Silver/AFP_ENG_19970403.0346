A planned trip by Turkish Defence Minister Turhan Tayan to Israel has been postponed to a later date as it coincides with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy's visit to Ankara, Turkish diplomats said Thursday.

According to a schedule announced last month, Tayan would visit Israel between April 7 and 9 and Levy would be in the Turkish capital on April 8 and 9.

"Tayan's visit will now be rescheduled for late April or early May," a foreign ministry official told AFP.

Turkey and Israel, whose relations remained dormant during decades of the Arab-Israeli conflict, boosted their ties to a strategic level last year.

They signed two major pacts on military and defence industry cooperation despite condemnation by radical Arab or Moslem states like Iran, Syria and Iraq.

In the largest-scale defence industry deal between the two countries, a 630 million agreement, under which a consortium led by Israel Aircraft Industries will upgrade Turkey's aging fleet of 54 F-4E Phantom aircraft, took effect last November.
