Iraq says it is close to agreement on upstream oil deals and their implementation with several foreign companies, thanks in part to a more favorable international atmosphere, an economic review published here reported Monday.

Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Rashid said his country has reached an understanding with interested oil companies on the plan for implementing the contracts, given the international sanctions against Iraq, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) reported.

The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions are to be lifted after verification that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.

The international political atmosphere is more positive toward Iraq and continues to change gradually in Baghdad's favor, Rashid told MEES by telephone from Rome.

The minister was in the Italian capital for talks with the Italian energy group ENI and its subsidiary Agip and said they are close to signing a 23-year agreement on the development of the Nasiriyah oil field in southern Iraq.

The field has a production capacity of about 300,000 barrels a day, and Agip would invest two billion dollars to develop it.

Rashid also held talks with senior political officials in Italy, where the Senate voted last week in favor of a gradual lifting of UN sanctions against Iraq.
