An inquiry into illegal payments in English football is to target 17 transfers that need further investigation, Former Metropolitan Police commissioner Lord Stevens confirmed Wednesday.

Lord Stevens, who was investigating a total of 362 transfers, did not give details of the questionable deals as he delivered his "observations and recommendations" into alleged so-called bungs after a nine-month inquiry on Wednesday.

But he revealed that certain elements had been passed on to the police.

Lord Stevens revealed that "eight major agents" had not co-operated but he refused to identify the people involved.

As a result, his Quest team have been asked to look into a specific number of deals which took place between January 1 2004 and January 31 2006, under a new mandate.

"This is no witch hunt. This is no whitewash," Lord Stevens told a news conference.

"The reason why we are not naming names is the inquiry is ongoing. I know you would like us to name and shame but I can't do it at the present stage.

"The game, in relation to the majority of what we have seen, is clean but the accounting processes and monitoring of the clubs is in a mess."

Lord Stevens stressed all of his 38 recommendations must be adopted to safeguard the integrity of the game.

These include the creation of a body to handle the audit of transfers rather than the Football Association (FA).

"Every one of these recommendations must be implemented as they are essential to the future and reputation of this game," he said.

"Failure to do so will result in the game remaining under attack and its remaining members subject to allegations and innuendo.

"The FA and the compliance unit does not have the credibility of the public or the clubs," Lord Stevens said.

"The proposed regulation and compliance unit must be established with expertise and independence to take on this work.

"Part of the FA's problems has been the lack of forensic investigators and accountants. The work must be preventative."

Lord Stevens criticised the lack of assistance he had received from some agents during the course of his team's investigation.

"Agents failure to respond has resulted in delays to this inquiry," he said.

"We will be providing the Premier League with a number of incidences where mandated processes have not been followed.

"The frequency of these instances show the clubs neither anticipate nor are concerned by the strictures imposed by the FA.

"It is my view this further erodes the reputation of the game and those involved in it.

"Such scant disregard for the rules and regulations of this great game is unacceptable."

Lord Stevens called on cooperation from the FA and world football's governing body FIFA.

"It is very important indeed we have the co-operation of FIFA," he said.

"It is a changing time for football and it is about time. The health of the game depends on it."
