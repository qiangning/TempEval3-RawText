Norway's role in Sri Lanka has come under fire during the nation's election campaign, Norwegian Broadcasting reported on Friday (NRK).

Norway is both facilitating the peace talks between Colombo and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as well as leading the international observer force in Sri Lanka.

"It is unfortunate that Norway is both mediating between the two sides in the civil war, and at the same time heading the observer force which is supposed to criticize those who break the ceasefire," a spokesman for the Sri Lanka Democracy Forum said to NRK.

"Norway will consider withdrawing from the leadership of the international observer force," said Norway's International Development Minister Erik Solheim.

He underlined, however, that such a move must be taken in close cooperation with the two sides in the conflict.
