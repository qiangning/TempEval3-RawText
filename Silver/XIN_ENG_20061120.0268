The United States said on Monday that Syria should become "a positive actor" in Iraq and take actions necessary to help improve the situation in Iraq.

"What we would like to see the Syrians do is to take steps to become a positive actor in Iraq and not to do things that would foment violence or that would help support violence there," State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said at a briefing.

"And I think the most important thing for the Syrian government is to look to themselves and take the actions that are necessary to help improve the situation in Iraq," Casey said.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who is paying a landmark visit to Iraq, has called for the withdrawal of foreign troops out of Iraq to end the violence in the country.

However, the United States has accused Syria of allowing terrorists to go into Iraq to fight against the U.S.-led coalition troops in the country.

The U.S. military has alleged that up to 100 foreign fighters cross into Iraq from Syria every month.
