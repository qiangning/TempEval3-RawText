India's stock markets will remain cautious next week, when the country's 10-month coalition government is to face a crucial confidence vote in parliament, analysts said Saturday.

On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India's oldest and largest, the barometer 30-share sensitive index shed 113.16 points or three percent during a week of sharp swings, to close on Friday at 3,550.37 points.

The broadbased 100-share national index was down by 45.22 points or 2.85 percent and closed at 1,539.75 points.

India was thrown into a political crisis March 30 when the Congress (I) party withdrew its parliamentary support to the United Front government led by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.

Hit by the unexpected development, panicky Indian stock market speculators sold heavily the next day, pulling the BSE sensex down by more than eight percent in a single day.

Prices recovered moderately during the week as domestic and foreign institutional investors bought at low, attractive price levels.

Analysts and stock brokers said trading sentiment would be cautious when the market opens Monday.

"Everybody will be waiting for the confidence vote on Friday. The political situation is the key sentiment for the markets now," said stock broker Ajit Ambani.

Ambani said no fresh buying support was expected. "I do not expect any big jump or fall in prices next week. Prices are likely to be at current levels," he said.

Average daily business volumes were up to 190 million dollars from 171 million dollars the previous week.
