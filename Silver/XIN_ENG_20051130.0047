The delegation of Shenzhou-6 manned space mission arrived in Macao Wednesday for a three-day visit and academic exchange at the invitation of Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR).

The 30-strong delegation, including taikonauts Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng, disembarked the ferry jetboat at the Macao Ferry Terminal at noon.

A large crowd waving China's miniature national flags and MSAR flags welcomed the space heroes.

The taikonauts smiled, accepted bouquets, shook hands with fans and signed autographs.

The delegation was greeted by Wang Jinxiang, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the MSAR and Ao Man Long, secretary for transportation and public works.

During its stay, the delegation is to meet local students, give lectures and attend a grand evening gala hosted by the MSAR government.

Fei Junlong, 40, and Nie Haisheng, 41, went into space on Oct. 12 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center and returned to Earth on Oct. 17. They conducted a series of unprecedented experiments on the spacecraft.

China's maiden space flight in 2003, conducted by taikonaut Yang Liwei, made the nation the third to put human into space following Russia and the United States.
