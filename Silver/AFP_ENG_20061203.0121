In China, the case of a 71-year-old homeless man who committed arson to get a place to live -- jail -- has highlighted the plight of millions of desperately poor elderly, state media said Sunday.

Li Zhaokun was detained in November after starting a forest fire on a mountainside in south China's Guangdong province, the Xinhua news agency reported.

Investigators were startled to find that he had only just completed a five-year term for arson, but wanted to return to prison, which at least promised food and shelter, according to Xinhua.

He had attempted suicide twice, but each time he was saved and told to seek help in his home town.

But Li, who had moved from place to place as a child and lost his parents before he was 10, had one problem: "I don't know where I'm from."

Li's case may be extreme, but it reflects growing social pressures in China, as the number of elderly without family networks explodes.

China's modernization is partly to blame, because old customs like the obligation to venerate and care for the elderly are breaking down.

But economic factors are also at work, as millions of young farmers move to the cities in hopes of finding jobs, leaving their parents behind, many with little financial support.

A recent survey covering 10,400 peasants over the age of 60 in 31 provinces showed 45 percent were not living with their children and five percent did not know where their next meal would come from, according to Xinhua.

Sixty-nine percent had just one set of clothes and 67 percent could not afford medicine.

Young farmers were also surveyed, and at least half did not care about their parents' situation, said Zhai Yuhe, a coal mine owner from northeast China's Heilongjiang province, who financed the survey.

"I know a man in his 90s. His six children collectively give him 30 to 50 yuan (3.8 to 6.3 dollars) a month," Zhai told Xinhua.

"But no one offers to accept him in their home. No one would be there to help him if he had an accident or fell ill."

Some elderly are under so much strain that they seek court action to force their children to provide help.

In Beijing, more than 2,000 rural parents sued their children for support last year, according to the city's Intermediate People's Court, Xinhua reported.
