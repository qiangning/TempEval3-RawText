South Korean stocks are expected to fare well in the near term after rising 3.0 percent over the past week amid expectations that an economic downturn has bottomed out, brokers said.

"We are likely to see a strong market for this month," providing there are no unexpected outside developments, said a broker at Shinyoung Securities here on the last trading day Friday.

The Korea Stock Exchange's composite index rose 20.23 points to 687.42 points over the week before closing for a holiday Saturday.

Shares rallied 1.5 percent Monday after the government announced plans to bolster the economy and stabilize financial markets,.

Dismal trade figures led to a 0.6 percent decline Tuesday but foreign investors helped the market index climb 0.9 percent the following day as they awaited an increase in the foreign shareholding limit on May 1.

The market eased marginally Thursday amid rumours about a probe into price rigging of selected stocks but it rebounded 1.3 percent Friday as investors hunted for bargains among petrochemical and steel shares, brokers said.

Over week, shares in Pohang Iron and Steel rallied 5,500 won (62 US cents) to 52,300 won (5.88 dollars) and Samsung Electronics rose 2,800 won to 62,000 won.
