Britain welcomed Friday a vote to support a new constitution for Gibraltar, modernizing ties between the British dependent territory and London and allowing greater local autonomy.

"I warmly welcome the people of Gibraltar's decision to accept the draft Gibraltar constitution," said Europe Minister Geoff Hoon, after the referendum on the "Rock" on Thursday.

"I look forward to working with the government of Gibraltar in the new, more modern and mature UK-Gibraltar relationship that it entails," he added in a statement.

The electorate of the tiny outcrop on Spain's south coast, population just 27,000, were called to back a greater degree of self-determination after seven years of negotiations aimed at modernizing ties between Gibraltar and Britain.

A clear majority, 60.2 percent, of voters backed the question: "In exercise of your right to self-determination, do you approve and accept the proposed new Constitution for Gibraltar?"

However, turnout was modest at around 60 percent -- 28 percentage points less than in a 2002 referendum where residents overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that Spain and Britain should share sovereignty over Gibraltar.
