A state-owned Chinese company diverted US equipment intended for civilian purposes to a weapons plant but has returned the materiel on US orders, the White House said Wednesday.

Spokesman Michael McCurry said the United States discovered that the machines were moved to an "unapproved" location by the Chinese, after the New York Times reported the equipment was sent to a missile and fighter jet plant.

He declined to elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation, but said "the machines in question are now under the supervision of the original customer -- they're back at a McDonnell Douglas facility."

A year-long investigation using satellite photos suggested that in 1994 CATIC, a state-owned corporation, diverted McDonnell Douglas Corp. equipment designed to build civilian jetliners to a military complex of the Nanchang Aircraft Co, according to the Times.

Pentagon officials earlier feared that the equipment, which includes giant tools used to shape and bend large aircraft parts, could be used for military purposes.

US officials believe that the Chinese intended to use the equipment for military purposes all along. The matter is under criminal investigation.
