Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd., two of Japan's Big Four stockbrokers, announced Friday net losses for the year to March, joining market leader Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. which disclosed its own net loss of 243 billion yen (two billion dollars) on Thursday.

Daiwa, the country's second-largest broker, said it suffered a net parent company loss of 84.0 billion yen, reversing a net profit of 43.7 billion yen a year earlier. Pre-tax earnings fell 29.2 percent to 44.3 billion yen while operating income fell 3.3 percent to 291.8 billion yen.

Nikko, ranked third, announced a net consolidated loss of 116.7 billion yen, reversing a net profit of 38 billion yen with pre-tax earnings plunging 60 percent from a year earlier to 28.5 billion yen. Group operating income was up 17 percent at 461.1 billion yen.

Following a similar move by NoMura on Thursday, neither company offered profit forecasts for the current year although Daiwa vice president Hiromitsu Sogame said his company's projection was for higher earnings than the year just ended. But he declined to give figures.

Daiwa blamed its poor result on "large losses amid a slack stock market" along with cutbacks in bond-trading activity.

During the year, the company suffered an extraordinary loss of 120 billion yen on the bailout of troubled affiliate Daiwa Finance Co. Ltd., a Tokyo-based company in which the securities firm had a five percent stake.

Sogame said costs were expected to rise further this year due to upgrading ahead of the planned "Big Bang" for the Tokyo financial market, modelled on British deregulatory reforms a decade ago and expected to be in place by 2001.

"We will renew our bond trading room and build a personal computer network and proceed with global risk management projects," he said.

Referring to a recent scandal involving illegal trading by Nomura, Sogame said Daiwa was seeking to set up an operations administration department to strengthen internal supervision. "So far, we have not received a report that illegal trading and transactions have been found," he said.

Asked about trading by individual investors, he said: "I do not expect individual investors to stay away from the market because of Nomura's illegal transactions ... I hope the share will rise, as it has been at a low level."

Nikko vice president Masao Yuki said his company had not detected any incoming transfer of funds from Nomura following the scandal.

Asked whether Nikko had conducted internal investigations, he said: "It is natural to conduct internal investigations, and if any problem emerges, we will disclose it. But we cannot disclose details of client trading."

Nikko said extraordinary losses during the latest year came to 147.5 billion yen, reflecting assistance to three companies within the group.

Yuki said earnings were pressured by declining profits at subsidiaries in Europe, the United States and Asia in the year to March although banking units in the United States and Luxembourg booked firm profits.

"Rising personnel costs such as hiring talented traders ... are pressuring earnings," he added.

Refering to Nikko's lower market share on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Yuji said: "I think the weight of foreign securities has been rising."

Nikko's share of trading on the exchange fell from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent by volume and from 8.5 percent to 8.0 percent by value.
