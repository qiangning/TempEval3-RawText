David Cameron faces his first test Wednesday as Britain's new opposition leader at the weekly prime minister's questions in parliament -- a battle of wits with Tony Blair over burning political issues.

Fresh from his decisive victory Tuesday as Conservative Party leader, the telegenic, eloquent and youthful Cameron will fire the opening shots in a revitalized campaign aimed at returning his party to power.

And newspaper pundits say Cameron -- the fifth Conservative leader to face Blair -- has raised hopes he will produce the first credible opposition to Blair's Labour Party since it swept into Downing Street in 1997.

At 39, he promises to be the upstart that Blair was when he became Labour leader in 1994 at about the same age. Cameron was a virtual unknown six months ago and has spent only four years in parliament.

The first test for Cameron comes at 1200 GMT in parliament when Blair, 51, stands before the House of Commons to answer questions from MPs about a range of topics, including the economy, crime, education, health and foreign policy.

He takes over from the older and more experienced Michael Howard, a former interior minister, at an event which is usually a rowdy, knockabout half-hour in which withering wit is used to stir cheers and jeers in the chamber.

Cameron, who has shown his cool in tough television interviews, has vowed not to play the politics of "Punch and Judy," two British puppet characters who engage in tit-for-tat taunts, but pundits doubt he can stay above the fray.

"What he's got to do (Wednesday) is survive and it will be nerve-wracking," according to Gyles Brandreth, who as a Conservative government whip in the 1990s saw prominent colleagues tremble during the event.

Brandreth told BBC's Newsnight program it will be "very difficult when you're actually performing inside the Punch and Judy tent" to avoid the adversarial dynamic.

Among other upcoming challenges will be naming his shadow cabinet, his team of spokespeople to scrutinize government ministers. He has already promoted Patrick McLoughlin from deputy to chief whip, the main enforcer of party discipline.

But the job Cameron offers to current interior affairs spokesman David Davis, who lost the party leadership runoff on Tuesday, could be crucial to party unity.

Bitter internal splits helped bring about the Conservatives' downfall in 1997 after 18 years in office.

It was the party that had dominated British government during the 20th century under such political titans as former PMs Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.

And battered by three successive election defeats in eight years at the hands of Blair's Labour Party, the Conservatives are hoping Cameron's prescription of compassion and tolerance can revive their fortunes.

The trick will be to keep the party from drifting to the right and move it to the center, just as Blair managed to shift Labour from the left to the middle, pundits say.

The new Conservative leader may have to wait until May 2010 for a general election, when he would likely face Blair's finance minister and heir apparent Gordon Brown.

"It is going to be a huge challenge. We have a vast mountain to climb," Cameron admitted.

He pledged to change the fact that nine out of 10 Conservative MPs are white men and tackle the "scandalous" under-representation of women in the party.

The left-leaning Independent newspaper, which has taken Blair to task over the war in Iraq and its anti-terrorism policies, ran an editorial on Cameron under the headline: "A mandate for change that must not be squandered.

"Britain has been without a serious party of opposition for the best part of a decade now. David Cameron's election as Tory leader gives us hope that we may, finally, get one back," it said.
