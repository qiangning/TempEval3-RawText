The Los Angeles Clippers and coach Mike Dunleavy have reached a four-year contract extension worth more than 21 million U.S. dollars, according to the Los Angeles Times Tuesday.

The team and Dunleavy's agent have worked out a deal that will pay him more than 5.3 million U.S. doallars a season. The Clippers have not made the deal public because bonuses tied to future playoff appearances were still being worked out, the Times said.

The Clippers improved dramatically under Dunleavy last season, posting their best win total since the franchise's glory days as the Buffalo Braves in the mid-1970s. The team reached the playoffs for the first time in nine seasons and came within one win of reaching the Western Conference final.

The Times reported the offer is close to the 6 million U.S. a year Dunleavy's agent initially proposed and would make him among the highest-paid coaches in the NBA.

Dunleavy, the NBA's 1999 coach of the year, currently earns 2.5 million U.S. dollars a season, and his deal expires at the end of this season.
