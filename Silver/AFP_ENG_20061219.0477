Kenyan athletics officials Tuesday allayed fears by foreign athletes over the risk of contracting malaria during next year's World cross country championships in Mombasa.

Britian's former European title holder Jon Brown said he had cancelled plans to run in the March 24 championships because the Kenyan venue is located in a region prone to malaria outbreaks.

But Athletics Kenya (AK) spokesman Peter Angwenyi said precautions had been taken to ensure the hotels where the athletes will be sleeping were free from malaria-carrying parasites.

"There is no cause of alarm," said Angwenyi told AFP. "Our medical authorities are working in conjunction with the IAAF medical commission to ensure the health of all the competitors will be safeguarded. This includes making sure that Mombasa is a complete malaria-free zone," he added.

"Mombasa is a top tourist destination. We cannot accept to take the athletes to a place where their health will be at a risk. In fact the month of March is a very hot season when there are no mosquitoes," he said.

Malaria is one of the country's top killer diseases.
