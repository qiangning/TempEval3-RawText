The warning for a tsunami up to 50 centimeters high was issued for the Pacific side of the Hokkaido and Tohoku areas in northern and northeastern Japan.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the quake.

The focus was at a shallow depth under the seabed in the Pacific some 310 kilometers east of the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture.
