Cyprus here Monday denied any responsibility for a possible failure to Finland's initiative on Ankara-Nicosia ties in order to avert any possible derailment of Turkey's EU accession course.

Cyprus government spokesman Christodoulos Pashiardis told the press that the failure will be an unpleasant development which the Republic of Cyprus would not be responsible for in the least and the responsibility cannot be allocated to all involved to provide a sense of balance.

Finland, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has been working on a draft proposal, providing for opening of Turkish occupied port of Famagusta (Varosha) under the EU administration for 24 months in combination with the opening of Turkish ports to ships carrying the Cypriot flag and the transfer of Famagusta to the UN.

For the purpose, The EU presidency had prepared the ground for a possible meeting in Helsinki between Cyprus and Turkey before cancelling the consultations on Nov. 2, following Ankara's refusal to meet its EU obligations and Cyprus' position that Turkey must do exactly that before EU accession negotiations are allowed to move further on.

But Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, meanwhile, promised that "efforts to find a solution that will enable the uninterrupted continuation of Turkey's accession negotiations and improve the situation of both communities in Cyprus will continue. "

Pashiardis said that "we don't know at the moment of any change of the presidency's original ideas. However, it is aware of our firm position on Varosha, which is a precondition for the successful outcome of the Finnish presidency initiative."

"Our side is demanding something which is logical and rejects the irrational. The Turkish side is demanding irrational things and rejects the logical," he added.

Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily intervened and occupied the north of Cyprus following a coup by a group of Greek officers.

Turkey, a country aspiring to become an EU member state, does not recognize the Republic of Cyprus and has failed so far to implement the EU-Turkey Customs Union Protocol, which provides for opening of its ports and airports to Cyprus.

The EU formally launched talks with Turkey over the country's accession last October. The negotiations are expected to last at least a decade and Ankara is required to meet a number of criteria spelled out by the EU before entry.

The Republic of Cyprus, which entered the EU on behalf of the whole island in May 2004, is able to block Turkey's entry talks with its veto.
