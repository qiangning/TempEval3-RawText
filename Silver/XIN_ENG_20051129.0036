Zambia's sugar exports will be dealt a heavy blow by the European Union's decision to lower the prices of commodities such as sugar, industry insiders have said.

Lovemore Sievu, Zambia Sugar corporate affairs manager, was cited by Tuesday's The Post as saying the planned move by the EU which is expected take effect next year would likely reduce the company's export receipts by as much as 40 percent.

Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa also complained during the just-ended Commonwealth summit in the Mediterranean island country Malta that price reduction would translate into reducing the standard of living for the people in countries like Zambia which are main providers of such commodities.

Sievu said the company was also affected by the constant appreciation of the local currency kwacha against the US dollar, of which the devaluation entails that the value of each unit of sugar exported is lower when converted into kwacha.

Trade Network of Zambia coordinator Stephen Muyakwa said the recent announcement by the EU would be disadvantageous to producers in countries such as Zambia.

He said it would be very unfair especially for small-scale farmers who were selling their produce to companies like Zambia Sugar.

Muyakwa thus urged the EU to come up measures to cushion the effects of the reduction so as to enable those affected countries to become more efficient in the production of sugar and other commodities.

"We also need support to enable us develop capacity to diversify to other commodities such as beef so that we can compete favorably on the market," Muyakwa was quoted as saying.

During the summit, President Mwanawasa also called upon the EU to remove subsidies on agricultural commodities in favor of developing countries like Zambia.
