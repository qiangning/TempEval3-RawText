French energy groups Gad de France and Suez won European Union conditional approval on Tuesday for their merger, which would create Europe's second-largest utility and maintain national control of the French power market.

The deal would result in a group with a combined market capitalization of nearly 80 billion euros (102.6 billion dollars), putting the new entity behind EDF of France but ahead of E.ON, the German energy giant.

Suez and GDF got the go-ahead after they agreed to give up control of Belgian natural gas companies and a heating network in France, the European Commission said in Strasbourg, France.

"Our intervention in this case is part of our action to ensure that there is effective competition in the newly-liberalized energy markets to the benefit of consumers and business," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

France brokered the merger in February to prevent a bid for Suez by Enel of Italy, prompting criticism that it was breaking EU free-market rules by shutting the energy market to outsiders.

Inside France, the government has struggled to push the merger because it requires reducing the state's stake in GDF, - a move opposed by unions and socialist politicians who promised to make the deal an issue in next year's presidential election.

A law allowing the French government to cut its stake in the company from 70 percent to one-third, ahead of the merger, was formally passed by parliament last week.
