Goal-shy CSKA Moscow's Champions League fate is out of their hands as they head into Wednesday's group G match against SV Hamburg.

CSKA, who have scored just two goals in their five games, are two points behind Arsenal and FC Porto, who defeated them 2-0 in their last match, and the 2005 UEFA Cup champions must defeat German side Hamburg to have any chance of reaching the last 16.

If CSKA win and there is a winner in the Arsenal and Porto match the Russians will progress but a draw in the other match in Portugal will see them eliminated.

For 1983 European champions Hamburg pride is at stake after five straight defeats in Europe's flagship competition.

Hamburg are in this competition for the first time since 2001 after finishing third in the Bundesliga last season but it has been an immediately forgettable campaign.

Along with Levski Sofia, the Germans, second from bottom of the Bundesliga, are the only team yet to register a point in this season's Champions League.

"We know it has been a disappointing season but all we can do is try to make things better from now on," said Hamburg coach Thomas Doll.

"My future has been talked about for the past few weeks so I do not think I need to add anything else."

If Hamburg, who have won just once in 15 league matches, fail to get even a draw against CSKA they will become only the seventh team in Champions League history to end up without a point in the group stage.
