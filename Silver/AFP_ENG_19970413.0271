The first French soldiers of an international force in Albania disembarked here at dawn Sunday and met up with an advanced Italian unit, while the main body of troops for "Operation Alba" is due to arrive in the week ahead.

A 40-strong team from several special forces units came ashore from the troop transport ship Champlain, which had sailed from the Italian port of Brindisi. A further 80 troops remained aboard in reserve.

About 20 four-wheel-drive vehicles were unloaded onto the dilapidated quayside of Albania's main port, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the capital Tirana.

Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Marc Lebout, who is in charge of the French operation, said he had been greeted by several officials from the Albanian defence ministry.

"We don't feel in a hostile environment," Lebout said.

"It's a humanitarian mission. We're here to prepare the ground for our colleagues' arrival," he said.

Two hours after the French landed, an Italian military vehicle drove up to the port to make contact.

"The situation is very calm here. The population is very self- disciplined, they want tranquility," said Lieutenant Colonel Michele Tunzi, of an Italian paratroop unit.

The advanced Italian units landed on Albanian soil on Friday, about 20 arriving by sea and the same number flying in to Tirana airport.

Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi told a press conference here held along with his Albanian counterpart Bashkim Fino that Operation Alba would end one month after elections are held sometime before the end of June.

Prodi said: "Our aim is to leave as soon as we have helped reconstruct the state, that is one month after the democratic elections we are asking for."

He confirmed that most of the troops in the operation were to arrive on Tuesday.

Prodi also visited the port of Vlore in the south, where the Albanian insurrection began. From the balcony of the local government offices he called for a minute's silence for the four dead and 83 missing from a refugee boat that sank after colliding with an Italian warship on March 28.

"Alba (Italian for dawn) is not just the start of a new day, but also that of the new Albania," he said to applause. "Next week we will all be busy working together for the rebirth of Albania."

A spokesman for the French army information service said the advance party was made up of highly-mobile troops whose task was to prepare for the arrival of the troop ship Orage, due here Tuesday with 450 marines on board.

"There is no question of giving in to the slightest threat or the least blackmail," spokesman Major Herve Gourmelon said.

"It would be more stupidity than hostility if a group attacked the force," he added.

France is expected to provide up to 1,000 troops to the UN-approved multinational force in Albania.

Their principal task will be to secure the port and the road linking it to Tirana.

The mission, which will total around 6,000 troops, is intended to facilitate aid shipments to the most vulnerable sections of the population.

The biggest contributor will be Italy with around 2,500 men.

Italy which occupied Albania between April 1939 and the end of World War II declaring its king, Victor Emmanuel III, king of Albania, has traditionally close ties with its neighbor, only 70 kilometers (45 miles) across the Adriatic Sea.

Although the force is only mandated to secure aid channels, Lieutenant Colonel Thimi Hudhra -- one of the Albanian military staff sent to meet the French troops -- said he was counting on the troops of Operation Alba to restore order in his country.

"We have already got together three or four units totalling 2,500 men in Tirana to work with the international force," he said.

The force is not going to start disarming civilians who seized weapons during the Albanian insurgency however.

Despite the apparent absence of hostility in Durres and the north, question marks remain over the reception the force will get in the south, much of which is in rebel hands.

Greece, Italy and Romania are expected to deploy troops to the south, while Spanish troops will be sent to the north and the French will remain in Durres and Tirana.

In Greece's northern city of Salonika, General Manoussos Preveroudakis, commander-in-chief of the Greek army, said the Greek contingent was ready after inspecting the troops.

He said that "all the instructions have been given" to the force of about 680 men who will be deployed in Tirana and Vlore.

Greek Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said the soldiers would travel to Tirana in a C-130 transport plane.

An authoritative Greek source said most of the contingent, made up entirely of career soldiers, would leave on Wednesday.

Other contingents will be supplied by Austria, Denmark and Turkey, but it is not yet clear where they will be posted.
