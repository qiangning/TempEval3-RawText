UN envoy James Baker launches a fresh initiative on Western Sahara beginning Tuesday, in a bid to revive plans for a long-delayed political settlement for the disputed mineral-rich territory.

Baker, who was named the personal envoy of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for Western Sahara last month, made few predictions on what he hoped to achieve before his departure.

During a visit here for consultations earlier this month, the former US secretary of state said it was premature to envisage changes to a UN peace plan providing for a referendum on the future of the territory claimed by both Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.

The UN-proposed referendum would determine whether Western Sahara should become part of Morocco or an independent state.

With a UN-monitored ceasefire holding since 1991, a resolution to the conflict which has festered for 22 years since Spain's withdrawal from the territory has been put on the international community's back burner for the past year.

During his mission, the 66-year-old Texan diplomat will hold talks with Moroccan and Polisario Front leaders and meet with officials in Algiers and in Nouakchott, the capital of neighboring Mauritania.

UN spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said Baker would make "a fresh assessment of the situation" during his mission, expected to last until the end of the month.

Western diplomats here said Monday that Baker could assess the chances of a resumption of direct talks between the Polisario Front and Morocco, which could move forward the peace process.

However Morocco publicly insists that developments must take place within the framework of the UN peace plan.

UN plans for the identification of voters in the referendum have been on hold for the past 12 months amid disagreements over who would be entitled to take part.

Polisario stands by the 1974 census carried out by Spain, the former colonial ruler, fixing the number of Western Sahara voters at around 74,000. But Morocco wants to add tens of thousands of others who according to Moroccan officials fled the Spanish colony to seek refuge in Morocco.

"If there could be a resolution of this problem, there could be not just economic benefits for the region and for the parties, involved but political benefits as well," says Baker.
