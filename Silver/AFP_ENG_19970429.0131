Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is claiming that it is ancestral spirits -- not Ugandan soldiers -- who are aiding south Sudanese rebels fighting the military regime in Khartoum.

Museveni, not a man known for strong religious or superstitious beliefs, told parliamentarians Monday that the spirits had been invoked by Ugandan prayers.

Tongue firmly in cheek, he went on: "I don't want to go into details, because if you expose them, they may be unhappy. Once the spirit prays, practical help comes from other sources."

Spirits seem to be at work in the army, too.

Museveni said hundreds of "ghosts" were drawing army pay and food allowances, costing the barracks in the northern town of Gulu 40,000 dollars a month.

Meanwhile, local newspapers reported that the Ugandan army has paraded 114 Sudanese prisoners in war before a crowd at a stadium of 3,000 in Gulu on Monday.

The military said the Sudanese prisoners were captured while fighting alongside Lord's Resistance Army rebels in northern Uganda.

Sudan accuses Uganda of backing rebels who hav been fighting Khartoum since 1983.
