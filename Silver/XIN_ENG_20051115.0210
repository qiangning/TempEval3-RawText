The retail sales in the United States declined by 0.1 percent in October mainly because of the falling gasoline prices and the drop of car sales, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday.

The slight decline of overall US sales was significantly better than the 0.7 percent drop many economists had expected.

The report showed that the decline was led by a big 3.6 percent drop in auto sales, which have weakened with the removal of attractive discounts automakers had used during the summer.

Also working to hold back the US retail sales in October was a 0.8 percent decline in sales at gasoline stations, a drop that reflected a big retreat in pump prices.

However, excluding auto sale, US retail sales rose by a solid 0.9 percent last month as a result of big gains at specialty clothing stores and department stores, lifting the outlook for the upcoming holiday sales season.

Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for two-thirds of total US economic activity and retail sales account for about an half of the consumer spending in the country.
