Russia is unable to influence the process of NATO enlargement, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said on Tuesday.

Ivanov's remarks came as leaders from 26 NATO member countries were meeting in Riga, Latvia, for a summit focused on its mission in Afghanistan and its future role. U.S. President George W. Bush said on Tuesday the transatlantic military alliance's door remains open to European countries.

"We can take a critical posture and say we disapprove of this or that country's admission to NATO, but I believe it would be very wrong," Ivanov was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as telling students at St. Petersburg State University.

"Each country is free to decide what bloc it should be a member of," Ivanov said. "We have no intention of joining NATO," he added.

NATO has recognized Albania, Croatia and Macedonia as formal aspirant countries. Georgia and Ukraine also have intentions to join, but are in an earlier stage of the process. The three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- joined the alliance in 2004.
