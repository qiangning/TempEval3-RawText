U.S. President George W. Bush said Wednesday that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was stepping down, one day after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.

Bush made the announcement during a press conference at the White House.

Former CIA Director Robert Gates would succeed Rumsfeld, he said.
