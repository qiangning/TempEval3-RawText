The US government has given Nepal 30 million dollars for a range of projects including agriculture, forestry development and health, the US Information Service (USIS) said Friday.

The USIS said a grant of 25 million dollars would be used for expanding the participation of farmers, traders and agro-enterprises in high-value crop markets, the sustainable management of the productive resource base and privatization of state-owned agricultural and forest based enterprises.

The agreement, which was signed by the two governments Thursday, "demonstrates USAID/Nepal's continuing commitment to development activities in agriculture and forestry," it said in a press release.

"These two sectors provide income and employment opportunities for almost 80 percent of Nepal's population," it added.

A further grant of five million dollars will be provided as part of incremental funding to reduce fertility and improve maternal and child health, it said.

"Funds are being provided in support of a 35 million dollar nationwide programme which will increase the availability, quality and use of voluntary family planning reproductive health services; help control diarrhoeal diseases, acute respiratory infections and vitamin A deficiency in children," it said.

"The programme will also reduce maternal mortality, reduce transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDS," it said.

"The assistance is expectd to result in a reduction in the total fertility rate from 4.5 in 1996 to 4.0 by 2002, and a reduction in the under five child mortality rate, from 118 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1996 to 85 by the year 2002," it said.
