Muslims in Europe face discrimination in education, employment and housing and are often victims of verbal abuse and physical attacks, a monitoring group reported Monday.

"The report makes it clear that Muslims... frequently suffer different forms of discrimination which reduce their employment opportunities, and affect their educational achievement," the director of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) said in a statement.

The "Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia" report, published on Monday, said incidents against Muslims were "under-documented and under-reported" and called on European Union countries to improve their methods for reporting racist crimes.
