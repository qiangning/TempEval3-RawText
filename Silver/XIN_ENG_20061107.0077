The local authority of Uganda's capital city of Kampala has decided to release 7,000 U.S. dollars every week to seal potholes in the city centre.

The acting town clerk of Kampala City Council (KCC) Ruth Kijjambu was quoted by New Vision on Tuesday as saying the KCC engineering department would carry out the works "as long as funds are available."

She said major roads like Jinja Road, which have gigantic potholes, would be considered first.

"We have decided to have a weekly monitoring of potholes to avoid their accumulation and enlargement," Kijjambu said. KCC budgeted over 1 million dollar to repair its broken-down roads.

Last week, KCC started sealing the pothole at Old Port Bell Road, which recently felled at least three heavy trucks in one week.

Meanwhile, Kampala mayor Nasser Sebaggala said negotiations were going on with the Chinese government to supply KCC with road construction equipment worth 10 million dollars through a long- term loan.

Sebaggala said the city council expects 35 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank, part of which would be used on road repairs.

He said the central government also promised to repair some of the roads in preparations for the Commonwealth summit in November next year.

"If we succeed with the funding, we hope we shall not fail to do away with the potholes, and improve on the traffic flow," he said.

Due to lack of financial support in maintenance and repair, most of the major roads in and outside of Kampala city were damaged with potholes, which considerably constrained the traffic flow in the country.
