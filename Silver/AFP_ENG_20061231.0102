Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo was named by leading Portuguese sports daily A Bola on Sunday as the country's sportsman of the year.

A Bola chose the player for his "important contribution to the expansion of Portuguese football across the world".

The 21-year-old international finished ahead of Benfica striker Nuno Gomes, the winner of the award last year, and Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho, who won in 2004.

"I'm very happy with what I've managed to succeed up until now," Ronaldo told A Bola after scoring two goals in Manchester United's 3-2 win over Reading in the English Premiership on Saturday.

"I've scored foals and helped my team win. I want to continue at this level in 2007."
