Vanuatu's President Jean-Marie Leye has declared Saturday a public holiday to celebrate the ordination of the first indigenous Roman Catholic bishop here, the State House said Friday.

Michel Visi, 42, the first Melanesian bishop in this southwestern Pacific island state's history, was appointed last December by Pope John Paul II.

Visi, from Ambae island, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of here, takes over from American Francis Lambert who at 75 must retire.

The new Vanuatu bishop, who studied in seminaries in neighbouring New Caledonia and at Fiji's Pacific Regional Seminary, where he was rector, obtained a canon law degree in Canada.

He will now be in charge of a diocese, with 14 priests, covering the 80 scattered islands in this Y-shaped archipelago. He is the first indigenous bishop since Vanuatu's catholic mission arrived here more than 110 years ago.

"I prepared myself, especially I made a 30-day retreat in Australia with the Jesuits. I think the mission of a bishop requires a lot of tranquility in heart and mind," Visi told AFP on the eve of the historic event.

More than 1,000 people are converging on the capital from outlying islands and more than 200 visitors, including the Wellington-based nuncio Archbishop Thomas White, are journeying from overseas.

The two-day celebrations, which are to start Saturday with the official ordination, are set in Port Vila's largest open ground, the Independence Park.

Vanuatu's linguistic and religious legacy is strongly related to the presence of missionaries who early last century were among the first permanent white settlers in these islands.

The nation, with its 170,000 inhabitants on some 80 inhabited islands, defines itself in its constitution as a Christian country.

Churches are grouped into a council with the largest members being Roman Catholic, with around 22,000 believers, Presbyterian and Anglican churches.

However, as always here, Saturday's celebrations will be a harmonious mix of liturgy and traditional tribal dances, once labelled "evil" and banned by the missionaries.
