Werder Bremen warmed up for Tuesday's titanic Champions League tussle with Barcelona by moving to the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-1 win over Hertha Berlin on Saturday.

Bremen need a point against Barcelona on Tuesday but three were required against Hertha and the title hopefuls delivered thanks to a stellar display from German international Miroslav Klose.

Klose, top-scorer at the World Cup, scored twice (32, 40) to take his season's tally to ten and show Barca he is in top form.

Brazilian playmaker Diego had opened the scoring with a penalty after Josip Simunic, who also scored Hertha's goal, had handled in the area.

Bremen replaced Schalke 04 at the summit but the latter, now one point behind, can reclaim top spot with victory over FC Nuremberg on Sunday.

Champions Bayern Munich lost ground on Bremen after a 1-1 home draw with lowly Borussia Monchengladbach and now trail the leaders by three points.

Argentine Martin Demichelis headed Bayern ahead on 23 minutes but Michael Delura equalised ten minutes later.

Gladbach held on for the point to delight manager Juup Henyckes, who won the German title as Bayern coach in 1989 and 1990.

Bayern now turn their attention to Tuesday's match with Inter Milan in the Champions League where they aim to secure top spot in the group.

But most neutral fans in Germany will be tuning in to the Bremen match with the 2004 champions needing a point at Barcelona's intimidating Nou Camp stadium to eliminate the holders and join Chelsea in the last 16 phase of the competition.

As it stands four teams - Bremen, Schalke, Bayern and Stuttgart, who drew 0-0 with Mainz 05 on Friday, all have the chance to go into the six-week winter break as league leaders.

In the last 12 seasons the 'winter champions' have gone on to win the Bundesliga with the two exceptions being Schalke in 2001 and Bayer Leverkusen in 2002.

Elsewhere Borussia Dortmund recorded a 1-0 win over VfL Wolfsburg with Ebi Smolarek scoring the winner in the 90th minute.

There was speculation that Dortmund were ready to part company with Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk, contracted until June 2008, with Arminia Bielefeld coach Thomas von Heesen said to be lined up as his replacement.

SV Hamburg boss Thomas Doll is another manager feeling the heat after a 2-1 defeat to fellow strugglers VfL Bochum on Saturday that keeps the club second from bottom.

Zvjezdan Misimovic produced a magical free-kick on 70 minutes to down Hamburg, who had Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart sent off for a brutal tackle from behind.

Hamburg are the only founding club never to have been relegated from the Bundesliga but need to turn things around soon to preserve that record.
