Australian Prime Minister John Howard warned Friday that embattled senate deputy president Mal Colston would be voted out if he does not resign amid deepening scandal by the May 6 resumption of parliament.

Howard earlier this week bowed to intensifying pressure to dump the senator over fraudulent travel allowance claims and called for his resignation saying he had referred the allegations to police for investigation.

But the prime minister went a step further Friday and told a television chat show audience: "I'm sure he'll be gone as deputy president before the senate resumes and if he's not we'll vote him out."

He also promised to change the rules for travelling allowances to make the system more transparent, adding he was "quite serious" about devising a system that is as fraud-proof as possible.

Clearly concerned about the damage the scandal appears to be causing the government, he said: "I repeat, 99 percent of members of parliament on both sides are very honest, hardworking men and women."

Colston, whose Brisbane home has been besieged by media crews for two days, was taken to hospital late Thursday suffering from what doctors would describe only as "a medical condition."

"Senator Colston has allowed me to make a statement that says he's here with a medical condition, and he's here to rest," a spokesman said.

The ex-Labor senator turned independent was appointed to the key senate job eight months ago as a reward for giving Howard's conservative coalition the majority it lacked in the upper house by quitting Labor and switching his vote.

Howard's decision followed a statement by Colston staffer Christine Smith retracting earlier evidence accepting responsibility for almost 7,000 dollars (5,500 US) misclaimed for travel allowances "due to sloppy bookingkeeping."

Colston had to repay the cash, which had been claimed for 43 nights in Canberra when he was actually at home in Brisbane.

It also emerged that he was forced in 1983 to repay more than 6,000 dollars misclaimed for charter air travel from a company owned by his wife, and in 1982 repaid nearly 4,200 in misclaimed travel expenses.

The Labor opposition and centrist Democrats, who along with a handful of independents hold the balance of power in the Senate, want Colston to resign from politics altogether -- which would rob Howard of his upper house majority.

Howard refused for weeks to dump Colston, but explained Smith's new statement changed "the basis on which the matter had been seen previously."

The prime minister's announcement came only hours after the government admitted fraud charges had also been laid against a government MP and a former government senator over similar alleged irregularities.
