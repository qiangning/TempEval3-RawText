The Swiss parliament opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by CIA-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists, a parliamentary commission said in a statement Wednesday.

Over the next few weeks, the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights, what steps it took and the level of Swiss intelligence involvement.

"The opening of this inquiry was decided by the delegation of adminstrative commissions during its meeting on Tuesday," the delegation said.

With a host of European countries concerned over possible implication in Washington's "war on terror", questions have been raised about 32 flights by US-registered aircraft in Swiss airspace between early 2003 and December this year.

On November 27, the Swiss government demanded explanations from Washington about 27 overflights of its territory by US planes in 2003 and 2004.

The Swiss foreign ministry said it had demanded explanations from US authorities several times about suspected CIA flights, most recently on November 15 through the Swiss embassy in Washington.

The US embassy in Bern said on Wednesday that the US State Department had still not responded.

The European Parliament on Wednesday agreed to launch an investigation into allegations of CIA prisons after a probe by the Council of Europe rights and democracy group concluded that preliminary evidence suggested the United States illegally abducted and detained individuals.
