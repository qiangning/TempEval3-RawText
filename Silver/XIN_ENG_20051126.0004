The number of cases related to violence against women is increasing by the year in Nepal, a report submitted to the on-going campaign of "Ensure zero tolerance for violence against women" disclosed here on Saturday.

According to the report released by the Forum for Women, Law and Development (FWLD), a non-governmental organization, crime against women in Nepal, especially domestic violence, increased to 922 in 2003-2004 from a total of 569 reported cases of domestic violence in the year of 2002-2003.

Similarly, trafficking and child marriage has increased from the previous year, the report stated.

The toll on women and children is invariable heavy due to the conflict situation as also the fact that higher percentages of the displaced are also women, the report said.

Thousands of women are unable to report to police or are deprived of litigation either due to absence of courts in the countryside due to conflict or because they fear further atrocities from the perpetrators, the report added.

Meanwhile, several United Nations institutions here pointed out that Nepal should strive to ensure that every woman has equal citizenship right, the right to equal property, and equal access to migration and labor.

Jointly organized by United Nations Population Fund and FWLD, the campaign from Friday will last 16 days in marking the International Day for Elimination of Violence against Women.
