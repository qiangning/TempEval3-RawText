A judge at Serbia's war crimes court on Monday jailed 14 former soldiers for to up to 20 years over the massacre of more than 200 prisoners after the siege of the Croatian town of Vukovar in 1991.

The judge gave eight of the 16 defendants the maximum available sentence of 20 years in prison for murdering "at least 200 prisoners of war" in the hamlet of Ovcara near Vukovar after the three-month siege of the northeastern Croatian town.

The 16, including a woman, were charged with taking prisoners from Vukovar's hospital and executing them on a farm at Ovcara after Serb troops overwhelmed Croat defenders at the Danube River town.

Two defendants were cleared of all charges, the woman received a nine-year sentence and the remaining men were jailed for between five to 15 years.

"They are guilty as they, acting as members of the territorial defence from November 20 to November 21, 1991 at the Ovcara farm, tortured, inhumanly treated and murdered at least 200 prisoners of war," Judge Vesko Krstajic told the court in handing down the verdict.

Sentenced to 20 years in jail were Miroljub Vujovic, Stanko Vujanovic, Milan Lancuzanin, Predrag Dragovic, Predrag Milojevic, Ivan Atanasijevic, Djordje Sosic and Miroslav Djankovic.

Those jailed for 15 years were Jovica Peric, Vujo Zlatar Milan Vojnovic, while Predrag Madjarac got 12 years, Nada Kalaba nine years and Goran Mugosa five years.

The special prosecutor plans to appeal the two acquittals and some of the short sentences, according to spokesman Bruno Vekaric.

Still, he welcomed the guilty verdicts because "the crime (massacre), which had previously been denied, has been confirmed and proven."

The defence said it would also mount appeals.

Relatives of the victims were at Monday's ruling in Belgrade along with representatives of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the US and Croatian embassies in the Serbian capital, and human rights activists.

Foreign observers have been attending the trial in Serbia's special war crimes court since it opened in March last year. It was the first major war crimes case to be heard in the former Yugoslav republic.

Serbia set up the special war crimes prosecutor's office in 2003, backed by police and detention units, to deal with allegations arising from the wars of the 1990s in Bosnia, Croatia and the province of Kosovo.

Only six people were initially indicted over the Vukovar massacre; charges against another 11 were filed in March 2004. One of the accused died in custody earlier this year.

The defendants were all members of local territorial defense units, as well as volonteer units fighting along the soldiers.

Vukovar was captured by the Yugoslav army and Serb rebels in November 1991, at the end of the siege, in some of the most brutal fighting of Croatia's 1991-1995 war of independence from the former communist federation.

The town was razed and more than 1,000 civilians were killed, including those at Ovcara, 192 of whom have been identified.

The victims were machine-gunned in groups of about 10 and their bodies were buried in pits at a pig farm outside town, according to the prosecution. The massacre started on November 20 and finished early the next day.

After the war ended, the Vukovar region was put under UN administration and was reintegrated into Croatia in 1998.

The Hague-based UN war crimes tribunal has been trying three Serb officers -- Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Mile Mrksic -- for suspected war crimes committed in Vukovar.
