Rebels in the Ivory Coast continue the secret production and illegal export of diamonds to neighboring countries in violation of a United Nations embargo, a report by UN experts said Wednesday.

The experts "found continued evidence of diamond production in Cote d'Ivoire and illicit exporting of diamonds, especially to Mali," said the report prepared for the UN Security Council.

The report identified Malian buyers which "underlines the significant smuggling of Ivorian diamonds to Mali" where the experts observed the illicit activity in November.

In addition to Ghana and Mali, the experts believed there was regular smuggling of Ivorian diamonds to Guinea.

The UN on December 4 reaffirmed its support for the Kimberley Process (KP), a global initiative designed to stop the market of "blood diamonds" -- sold to pay for warfare -- which includes 47 representatives from 71 countries.

"No action could be taken against Mali," since it is not a member of the certification process, but Ghana could be sanctioned in February 2007, the report said.

It cited an instance when a "suspicious shipment of rough diamonds with a Ghanaian certificate of origin was blocked in Dubai in July 2006," saying the group asked for further information from the United Arab Emirates but got none.

"According to scientific examination, the diamonds were not of Ghanaian origin, and the group was surprised that the United Arab Emirates had released the package to the importer."

In previous reports, the UN experts have said that diamonds were a major source of revenue for the New Forces (FN) rebels which have controlled the north of Ivory Coast since September 2002.

The FN rebels have denied the UN accusations of exploiting the country's diamond wealth, saying they get their money from cocoa and coffee and other products.
