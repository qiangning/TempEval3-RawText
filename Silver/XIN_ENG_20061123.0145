The 14th crew of the International Space Station (ISS) played golf during a nearly six-hour space walk in a Russian program on Thursday, a Mission Control spokesman said.

Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin and U.S. astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria opened the hatches and begun their walk at 0020 GMT on Thursday after a 60-minute delay for technical reasons, said Valery Lyndin, spokesman for the Mission Control Center near Moscow.

According to the Itar-Tass news agency,the pair spent in outer space five hours 38 minutes instead of the planned five hours 47 minutes, Lyndin said.

"Most of the program has been fulfilled," Lyndin said. They played golf, installed a neutron telescope on the exterior of the Zvezda service module, took a picture of an antenna of the Kurs docking system and replaced a WAL 2 antenna.

German astronaut Thomas Reiter assisted the space walk from the ISS.

Tyurin hit a ball with a golf club manufactured by the Canadian firm Element 21 Golf.

The company's chiefs said that they wanted to mark by the space "game of golf" the 35 anniversary of the first "golf strike" made by American astronaut Alan Shepard on the moon surface.

Tyurin's strike, which has entered the Guinness Book of Records, was only a two-minute event, but preparations for it were long. Lopez-Allegria helped him in fixing a device with a spring that sent the ball in a needed direction.

The technical director of the Golf project, Alexander Alexandrov, told reporters that the golf ball would travel "miles and miles" in space, while Shepard's ball flew only 22 feet.

Unlike usual golf balls weighing 35 grams, the space ball weighs only three grams.

Under the contract, the golf club and remaining balls will be returned to the Earth in a Soyuz spacecraft in the spring and turned over to the customers.

Besides the golf, Tyurin and Lopez-Allegria examined the antenna of the Kurs system for problems that arose during the docking of Russia's supply ship Progress with the ISS in late October. They tried to retract the antenna, but failed to do so.

The pair moved a WAL 2 antenna to a more convenient place that will be used during the docking of the European craft ATV, the launch of which is scheduled for the beginning of 2008.
