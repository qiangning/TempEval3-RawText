Some 50,000 Kurds calling for a peaceful resolution to the bloody battle with Ankara for an independent Kurdish homeland, were expected Saturday in Dusseldorf, western Germany, organisers said.

The Kurds were converging here on Saturday from all over Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium for the demonstration, in 450 coaches and two special trains.

At least 10,000 had arrived early Saturday morning, police said. They were due Saturday afternoon to stage a rally at a public space on the banks of the river Rhine.

Some 1,000 police were called in to Dusseldorf to monitor the demonstration.

No incidents were signalled by police.
