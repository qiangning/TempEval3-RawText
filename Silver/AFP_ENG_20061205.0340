A dip in arrivals from Britain, its biggest tourist market, has pushed Paris to re-think the way it packages itself and throw off some of the sniffy stereotypes it has been saddled with.

On Tuesday, the tourist board for the Paris region launched a new ad campaign aimed at Britons that, far from flaunting its well-known monuments and museums, seeks to portray the French capital as an energetic, youthful and trendy city.

The 970,000-euro (1.3-million-dollar) billboard and postcard campaign "is to show Londoners that Paris isn't a stuffy museum city, but that it is a vibrant destination brimming with exiting events that are worth visiting regularly," the board said in a statement.

The ads can be seen on a new website (www.cestsoparis.com), and include, for instance, a picture of the inside of the Versaille palace with partying young things letting loose in the MTV style of Sofia Coppola's recent "Marie Antoinette" movie under the tag: "At Versaille, you're treated like royalty."

The site also features a page of actors in pantomime poses meant to convey common French gestures, such as the "Gallic shrug" or showing when someone is "fed up".

At stake is a strategy to boost the number of British tourists, especially those from London. Britons already account for one in five visitors to Paris, but their flow dropped 0.9 percent last year, to 3.2 million people.
