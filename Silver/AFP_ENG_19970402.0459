The dollar firmed except against the Swiss franc on Wednesday, dealers saying the greenback had risen on technical factors and because US interest rates were relatively high.

In Frankfurt, meanwhile, most economists said that the central council of the Bundesbank was expected to hold its key rates at a meeting on Thursday.

The dollar opened weakly against the Japanese yen but then rallied. The initial weakness was in reaction to the Tankan report by the bank of Japan implying that industrial confidence was improving.

At James Capel economist Ian Morris explained that the dollar had then rallied because US interest rates were higher than Japanese rates.

Analysts said that they did not expect the Japanese central bank to increase its rates and noted that the bank itself expected confidence to falter in the next few months.

The lira rose against the mark on technical factors but was unlikely to maintain this position because "Italian manufacturing industry is suffering and this is likely to cause the bank of Italy to ease its rates," Morris said.

Sterling fell because of uncertainty surrounding a general election on May 1 and because of fears that inflation might emerge, analysts said.

Morris said that British interest rates would be increased after the election but that the market would judge this to be too little, too late.
