An Islamic teacher believed to have recruited suicide bombers was convicted of terrorism by an Indonesian court Wednesday and sentenced to a lifetime jail term.

Subur Sugiarto, 33, is proven guilty of the primary charges of sheltering the country's top terror fugitive Noordin Moh Top, the tightly-guarded District Court in the Central Java capital of Semarang heard.

Malaysian-born Noordin is the suspected brains behind a series of bombings that killed more than 230 people since 2002.

Sugiarto, alias Abu Mujahid, is also convicted of illegal arms possession.

He was arrested in January and brought to trials along with three other militants.

Police believed that Sugiarto was the key aide of Noordin, whose hunting remains fruitless so far.

He has allegedly recruited people to launch suicide bombings, including three young men from Central Java and West Java who carried out triple suicide attacks on Bali island last October, in which 19 people were killed.
