Bangladeshi former main opposition Awami League(AL)-led 14-party combine announced the postponement of the nationwide blockade from Thursday.

President Sheikh Hasina at a press conference at her party's office here announced sit-in demonstrations outside President House from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for November 27 and Election Commission office from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for November 28.

The 14-party combine enforced countrywide water-railway-road blockade on Nov. 20 to press its 11-point demands that include removal of the controversial Chief Election Commissioner, Justice Aziz, and "depoliticization" of the administration for free and fair elections.

To resolve the political crisis prevailing the country, Bangladeshi President Iajuddin Ahmed, who is also the chief advisor of caretaker government, requested Aziz to take a three- month leave and Aziz agreed the request Wednesday night.

Justice Mahfuzur Rahman, one of the three election commissioners, who became Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Thursday, said the main challenge before him is to hold free, fair and acceptable general elections due in January next.
