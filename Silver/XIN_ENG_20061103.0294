Los Angeles and Long Beach ports will use mobile radiation detectors to check containers for nuclear materials as trucks leave the harbor, authorities confirmed on Friday.

The federal government will provide the radiation detectors to the ports so as to enable them to prevent terrorist attacks, law enforcement officials said.

The devices, which will check cargo containers on ships, trucks and trains, are part of a group of 24 portable scanners that will be delivered by January.

The monitors will supplement 85 stationary radiation detectors that have been used at 14 port terminals since June 2005. The devices scan shipping containers for nuclear materials as trucks leave the harbor.

In addition, customs officers use small hand-held detectors on the docks and wharves to check cargo as it is unloaded from ships.

By early next year, the additional scanners will allow customs to scan 100 percent of containers that leave the ports by truck and train. The devices also can be moved outside the harbor to help other law enforcement agencies.

"The technology we have deployed enhances our critical mission of preventing terrorists or others from attempting to smuggle weapons of mass destruction through U.S. borders," Customs and Border Protection Commissioner W. Ralph Basham told the Los Angeles Times.

But critics say the devices have difficulty reading the low levels of radioactivity emitted by nuclear weapons; and they cannot detect radioactive materials if they are well shielded.
