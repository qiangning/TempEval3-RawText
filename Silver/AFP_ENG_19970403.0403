A rare black gibbon has been born at South Africa's national zoo in Pretoria, the zoo announced Thursday.

Some 31,000 black gibbons disappear each year, making it "extremely important ... to coordinate their breeding programmes," the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa said in a statement.

The tiny primates known for their agility were once common in China, but their numbers have dwindled steadily because of hunting and deforestation. They are now found only in the far south of China and east of the Mekong River in Southeast Asia, the zoo said in a statement.

Since 1992, the Pretoria zoo has been home to the only pair of black gibbons in Africa. A total of 53 specimens of the vanishing species are in captivity around the world.
