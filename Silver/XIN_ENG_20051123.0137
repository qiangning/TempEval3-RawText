A light trainer plane crash off on Wednesday in the northern Philippines, killing the pilot and injuring his student, the military said.

Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Restituto Padilla told a press briefing that the Cessna trainer jet, with tail No. RPC-727, crashed at around 1:30 p.m. in Alabat island in Quezon for still unknown reasons.

The ill-fated aircraft is owned by Master Flying School, said Padilla.

According to Padilla, this was the third crashed Cessna planes this year in the country.

In May, an aircraft hit a coconut tree and burst into flames after taking off from a private airstrip in Tanauan town in Batangas province, killing four people.

In March, another Cessna plane crashed into the sea off Jomalig Island in Quezon while transporting fish products from Palawan to Manila.
