Australia, which opposes capital punishment, said Saturday it respected Iraq's decision to execute former dictator Saddam Hussein, calling it a "significant moment" for the war-torn country.

"No matter what one might think about the death penalty, and the government of Iraq is aware of the Australian government's position on capital punishment, we must also respect the right of sovereign states to pass judgement relating to crimes committed against their people, within their jurisdictions," Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said in a statement.

"He has been brought to justice, following a process of fair trial and appeal, something he denied to countless thousands of victims of his regime."

Australia contributed troops to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which led to the ouster of Saddam. It still has about 1,300 troops involved in operations in the area.

Downer said it was a credit to the people of Iraq that Saddam has been granted a fair trial for crimes against humanity involving the execution in 1982 of 148 Shiite men and boys in the village of Dujail.

"The people of Iraq now know that their brutal dictator will never come back to lead them," the foreign minister said.

"While many will continue to grieve over their personal loss under his rule, his death marks an important step in consigning his tyrannical regime to the judgement of history and pursuing a process of reconciliation now and in the future."

The Australian government, along with its coalition allies, would continue to "support the struggle of the vast majority of Iraq's people to preserve and build upon the progress which has been achieved, where even the cruellest of dictators can be tried and brought to justice", said Downer.

But the leader of the opposition Labor party, Kevin Rudd, called the government's support for Saddam's execution hypocritical, given it regularly seeks clemency for Australian nationals facing the death penalty overseas.

"It is not possible in our view to be selective in the application of this policy," Rudd said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Sydney resident Issam Abdulla, who fled Iraq more than 20 years ago, said he had "no feeling at all" about the former dictator's death, saying it had come too late to remedy his homeland's spiralling violence.

"It's not making me happy but it's making me feel sorry why all this has happened," said the 55-year-old.

"The damage is done."

However other Iraqis living in Australia, some of whom said they had lost family during Saddam's reign, welcomed the news, making plans to celebrate late into the night in the Sydney suburb of Auburn.
