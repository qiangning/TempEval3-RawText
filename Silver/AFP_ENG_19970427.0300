India's premier investigating agency said Sunday a senior government politician was to be prosecuted along with 54 other bureaucrats and politicians in a multimillion dollar scandal.

The politicians and bureaucrats are accused of siphoning off 271-million dollars in government funds meant for buying cattle feed, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said.

Among those to be charged is Laloo Prasad Yadav, a senior member of Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's Janata Dal (People's Party).

CBI director Joginder Singh took the decision to prosecute late Sunday after "considering evidence and material on record and reports of other investigating officers," a CBI spokesman said.

"We also took the opinion of legal officers of the CBI before going ahead with prosecuting the accused," he said.
