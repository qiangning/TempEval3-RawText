The Indian government was braced for a storm in parliament Monday after fresh allegations that the former foreign minister and the ruling Congress party were involved in a scam to profit from a UN oil-for-food deal in Iraq.

"We will be adopting an aggressive posture" during the coming week in parliament, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, a leader of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said Sunday.

"We will insist on Natwar Singh's resignation from the union cabinet and Sonia Gandhi's resignation as chairperson of the National Advisory Council," a body that provides an interface between the government and civil society, Malhotra said.

Malhotra's comments followed new revelations at the weekend by a former Indian ambassador and Congress insider that former foreign minister Natwar Singh and the Congress party got special vouchers to purchase oil cheaply from Baghdad in 2001.

In an interview with India Today magazine, Anil Matherani, India's former envoy to Croatia, said the Iraqis had rewarded Singh with an oil allotment for his "personal service."

Matherani, who said the comments were not for publication and taken out of context, worked closely with Natwar Singh in the Congress party before being posted as ambassador to Croatia. He was recalled to Delhi at the weekend after his revelations.

"The fact of the matter is that both allottees ... in my view are exactly the same ... one has been (given) to Natwar and the other one to the Congress party," Matherani told the national news weekly.

Singh led a four-member team to Iraq in 2001 that included Matherani.

"One (was) for Natwar's personal services. Don't forget that he has been the one who has been espousing Iraq's cause."

The comments caused a furore in parliament late Friday and the opposition demanded afresh that Singh be dumped from his current role as cabinet minister without portfolio that was assigned during an investigation into oil-for-food allegations made in a United Nations report.

Singh was also sacked from his post in the Congress Steering Committee, the party's highest decision-making body overnight, a decision taken in a meeting chaired by Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi, a Congress party spokesman said Monday.

It came after Singh, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, refused to resign from his cabinet post Sunday.

In October, former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said in a report to the UN that former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's regime manipulated the oil-for-food programme to extract about 1.8 billion dollars in surcharges and bribes.

Volcker named Singh as a beneficiary of four million barrels of Iraqi oil allotted to Zurich-based firm Masefield AG.

Congress, India's oldest political party, is also listed as a beneficiary of a separate allotment of four million barrels of oil as part of the transactions.

Singh has consistently denied any wrongdoing, as has the Congress party.

But the opposition, whose earlier campaign to embarrass the government in parliament through a discussion and vote fell through last week, seemed determined to capitalise on the opportunity presented by Matherani's revelations.

Political analysts described the crisis as the biggest challenge yet for the Manmohan Singh-led government which completed one year in office in May.

"It's a very, very big problem for the government," said T.R. Ramachandran, bureau chief of the Tribune newspaper.

"The target (for the opposition) has shifted from Natwar Singh to Sonia Gandhi. Congress strategists are trying their best to deflect the flak from her," he said.

Another analyst Rashid Kidwai, who has written a biography of Sonia Gandhi, said the controversy had snowballed into a major crisis through "inept handling."

"I do not think the party realised the gravity of the situation."
