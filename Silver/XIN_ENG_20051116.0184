Remnants of the former Taliban regime have resorted to Iraqi style militants activities in the post-Taliban Afghanistan as the rebels conducted three suicide attacks over the past three days leaving at least 10 killed and over a dozen wounded.

The militias in their latest wave of violence rammed a car laden with explosives in a US military convoy in Kandahar, the former stronghold of Taliban Wednesday morning killing at least four and injuring four others.

Though the authorities denied any casualties to the US military, the locals said the explosion inflicted loses to the occupants of the US army vehicle.

Kandahar is the second military base of some 20,000-strong US- led coalition troops in Afghanistan after Bagram, 50 km north of Kabul, where a Bagram-bound transport plane crashed last Friday and Taliban claimed to shoot it down for carrying communities equipment to the US troops Headquarters.

In the previous double deadly attacks which shocked the war- weary capital city on Monday, at least six people including a German soldier of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were killed and 11 others including two Germans and one Greek were wounded.

Wednesday's suicide bomb attack is the ninth of its kind over the past two months, a phenomenon rarely reported in the conservative Muslim society of Afghanistan.

Remnants of the former fundamentalist regime in mine attack carried out near a US military base in the southeast restive Paktika province on Tuesday killed one US soldier and wounded another. Two Afghan troops were also wounded in the attack.

Similar mine attack in the same province, according to officials claimed the lives of five police officers and injured two others on the same day while the police have taken two suspected Taliban fighters in this case so far.

The new tactics of violence the suicide attack, which is forbidden in Islam, has been taking place in the post-Taliban nation amid reported appointment of two Arab nationals by Osama- led al-Qaida network as the commanders of foreigners' fighters in Afghanistan.

The newly appointed militants' commanders, according to media, including Abdul Hadi Iraqi and Khalid Habib, have come from the insurgency-plaguing Iraq to conduct activities in Afghanistan.

Ayman Al-Zawahir, the second in command of al-Qaida hierarchy and a wanted man by Washington, in a message some months back warned to intensify militancy against the US military in both Afghanistan and Iraq and tried to prove both the lands as quagmire for the US and allies.

Both the Arab nationals have been tasked to command anti- government militants in the south and southeast of the war- shattered Afghanistan.

Afghan Defense Ministry has also admitted last month that reported penetration of terrorists suicide attackers in big cities including the capital and said the law enforcing agencies have taken all necessary and precautionary measures to foil the terrorists designs.

Furthermore, a Taliban commander Mullah Ahmadullah from his unknown location told media that the radical movement had prepared some 300 volunteers suicide bombers to mount pressure on Afghan and foreign forces stationed here.

Spokesman of the ousted regime Qari Yusuf Ahmadi also claimed that three Afghans loyal to the movement carried out the bloody suicide bomb explosions in the capital city on Monday.

Taliban's fugitive supreme leader Mullah Mohammad Omar whose regime was ousted by US military in late 2001 in a recent message on the eve of Eidul Feter, the religious festival, to mark the end of the Muslim fasting month called on his loyalists and compatriots to continue Jihad or holy war until the withdrawal of US-dominated foreign troops from Afghanistan.
