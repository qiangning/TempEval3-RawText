The schoolteacher in central China's Hunan Province, whose case was diagnosed as pneumonia of unknown cause, is recovering.

Monday's check showed the 36-year-old patient surnamed Song is recovering and he's reported normal body temperature for ten consecutive days, said Ouyang Fan, a doctor at a Xiangtan hospital.

Song still coughs occasionally, but hemoptysis disappeared, the doctor said.

The CT screening shows the abnormal symptoms at Song's left lung are disappearing, and Song is gaining confidence on his recovery, said Huang Qiusheng, doctor who is in charge of Song's case.

Some doctors in the hospital said Song's case is rather rare and suggests a great possibility of viral pneumonia.

Song came from Wantang Village in Xiangtan County where a bird flu outbreak was reported. Experts presently diagnosed his illness as pneumonia of unknown cause, but do not rule out a possible human case of bird flu.

Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is carrying out further tests for the patient.
