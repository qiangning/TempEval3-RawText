After introducing jet aircraft service on domestic routes, Cosmic Air, the leading private Nepali airline is gearing up to use its Fokker-100 jet aircraft for mountain flights from Sunday, a statement released by the airline stated on Thursday.

The airline's inaugural mountain flight with its Fokker-100 jet has provided passengers a "spectacular" view of the world's highest peak Mt. Qomolangma and Annapurna mountain ranges on Wednesday.

"We are the first airline in Nepal to use a Boeing for mountain flights covering both the Himalayan ranges," deputy director of sales and marketing division of Cosmic Air Simrik Shrestha said.

The airline is expected to begin its scheduled mountain flights with its Fokker from Nov. 20.

There were 72 passengers, including journalists and crew members, on board the 108 seater aircraft, according to Shrestha.

Mountains of Ganesh Himal, Langtang, Gauri Shankar, Cho Oyu, Pumori, Qomolangma, Kanchenjunga, Manaslu, Annapurna, Machhapuchhre are some of the peaks that can be seen during the mountain flight, he said.

The airline intends to sell only 84 out of 108 air seats per flight so as to provide a better view of the mountains to the passengers.

"The mountain flight today made me feel as if I were in heaven. I felt like I was on top of the mountains," 41-year-old Spanish tourist, Maria Carmen Sane, said.

"It was amazing to see the mountains, I found Mt. Pumori the prettiest of all the mountains," another Spanish tourist, Pablo Uriarte Masio, said.
