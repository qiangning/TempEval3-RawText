Kobe Bryant poured in a season-high 58 points, but it wasn't enough to stop the Charlotte Bobcats from pouncing for a triple-overtime victory over his Lakers on Friday.

Charlotte's Emeka Okafor was able to dominate the paint, and Matt Carroll scored a career-high 27 points off the bench as Charlotte ultimatedly downed the Lakers 133-124 in a National Basketball Association contest.

Okafor had 22 points and a franchise-record 25 rebounds for the Bobcats, who picked up a victory in the first triple-overtime game in club history in front of the largest crowd ever to see a game in Charlotte.

Bryant shot 22-of-45 from the field and 10-of-12 from the line to record the second-highest scoring performance in the NBA this season. Washington guard Gilbert Arenas scored 60 points against the Lakers on December 17.

However, in the third extra session, Bryant committed one of the cardinal sins of defense.

With his team trailing by two points with 1:14 left, he fouled reserve Derek Anderson, who was attempting a 3-pointer.

Anderson nailed all three foul shots to make it 129-124, and Los Angeles was unable to get any closer.

On the ensuing possession, Bryant fouled out of the game, committing a charge on a wild drive to the basket but leaving with the third-highest scoring game of his career.

Last season, Bryant scored a franchise-record 81 points against Toronto and 62 points in a game against Dallas.
