An impoverished widow in eastern India had her head forcibly shaved after a wealthy farmer accused her of stealing his bananas, a report said Tuesday.

Desri Devi was allegedly caught stealing bananas from a field in Balua-Basant village in poverty-ridden Bihar state last week, the Press Trust of India reported,

Village officials fined her 2,500 rupees (56 dollars) but when she could not pay they summoned a barber who shaved her head, the news agency said.

"Some people wanted me to be stripped and then paraded on the streets, but others stopped them from doing that. Still, I was paraded in the lanes of the village for no fault of mine," Devi said in a complaint lodged with police.

District magistrate Lallan Singh said the woman, who was a beggar, had "sleepwalked" to the field where the nightwatchman caught her taking bananas, according to the news agency.

Earlier this week, the Times of India reported that a landowner in the same state had chopped off the fingers of a 10-year-old girl's right hand to punish her for stealing spinach leaves to eat.

Despite India's fast-growing economy, hunger remains a major problem in the country. Some 42 percent of Biharis live under India's official poverty line compared with a nationwide average of 26 percent.
