The Supreme Court in Liberia has rejected football star George Weah's allegation of fraud in the presidential runoff and referred them to the National Elections Commission (NEC), Weah's spokesman Sam Quiah told Xinhua on Saturday.

Weah had protested to the NEC that Tuesday's run-off that pits him against Harvard-trained Iron Lady Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.

He alleged that pre-marked ballot papers intended to be stuffed in ballot boxes in favor of his challenger were intercepted by his supporters and presented photo copy of same to the NEC as evidence to prove his claims.

But while ruling into the case was pending before the NEC, Weah 's party took flight to the Supreme Court, seeking a writ of prohibition on the NEC from announcing the results in which Johnson-Sirleaf has won with 59.4 percent as 97 percent of all polling places has been counted.

"The Supreme Court did the right thing because it cannot go into the case in the absence of a ruling from the NEC," a Liberian legal expert told Xinhua.

International observers including the European Union, regional bloc ECOWAS and the Carter Center were unanimous in their observation that the election was free, fair and transparent.

Calm has returned to Liberian capital of Monrovia following Friday's demonstration in which at least two people were injured when thousands of supporters of the football star took to the streets in what they described as a "peaceful demonstration to show to the international community that there were fraud in the presidential run-off election."

The UN police used tear gas to disperse some of the demonstrators at the diplomatic enclave of Mamba Point in Monrovia, when, according to Liberian police sources, the demonstrators began "throwing stones and attempted to go beyond police lines."
