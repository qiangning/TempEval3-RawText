The State Reserves Bureau under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is going to auction 20,000 tons of copper reserves in a bid to ease tight supply in domestic market, China Daily reported on Thursday.

The auction will be held on Nov. 16 and the sign-up date for the auction will close on Nov. 14, the paper said, quoting a notice posted on the website of the NDRC, a State Council department responsible for the macro-regulation of the national economy.

The bureau's move confirmed long-circulating speculation in the market that it would sell copper reserves to bring down the runaway copper price.

The high copper prices, spurred by the large demand, have jumped from 1,779 US dollars per ton in 2003 to 3,328 dollars per ton in the first half of this year.

Industry analysts estimate the bureau has about 200,000 tons of copper stockpiles, the exact figure is treated as a State secret in China.

The soaring copper prices, which has increased profit margin in the copper smelting industry, has led the government to fear the making of an investment bubble, prompting the NDRC to announce last month that the government will soon introduce a slew of measures to rein in the investment in the copper smelting industry.

Analysts, however, said the bureau's latest move will be effective in the short term, but not in the long-term if the demand remains robust in the domestic market.
