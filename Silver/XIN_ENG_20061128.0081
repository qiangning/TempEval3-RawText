A man in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region went on trail on Tuesday, accused of raping and killing nine women and girls over a period of ten years.

The results will be announced in two or three days, according to the Intermediate People's Court of Hohhot City, the regional capital.

Zhao Zhihong, 34, was allegedly involved in 21 cases of murder, rape, robbery and larceny between 1996 and 2005, according to the People's Procuratorate of Hohhot.

His victims are said to have included a college student, a government employee, a female taxi driver and a 12-year-old girl.

When he was arrested on Oct. 23 last year, Zhao had been working in a private kindergarten in Hohhot for more than two years, doing manual repairs and working as a driver. None of the kindergarten pupils or personnel were among his victims.

Regional police offered a reward of 200,000 yuan (25,300 U.S. dollars) for information leading to his capture.

Police said that Zhao, a native of Liangcheng County in Inner Mongolia, was originally a carpenter in a village of Liangcheng. He later moved to Hohhot.

From there, he drifted all over Inner Mongolia. He is accused of crimes in Hohhot, Togtoh County, Tumd Zuoqi Banner and Ulanqab City.

Zhao had been sentenced to six-month jail for larceny in Hohhot in October, 2003.

An earlier attempt to prosecute Zhao failed because of a lack of evidence.
