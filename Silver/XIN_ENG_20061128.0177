DOHA, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- Forget Liu Xiang. The most popular Asian Games athlete picked by Chinese netizens is not even on the Chinese team.

Zhu Chen, former Chinese women's world chess champion who will represent her adopted country Qatar in the Dec. 1-15 games, has beaten the Chinese Olympic hurdles champion in an online popularity vote.

The 30-year-old chess beauty, who married to Qatari Grandmaster Mohammed Al-Modiahki in 2000, changed her citizenship to the oil- rich gulf country in early 2006 in a controversial transfer.

In Tuesday's telephone interview with Xinhua, Zhu said she felt relaxed representing Qatar.

"I don't have a specific goal for the Asian Games," she said. " Nobody pushes you as in China. I just want to have a normal performance."

Zhu, who grabbed her first world crown in 1988 at the World Under-12 Girls Championship, has won the world titles at all levels, taking the World Junior Girls Chess Championship in 1994 and 1996 and the World Chess Championship in 2002.

Zhu, born in east China's Zhejiang Province, has been living in a two-storied house in Doha with his husband in the past few years. To prepare for the games, she left their two-year-old daughter to her parents' care in China.

"I sent her back two months ago because I am very busy with training and I don't feel well sometimes," she said. "The other reason is that my parents missed her very much. She was brought up by my parents and my uncle and all of them cried when she moved here."

Zhu said that she is getting well along with her parents-in-law in Doha and has accustomed to living in the Arab country.

"My parents-in-law are very nice to me. They are both very open- minded. In general, all the Qatari people are very friendly. The only thing I cannot understand when I first came here is their slow-rhythm life. They do everything in a slow pace," she said.

Zhu gets up late everyday, trains with her husband every afternoon for four to five hours a day. She enjoys the leisure life by walking on the seaside, swimming and fishing.

"I also learned a little scuba-diving. We have barbecue in the farm. I don't feel bored here even though the life here is not as colorful as in China."

Nicknamed "Chess Beauty Queen" by Chinese fans, Zhu has felt pressure of age. "As a 30-year-old chess player, I feel pressure. Everybody will get old, no exception with chess players."

Zhu hopes that her appearance in the Asian Games for Qatar will give the country a boost in the mind sport.

"There are not many people playing chess in Qatar," she said. " Fortunately, the royal family of Qatar likes sports. They have put a lot of heart and resources in hosting the Asian Games and tennis, golf and table tennis tournaments. They will also stage chess competitions next year."

Zhu said she will bring her daughter back to Qatar as soon as possible after the Asian Games.

"It's difficult to juggle between chess and family," she said. "But I always remind myself that my family, including my parents, my daughter and my husband, is more important than playing chess. I want to spend more time with my daughter."

Zhu's switch of allegiance had caused resentment from a few Chinese, who called her "traitor", but her immense popularity remains undented.

"I know there are many people missing me and looking out for me. Their support is always important. I am very thankful," she said.

Zhu said that she still enjoys playing chess, which is part of her life.

"Maybe I will play in the Chinese Chess League next year, although playing in China will put me under a lot of pressure."
