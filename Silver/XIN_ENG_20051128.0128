An Asia-Pacific regional seminar on sustainable water management, organized by the Germany- Singapore Environmental Technology Agency (GSETA), opened here on Monday.

With the participation of some 70 experts and government officials from Germany, Singapore and 15 other economies in the region, the three-day meeting focuses on the latest developments, technological advances, best practices and upcoming challenges faced in sustainable water and waste water management.

"The need to implement sound environmental and water policies is a key priority for all countries, especially since the world population continues to grow rapidly and natural resources become more limited," Singapore Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Yaacob Ibrahim said at the opening ceremony.

He added that long-term integrated water management and planning, technology, as well as getting the public engaged in water conservation, are important factors in ensuring sustainable use of water around the world.

Established in 1991 by the governments of Germany and Singapore, the GSETA has organized 16 regional activities relating to various environmental issues with the aim of transferring environmental know-how and expertise into the Asia-Pacific region.
