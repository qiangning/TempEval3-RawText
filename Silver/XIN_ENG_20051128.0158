The National Assembly (NA) of Vietnam approved the anti-corruption law at its working session on Monday, Vietnam News Agency reported.

Under the law, a central steering committee on anti-corruption led by Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai will be set up. The government will take responsibility of annually informing the NA about its work on the issues.

The law also regulates that media agencies and reporters have the rights of asking relevant organizations to provide documents relating to corruption. In the cases that the organizations are unable to response, they have to give reasons in the form of documents.

The law developed from an ordinance on the issue is an important legal document for Vietnam's fight against corruption, NA Chairman Nguyen Van An, said, adding that the government, especially Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, the NA, and the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee, need to vigorously act to help the law implemented effectively.

Last weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung reaffirmed Vietnam's determination to combat corruption. The government has instructed relevant agencies to effectively increase management over land-related issues and the use of public prosperity, the two domains which have involved in most corruption cases, and accelerated restructuring state-owned enterprises, he said.

The 8th session of the 11th National Assembly, which kicked off on Oct. 18, is scheduled to conclude on Nov. 30. During the session, it plans to pass 14 bills, including those on intellectual property, electronic transactions, housing, anti- corruption, tender, and amendment and complement to some articles in the law on value-added tax and the law on luxury tax.
