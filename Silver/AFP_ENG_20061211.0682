Georgia's Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli met US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Monday, seeking US support in his country's diplomatic showdown with Russia.

Kicking off a four-day stay in Washington, which includes talks Tuesday with Vice President Dick Cheney, Nogaideli also met national security advisor Stephen Hadley and US Trade Representative Susan Schwab.

As he left the State Department after meeting Rice, Nogaideli called on Russia to join in a bid to end the diplomatic spat set off when Georgia arrested four Russian soldiers in September and accused them of spying.

"The most important issue in relations with Russia for us today is the resolution of territorial conflicts," said Nogaideli.

"We think instead of blaming each other ... we need to move ahead with peace plan implementation in the region and we have discused this with Secretary Rice," he said.

Terry Davidson, a State Department spokesman, said Rice and her visitor discussed a full range of regional security issues, including the Georgian dispute with breakaway regions Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Rice also touched on Georgia's relations with Russia and energy resources in the region, Davidson said.

The United States has strongly backed the Georgian leadership of President Mikheil Saakashvili, who hopes to take his country into the NATO military alliance.

Georgia freed the military officers in October, but the United States has been urging Moscow to lift a sweeping raft of sanctions and for both sides to lower rhetoric.

Russia vehemently opposes Georgia's bid to join NATO and accuses Georgia of planning military action against Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are supported by Moscow.
