Chinese film director Chen Kaige, who received a controversial nomination for a "Green Chinese" award, didn't make the short list for the awards which was released on Sunday.

Chen Kaige's 340-million-yuan (42 million US dollars) film, "The Promise" damaged the environment near a pristine lake shore in Shangri-la in southwest Yunnan Province, according to the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).

Another controversial nominee, director Zhang Jizhong, who was accused of damaging the Jiuzhaigou National Park during filming also didn't make the short list.

Wang Panpu, secretary-general of the award's organizing committee, said Chen and Zhang were ranked well down on the list of 235 nominees and were quickly eliminated from the 24-person short list.

Chen and Zhang's nominations announced a month ago stirred a hot debate on the Internet and in the media.

The "Green Chinese" annual award is co-sponsored by seven government departments and supported by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), which selects five to ten Chinese who have made a significant contribution to protecting the environment.

Internet users were encouraged to submit their own nominations which are checked for eligibility by the organizing committee, said a spokeswoman for the awards.

Many netizens described the nomination of the directors as an outrageous irony.

"Most Internet users wrote that Chen was a negative example but if it wasn't for his movie there wouldn't have been such a huge debate about environmental protection," the spokeswoman said.

Zhang Jizhong apologized for damaging the environment during the shooting of his film.

Chen Kaige's film production company was fined 90,000 yuan for damaging the lake near Shangrila.
