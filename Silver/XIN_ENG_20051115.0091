US-based premier information aggregating and integrating services company, OneSource Information Services, announced Tuesday the official open of its office in Hong Kong.

At the launching ceremony, Vice President of Europe and Asia Pacific of OneSource Paul Brown, said that the Hong Kong office was primarily a sales and support operation responsible for growing OneSource's business and servicing clients in the region.

It also oversaw business activities in the Mainland market and served as a base for expanding the company's business network in this part of the world.

"The free flow of information in the city is also crucial for business intelligence companies like us. And more importantly, Hong Kong provides a natural base for our entry into the Mainland market with its proximity and enormous experience of doing business with Mainland enterprises," said Brown.

"The opening of OneSource in Hong Kong has once again shown that Hong Kong is the preferred location for world-class business services providers to operate in the region," said Director-General of Investment Promotion at Invest Hong Kong Mike Rowse.

OneSource is a subsidiary of the NASDAQ-listed infoUSA. In addition to its headquarters in Massachusetts, US, and the new Hong Kong office, OneSource also has offices in London, Sydney and Singapore.

The company helps clients to increase productivity and effectiveness by distilling, combining and organizing business information, including industry profiles, executive biographies, business press coverage and financial data.

Invest Hong Kong is the Hong Kong government department charged with encouraging and facilitating inward investment into the city by providing all the support needed to establish a business presence here.
