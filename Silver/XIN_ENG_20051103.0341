Chile reiterated Thursday it will continue exercising sovereignty and jurisdiction over a disputed area in the Pacific Ocean, defying a recent bill approved by Peru's Congress that seeks to redraw maritime borders between the two countries.

"I've just handed over to the Peruvian Ambassador to Chile a diplomatic note of our country," said Chilean Foreign Minister Ignacio Walker ahead of a cabinet meeting.

The note reiterated "what already is known to all, in the sense that we will strictly abide by international law, exercising sovereignty and jurisdiction over what is Chilean territory," said the minister.

Earlier Thursday, the Peruvian Congress approved a bill that claims sovereignty over a sea area covering 35,000 square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean along the South American coastline, which currently belongs to Chile.

From 1879 to 1883, Chile fought the War of Pacific against Peru and Bolivia, winning Bolivia's only sea outlet Antofagasta.

According to the Chilean government, Chile's border with Peru was already resolved in the 1952 and 1954 treaties. But Peru claimed that it never signed any maritime demarcation pact with Chile. Relations between the two countries have been strained recently due to the sea border dispute.

On Wednesday, Chilean President Ricardo Lagos reaffirmed that "Chile will continue claiming sovereignty over its maritime territory."

Following the decision by the Peruvian Congress on Thursday, security has been tightened around the premises of the Peruvian Embassy in Santiago.
