Trinidad and Tobago will play the first leg of the two-match play-offs against Bahrain for a place in the 2006 German World Cup, in Port of Spain, capital of the Caribbean island nation, local media said on Friday.

Trinidad wants to achieve its first ever World Cup apperance, with the help of stars from the British football league Dwight Yorke, formerly of Manchester United, and Russell Latapy.

The team has won three of the last four matches, boosted by new coach Leo Beenhakker of the Netherlands, who was hired after the Caribbeans suffered a painful 5-1 defeat at the hands of Guatemala.

"This is our biggest ever effort to qualify for the World Cup yet and we are going to grab it with both hands," said Trinidad's sports minister.

Bahrain, managed by Luka Peruzovic, was in the third place in the Asian region finals. Among its star players are Hussain Ali and Mohammed Hubail, from the Qatari league, rated the strongest in its region.
