Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki pledged Wednesday to arrest all those carried out kidnappings in Baghdad within the "open battle with terrorists."

"We feel sorry to what happened yesterday, but I pledge that we will trail those who put their hands in the hands of the devil," Maliki told a gathering at a Baghdad university.

"This is an open battle with terrorists whatever their names are," Maliki said during his visit to the university after mass abduction of the Higher Education Ministry employees on Tuesday.

The state-run television reported Tuesday that gunmen wearing Iraqi police commando uniform stormed the ministry's Research Directorate building in the Nidhal Street in Karradah district, kidnapping scores of male employees.

"It is not enough for us to release some captives, but also we are keen to bring those kidnappers to justice," he said.

Maliki also said that he rejects any sectarian and political activities in the Iraqi universities.

The Iraqi Higher Education Minister, Abed Thiyab al-Ajili, said Tuesday that the number of hostages was more than 100, including male employees and visitors.

However, the Interior Ministry sources said the number of hostages in the hands of the kidnappers was exaggerated.

Late Tuesday, at least 15 hostages of the mass kidnapping were released, local security and education sources said.

According to the released hostages, there were only some 40 people had been held hostages by the unidentified gunmen.
