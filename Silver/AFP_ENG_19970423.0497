Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, opened an international gathering of legislators here Wednesday with a hopeful message about the future of his Himalayan homeland.

China, whose invasion of Tibet caused the Dalai Lama to flee to India in the 1950s, "is changing," he told a rapt audience overflowing a US congressional chamber.

"A growing number of Chinese show concern, in some cases a spirit of solidarity" with Tibetans, he said, opening a World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet that drew delegates from 27 countries. "There is real hope."

Speaking without notes and in English for 30 minutes, the Buddhist monk cut a smiling saffron-and-burgundy figure in a room usually dominated by pinstripes.

He was to meet later in the day with President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the White House, which will surely draw consternation from Beijing.

Organizers said he would seek greater US support for the six million Tibetans now living under what Western governments and human rights groups describe as increasingly heavy-handed and abusive Chinese rule.

China's official media reserve their most colorful insults for Taiwan leaders and the Dalai Lama alike, routinely accusing both of "trying to split the (Chinese) motherland."

During the Dalai Lama's recent six-day visit to Taiwan, one official Chinese newspaper accused the Buddhist monk and the Taiwan authorities of conniving together to divide China.

On Wednesday, the Dalai Lama indicated that he would likely open an office in Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province, within a month: "It is finalized," he told reporters.

"I feel indirectly that I'm helping the Chinese government," the 61 -year-old cleric said. "Stability under a weapon isn't genuine stability -- genuine stability comes from satisfaction."

China would likely dispute both those assertions, and a newsletter from the Chinese embassy here left little doubt this week that it wants to thwart international support for 1989 Nobel laureate and his followers.

An eight-page embassy document described substantial economic advances in Tibet under Chinese rule and attacked the Dalai Lama's own human rights record, saying "the laws the Dalai Lama used in Tibet were the cruelest in the world."

The conference this week is hosted by the International Campaign for Tibet and Tibet's parliament in exile.

The Dalai Lama was also expected to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. He earlier held private talks with members of Congress.

China's People's Liberation Army invaded Tibet in 1951. The Dalai Lama was forced into exile in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Beijing's rule.
