Iran on Saturday vowed it would defy the UN Security Council's decision to impose sanctions by pressing ahead with its nuclear programme and drastically increasing uranium enrichment capacities.

Foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said that Iran would carry out its plan to install and make operational 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges at a key nuclear plant, in defiance of the resolution.

Such a move would be an important step for Iran towards enriching uranium on an industrial scale. So far it has two cascades of 164 centrifuges at its uranium enrichment plant in the central city of Natanz.

"This new resolution will not be an impediment to Iran's nuclear progress," Hosseini said, in a statement published by Iranian official media minutes after the resolution was unanimously agreed.

"The Iranian nation, relying on national abilities and within the framework of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its undeniable rights, will go ahead with its peaceful nuclear plans."

He said this would involve "making operational the 3,000 centrifuges unit in Natanz, in a continuation of Iran's peaceful nuclear activities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."

Iran has maintained that it wants to install the new centrifuges by March and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said the Islamic republic will be able to celebrate its "nuclearisation" around that time.

After weeks of diplomatic wrangling, the UN Security Council on Saturday adopted the resolution which imposes restrictions on Iran's nuclear industry and ballistic missile programme.

Western countries have sought to agree the sanctions in response to Tehran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment, a process which they fear could be used to make a nuclear bomb.

Enriched uranium can be used both to make nuclear fuel and also, in highly enriched form, the explosive core of a nuclear bomb. Iran insists its atomic drive is peaceful.

"The Islamic Republic of Iran finds the adoption of the new resolution to be illegal and beyond the duties of the UN Security Council and contrary to the rules of the UN charter," said Hosseini.

The spokesman lashed out at its arch enemy United States as well as Britain for exploiting the UN Security Council while at the same time "expanding their own nuclear arsenal."

"This illegal action by the United States and Britain on the UN Security Council will solidify Iranians' will to guard their independence, national sovereignty and preserve their rights for the future of Iran," he said.

Hosseini however did not give details of any retaliation that Iran could itself impose to hit back at sanctions. Top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani has warned of "painful measures" in the case of sanctions.

But senior Iranian lawmakers warned on Saturday that parliament could hit back at the Security Council sanctions against Tehran by blocking United Nations inspections of its nuclear facilities.

A bill to suspend inspections of Iran's atomic sites by the UN nuclear watchdog has already been prepared by parliament and passed by its security and foreign affairs committee.

"The committee has approved a bill, whereby Iran will seriously revise the nature of its relationship with the International Atomic Energy Agency," speaker Gholam Ali Hadad Adel told state television.

"We will have no other option but to bring this bill before parliament for debate, if Iran comes under pressure," he said.

Iran in February stopped applying the additional protocol to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which allows extensive access to atomic sites, after the Security Council adopted a resolution urging Tehran to freeze enrichment.

However, up until now it has still been allowing regular UN inspections of its atomic sites.
