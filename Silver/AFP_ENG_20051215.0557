US President George W. Bush on Thursday hailed Iraq's historic parliamentary elections as "a major step forward" in building a democracy in the war-torn country and bringing US troops home.

"Millions of people voted. And I haven't seen all the tabulations of the vote, but we're certain that the turnout was significant and that the violence was down," he said as he met with Iraqis who cast absentee ballots.

"This is a major step forward in achieving our objective, which is having a democratic Iraq, a country able to sustain itself and defend itself, a country that will be an ally in the war on terror, and a country which will send such a powerful example to others in the region, whether they live in Iran or Syria," he said.

Bush has said that successful elections and training Iraqi security forces will allow him to call home some of the roughly 160,000 US soldiers in Iraq -- though he has rejected calls to set a deadline for a complete withdrawal.

"They've expressed concern about listening to the commentary that we'll leave before the job is done. They don't have to worry," he said. "The United States will stay with them and complete this job."

The Iraq war, in which more than 2,140 US troops have been killed, has badly hit the Republican president's popularity. Opposition Democrats are stepping up calls for a timetable for a military withdrawal.

Earlier, White House spokesman Scott McClellan also gave an upbeat assessment of the election.

"The reports that we've received I think indicate that the turnout is high throughout Iraq, that any violence appears to be relatively low," said McClellan.

"The Iraqi people are showing the world that all people of all backgrounds want to be able to choose their own leaders and live in freedom," he said.

An Iraqi official, Hussein al-Hindawi, said in Baghdad that turnout "was very strong in all regions," even in some areas where violence has been at its worst since the March 2003 invasion to oust Saddam.

More than 15.5 million Iraqis were called to the polls Thursday to elect the 275 MPs who will sit in the parliament and elect the president.

Ahead of the vote Bush has given four key speeches in a bid to convince the US public that he has a strategy for Iraq and that conditions in the war torn country are improving.

He has insisted that he was right to order the March 2003 invasion and that a hurried withdrawal would be "a recipe for disaster".

But in a speech on Wednesday, Bush also took responsibility for ordering the invasion based on intelligence that "turned out to be wrong" about Saddam's weapons capability.

"As president, I'm responsible for the decision to go into Iraq -- and I'm also responsible for fixing what went wrong by reforming our intelligence capabilities. And we're doing just that," he said.

Bush's campaign appears to have halted his popularity slide.

According to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday, Bush's approval ratings have improved by a percentage point in the last month to 39 percent. Fifty-five percent still disapprove of his record.

The poll said 60 percent of Americans want a gradual reduction in the 160,000 US troops currently in Iraq -- four percentage points from last month.
