Accompanied by Vice Premiers Wu Yi and Hui Liangyu, Wen came to the Beijing Kexing Biological Product Company on Thursday morning for inspection of China's research on bird flu human vaccine.

Kexing company, the first in the world to develop SARS vaccines, is now taking joint effort with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to research bird flu human vaccine.

Chinese scientists have developed human vaccines for the bird flu and will carry out clinical tests in days.

Millions of chickens, ducks, geese and other poultry have been culled after bird flu outbreaks were reported in Xinjiang, Liaoning, Hubei, Anhui and Hunan provinces.

China's health authorities have confirmed on Wednesday the first two human infection cases of bird flu in the country, and enhanced efforts to prevent and control the epidemic.

The two confirmed cases involve a nine-year-old boy in Xiangtan County of Hunan Province and a 24-year-old woman farmer in Zongyang County of Anhui Province. The boy has been discharged from hospital. The woman died on November 10.

When coming to the vaccine workshop, Wen watched carefully the whole process of vaccine manufacture and packing, frequently asking questions about the progress of vaccine research and development, technical characteristics and producing capacity.

"The public pay great attention to the vaccine safety problem, which should not be overlooked," Wen told company leaders.

Later Wen paid a visit to the institute researching and manufacturing medicines for treatment of human cases of bird flu. He said he was happy to know that progress has been made in researching such medicine.

"Currently China's bird flu prevention and control situation is severe," said Wen after his inspection tour.

"Prevention of human infection of bird flu and safeguarding people's health and safety are the focus of the prevention work," he said.

The efficient prevention and control work of highly pathogenic bird flu epidemic depends on science and technology, he said.

China has made important breakthroughs in researching fowl-use vaccines and substantive progress in researching human-use vaccines and medicines, he said.

He called for new progress in bird flu vaccine, medicine research and production, as well as in monitoring migratory birds.

China hastened to fight bird flu earlier this month, when a cabinet meeting chaired by Premier Wen decided to set aside 2 billion yuan (248 million dollars) to check the spreading of the virus. On Tuesday, China announced plans to vaccinate its more than 14 billion farm birds.
