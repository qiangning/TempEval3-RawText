The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the 2008 Olympic Games (BOCOG) has launched its Olympic lecturers team to cope with increasing demand for knowledge about the Olympics.

The team is composed of heads of relevant BOCOG departments and its key staff members, who will serve as a bridge linking BOCOG and all walks of life, urging them to actively spread Olympic knowledge, listen to the voice of the community and answer the inquiries.

In August 2005, a small group was set up to give lectures on the Olympics, with up to 200 Olympic-themed lectures held so far.
