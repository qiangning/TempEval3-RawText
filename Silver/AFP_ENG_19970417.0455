Grain and cattle prices bounced back on Chicago's future markets here Thursday a day after slumping on an unsubstantiated report that the death of an Indiana man was linked to "mad cow" disease.

Wednesday's market plunge had been sparked by a newspaper report that Joseph Gabor, a 62-year-old farmer from Schererville, a small Indiana town just south here, had died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).

Indiana veterinary officials insisted that CJD, a fatal brain-wasting disease that afflicts humans, is not the same disease as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow" disease.

An epidemic of BSE in Britain last year sparked worldwide concern about beef consumption and led to a European Union ban on British beef imports.

"There are those who have alleged the two are connected, but scientific research has never positively established a link," said Indiana State Veterinarian Bret Marsh.

"We hope the market gets some logic back because it was purely overreaction and emotional hype. There was no scientific basis for this to happen," Denise Derrer, a spokeswoman for the Indian State Board of Animal Health, told AFP.

Chicago's futures market seemed to agree Thursday. "The scare is over, Grain and cattle prices are back up," said Chicago Mercantile Exchange spokeswoman Annette Wallace.

"We had the same situation last year when (talk-show queen) Oprah Winfrey did a show on the mad cow scare in Britain."

Victor Lespinasse, vice president of the Chicago brokerage firm Dean, Witt Reynolds, dismissed the mad cow link as a "ridiculous story" and an "overblown thing."

The report carried by the Times newspaper in Hammond, Indiana, said Gabor, a retired electrician who used bone meal to help fertilize his rose garden, had been diagnosed with CJD three weeks before his death.

There has been speculation that prions, a distorted protein molecule, could be transmitted from sheep or cows to humans through bone meal made from infected animals.

"Regardless of what Gabor died from, he could not be BSE, because humans do not get that disease and it (BSE) does not exist in the United States, let alone Indiana," Derrer said.

Dr. Danae Bixler of the Indiana State Department of Health meanwhile pointed out that a human dying of CJD in Indiana was not unheard of.

"Indiana has experienced about five deaths per year from CJD in the last few years. The case rate (for the disease) worldwide is about one case per million people."

Indiana officials said state statistics showed that since 1933 all but one CJD death had occurred in individuals over 55 years age and therefore the death of 62-year-old Gabor did not arouse suspicion.

US federal officials confirmed that extensive monitoring of the US cattle population had not identified a single case of BSE in the United States.

And since 1989, strict import rules on live animals and animal products have been implemented to protect the country's beef and dairy industries.
