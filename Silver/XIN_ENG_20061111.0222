Arab League (AL) Secretary General Amr Moussa on Saturday regretted the U.S. veto against a United Nations Security Council draft resolution condemning the Israeli attacks against the Palestinian civilians.

Expressing anger and astonishment over the U.S. veto, Moussa said in a statement that the veto would fuel anger over the U.S. protection to the Israeli practices against the Palestinian civilians.

The Arabs would urge the UN General Assembly to take actions to provide protection for civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories and call for respect for the international law, he stressed, adding that the U.S. veto would encourage Israel to continue its aggression.

Arab foreign ministers will discuss the latest developments at an emergency meeting on Sunday, Moussa added.

The United States on Saturday vetoed the UN Security Council draft resolution that would have condemned an Israeli attack in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza that killed at least 19 Palestinian civilians, and urging a quick withdrawal of Israeli forces from the area.
