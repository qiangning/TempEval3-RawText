An earthquake with a magnitude of 5. 3 on the Richter scale shook Turkey's central province of Malatya on Saturday.

No casualty was reported.

Semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted officials of an observatory center as saying that the quake occurred at 17:56 p.m. (1556 GMT) and that the epicenter of the quake was at the Poturge town of Malatya.

Malatya Governor Osman Derya Kadioglu was quoted as saying that there were no reports of any casualties or damage after the quake which was felt in Malatya and surrounding provinces.

Earthquakes are frequent in Turkey. A strong quake hit western Turkey in 1999, leaving more than 18,000 people dead.
