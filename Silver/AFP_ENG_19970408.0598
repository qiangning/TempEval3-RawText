Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday urged the international community to denounce the escalating human rights violations in Burma and restore the democracy snatched away by the ruling military junta.

"There are hardly any human rights which have not been violated by this military regime. And we need strong action from the international community to put an end to these constant violations of basic human rights," Aung San Suu Kyi said.

She further asked the international community to implement a general assembly resolution, calling for the restoration of democracy in Burma.

"Our political rights are getting fewer and fewer by the day. There are more restrictions, more repression, the autorities seem determined to crush any kind of political movement," the opposition leader said in a video message, smuggled out of Burma and delivered to the 53rd session of the annual session of the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva.

The European Union is expected to present a resolution condemning Burma to the commission.

Last month, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Burma denounced arbitrary executions, torture, forced labour, deportation, rape and the general climate of fear under Burma's ruling junta.

The junta in 1990 cancelled the election victory of the opposition National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi.

The opposition leader accused the government of persecuting its opponents, their sympathisers and their families through economic pressure and carrying out arrests on the basis of trumped up charges.

For the past three months, all of her visitors have been filtered by the military and she said access is often denied to diplomats and foreign journalists.

Aung Sang Suu Kyi urged the United Nations to ensure that the UN human rights rapporteur to Burma should be authorised to travel to the country and she further called for the establishment of a human rights surveillance group.

Lastly, she called on Thai authorities to welcome refugees driven out by the Burmese army's offensive against ethnic minorities carried out earlier this year.

She is anxious that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees should have access to the approximately 100,000 refugees that the Thai authorities are preparing to send back to Burma following an agreement with the ruling military.
