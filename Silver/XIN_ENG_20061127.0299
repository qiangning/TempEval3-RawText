The Zimbabwean government will next month buy 75 more ambulances to alleviate the shortage of transport in hospitals and clinics throughout the country, the official The Herald reported on Monday.

At a workshop for parliamentarians on reproductive health here, Secretary for Health and Child Welfare Edward Mabiza said the fleet would be imported from South Africa at 16 million rand (2.24 million U.S. dollars).

The move by the government, Mabiza said, was aimed at improving the quality of health care in the country. He added that the government has also embarked on a program to refurbish the old ambulance fleet.

Operations at most clinics and district hospitals were being adversely affected by shortages of ambulances because some of the vehicles were old while others had broken down.

Many hospitals around the country experience serious shortages of ambulances and the worst affected are rural districts and rural health centers.
