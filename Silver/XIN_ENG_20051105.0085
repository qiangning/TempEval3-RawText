A delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by Liu Yunshan, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, arrived here on Saturday for a five-day official goodwill visit at the invitation of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the royalist FUNCINPEC party.

Liu and the delegation were greeted at the Siem Reap International Airport by senior leaders of the CPP and the FUNCINPEC, including CPP Secretary-General Say Chhum and Vice- Prime Minister and FUNCINPEC party Secretary-General Prince Norodom Sirivudh.

During his stay in Cambodia, Liu is scheduled to meet with King Norodom Sihamoni; Chea Sim, Senate president and the CPP's chairman; Prince Norodom Ranariddh, National Assembly president and president of the FUNCINPEC; and Hun Sen, prime minister and vice-chairman of the CPP, according to officials of the Chinese Embassy here.
