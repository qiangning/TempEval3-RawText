World football governing body FIFA has suspended a list of international referees submitted by Kenya last month after allegations of graft in their recruitment and ordered immediate investigations.

In a letter to Kenya Football Federation (KFF), FIFA deputy general secretary Michael Schallhart said the football world governing body had launched immediate probe into the exercise.

"The FIFA Referees Committee has decided to suspend the lists of nominations submitted by Kenya Football Federation (KFF) until further notice," Schallart said in a letter to KFF.

An investigation has been started. The graft allegations were revealed last month by Kenya Football Referees Association secretary-general G.M.T. Ottieno, a week after FIFA suspended the east African nation from international competition indefinitely.

The government dissolved the federation 10 days later and set up a caretaker committee to run the sport. FIFA has also dismissed the caretaker committee appointed by the government last week to oversee the running of the football.

The world's soccer governing body indefinitely suspended Kenya from international competition on October 24 for failing to respect signed agreements and for recurrent problems in the KFF.

While dissolving the federation, Sports Minister Maina Kamanda said he was compelled to take the radical action to restore order and normalcy in the management of football.

The seven man committee which comprises former lawmakers, journalists and sports administrators will oversee the country's football "re-birth".
