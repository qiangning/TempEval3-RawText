The US economy increased at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the third quarter of this year, higher than the 3.8 percent rate announced at the end of last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.

The strong gain followed an increase of 3.3 percent in second quarter and is the best showing of the US economy in more than a year -- it is equal to the growth rate in the first quarter of 2004.

Analysts said that the performance offered a fresh testimony that the overall US economic situation had managed to improve despite the destructive hurricanes which hit Gulf coastal areas in August and September.

The report showed that US consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the US gross domestic product (GDP) and is the lifeblood of economic growth, grew at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the third quarter, stronger than the 3.9 percent growth rate previously estimated. The revised figure marked the fastest pace in consumer spending since the final quarter of 2004.

US nonresidential fixed investment increased at a rate of 8.8 percent in the third quarter, the same as in the second quarter. However, businesses spending on equipment and software increased at a 10.8 percent annual rate during the quarter. That was better than the 8.9 percent growth rate first estimated for the period and close to the 10.9 percent growth rate seen in the second quarter.

Investment in housing construction and other residential projects grew at a brisk 8.4 percent pace in the third quarter. That was up considerably from the 4.8 percent growth rate initially estimated but was down from the 10.8 percent pace registered in the second quarter.

US export of goods and services increased 0.8 percent in this quarter, compared with a strong gain of 10.7 percent in the previous quarter. Imports increased 2.1 percent in the July-September quarter in contrast to a decrease of 0.3 percent in the second quarter.
