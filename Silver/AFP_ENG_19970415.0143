Former Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan expressed his dismay at the military's breakdown in discipline, command and control five months before the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) staged a revolt in March, a commission of inquiry was told here Tuesday.

Chan's concern followed the killings on September 8 last year of 12 soldiers at Kangu Beach care centre in Bougainville, scene of a long- running civil war.

Justice Warwick Andrew is holding an inquiry into the hiring of mercenaries to fight in Bougainville, prompted by sacked PNGDF commander Brigadier General Jerry Singirok who led the revolt by calling for Chan's resignation.

Chan "stepped aside" pending the outcome of the inquiry.

Singirok threatened to walk out of the hearing earlier Tuesday if he was questioned over a political assassination.

The inquiry was also told of a US embargo on the sale of military helicopters to PNG and of concern that a large slice of 10 million kina (7.2 million US dollars) allocated for a military operation was used to furnish Singirok's home.

Singirok was questioned by Marshall Cooke, counsel for the PNG State, over Operation High Speed 2, conducted last July in Bougainville to knock out the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA).

Cooke produced a letter Chan wrote on October 31 to Defence Minister Mathias Ijape which described High Speed as a fiasco which reflected a "lack of proper planning and coordination by the principal staff officers."  "The Kangu massacre was clear evidence of the total breakdown in command and control from the Headquarters PNGDF right down to the lower echelon of command and control on Bougainville operations and I fear and hope that this is not the same throughout the force," Chan wrote.

"The Kangu massacre and the latest capture of three soldiers continues to highlight the serious breakdown of discipline, command and control."

Singirok told the inquiry the breakdown was "a direct reflection on the lack of support, lack of direction by our politicians." He rejected responsibility for the deaths.

The commission also heard a preliminary audit of High Speed spending had found 39,335 kina had been spent on curtains and carpets, 10,875 kina for furnishings and 45,000 kina for cutlery at Flag House, the commander's official residency. Also spent was 13,963 kina for overseas travel and 28,000 kina on two parties.

Evidence produced Tuesday showed the US State Department turned down a request from the PNGDF to supply them with 10 surplus US military Iroquois for 240,000 US dollars each.

In the end the country agreed a deal with the mercenary company Sandline International, which included two Mil-17 former Soviet transport helicopters and two Mil-21 attack helicopters.

Cooke raised the issue of the gunning down of Bougainville provincial premier Theodore Miriung on October 12 last year.

A coroner's inquiry found elements of the PNGDF carried out the killing.

Cooke asked Singirok whether he was cooperating with the police investigation.

"All the way," Singirok replied.

"I will advise the commission that because the issue of the killing of Miriung is still under police investigation, I do not wish to make any comment. If I am probed I will leave the court room," Singirok said.
