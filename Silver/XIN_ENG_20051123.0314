The Dallas Mavericks guard Doug Christie is considering retirement because of his recurring sore left ankle, reports from Dallas said.

Christie went home to Seattle last week to have the surgically repaired ankle examined by his personal physician. He missed the final 24 games last season for Orlando because of bone spurs in his ankle that were removed.

Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said Tuesday that he expects to know within a few days what Christie will do. Retirement is an option, he said.

The 35-year-old Christie, in his 14th NBA season, signed a three-year contract with Dallas in August, but only the $3.15 million for the first season is guaranteed.

Christie played the first seven games this season for Dallas, averaging just 3.7 points and 2.0 assists a game. He got permission to go home and hasn't been with the team the last three games, including Tuesday night's 102-93 victory over Houston.
