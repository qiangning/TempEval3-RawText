US Trade Representative Rob Portman Saturday said India must help in solving the standoff in farm talks to conclude the current round of global trade negotiations, Indo-Asian News Service reported.

"Unless we solve this problem of agriculture and non- agriculture market access, it would not be possible to move this round including a reduction in industrial tariff," Portman told a meeting with Indian industry here.

"But unless the European Union comes out with a proposal to reduce its tariff, it would be difficult to move ahead in the round," he told members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

Portman, on a two-day visit to India, said New Delhi must reduce agriculture tariff for greater market access to developed countries like the United States, even while admitting that unless European Union cuts subsidies, the talks will remain inconclusive.

His visit came ahead of a crucial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Hong Kong next month and in the backdrop of the deadlock in negotiations at Geneva and London last week to conclude the Doha round of global trade talks.

Indian Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said the India and the United States had agreed to double bilateral trade to 40 billion US dollars by 2008.

India currently exports merchandise worth 14 billion US dollars to the United States and imports goods worth 7 billion US dollars.

In the 30-minute talks, discussions also veered around the upcoming Ministerial of the WTO in Hong Kong to conclude the next round of trade talks that have so far been deadlocked over rigid positions of developing and developed countries.
