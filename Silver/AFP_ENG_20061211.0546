President Michelle Bachelet defended her decision Monday to deny ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet a state funeral as a step for the good of Chile, while the international community lamented that he escaped justice for his regime's brutality.

A long line formed to see Pinochet's body as he lied in a coffin wearing his grey general's uniform inside Santiago's Military School, a day after his death sparked wild celebrations in the streets of the capital.

Even after his death, Pinochet remained a divisive figure, with detractors calling his 1973-1990 regime an era of violent repression while supporters hailed his fierce anti-communism and free-market policies.

But human rights groups and media commentators worldwide lamented that in his death Pinochet had escaped justice for thousands of dead and missing during his rule.

Former army leader Pinochet, who died in Santiago's Military Hospital Sunday at age 91 a week after suffering a heart attack, has been given a military farewell with his funeral taking place in the Military School's courtyard Tuesday.

His face and chest could be seen through a glass window as his coffin was flanked by eight honor guards and two huge candles. Several masses and prayers were scheduled in a chapel at the Military School's hall.

Bachelet, who along with her parents was detained and tortured by Pinochet's regime, refused to give Pinochet full state honors with a national mourning period.

"In any society, in any country, when there are not norms, or predetermined laws for a particular situation, it is up to the leaders, the government, to make decisions in the best interests of the people," Bachelet said.

"Over the past several hours we have seen divisive acts that we don't like, but as a society and as a country we have to have the ethical strength to overcome this challenge," the Socialist said.

Pinochet's youngest son, Marco Antonio, decried the absence of a national funeral for his father, who, he said, "was totally committed to his country and took it out of indescribable chaos."

The contrast between the sorrow of Pinochet's supporters and jubilation of his detractors showed the deep divisions still felt in Chile 16 years after the return to democracy.

Thousands of people celebrated in the streets of Santiago Sunday after Pinochet's death, while about 2,000 of his supporters gathered at the Military Hospital Sunday to mourn his passing.

The celebrations were marred, however, by clashes between hooded radicals and police officers. Authorities said 99 people were arrested and 43 police injured in the violence.

While leftist politicians condemned his 17-year rule that left 3,000 people dead or missing, by official count, the right recalled his economic policies that it said led to the "Chilean miracle."

Human rights groups and newspapers across the world expressed disappointment that Pinochet died without ever facing trial for the killings and torture committed under his rule.

Amnesty International said Pinochet's death underscored the importance of swiftly prosecuting human rights abusers.

"General Pinochet's death should be a wake-up call for the authorities in Chile and governments everywhere, reminding them of the importance of speedy justice for human rights crimes, something Pinochet himself has now escaped," the human rights group said.

The American newspaper USA Today said "Bringing a dictator to justice is about more than revenge."

"It is needed for a society to face up to past crimes and to deter brutal dictators elsewhere," the national daily said.

After the funeral, Pinochet's body will be taken by helicopter to a crematorium and his ashes will be handed to his family.

Pinochet came to power in a 1973 military coup that ousted Socialist president Salvador Allende, who committed suicide at the time. After Pinochet lost a 1988 referendum on his continued rule, he handed over power in 1990 to a transitional government.

In the succeeding years numerous prosecutors and judges sought to have him tried on charges of murder, human rights abuses and corruption, but he fended off trial by claiming immunity and then ill health.

During Pinochet's 91st birthday celebrations on November 25, his wife read a message saying that the former dictator held "no grudge against anyone," despite all the "persecutions and injustices" against him.
