Oil-rich Kazakhstan's veteran President Nursultan Nazarbayev has scored a landslide re-election to a new seven year term, officials said Monday, sparking claims of fraud from the opposition.

Nazarbayev, 65, won 91.01 percent of ballots cast in Sunday's poll in the giant Central Asian country, according to preliminary results, said Central Election Commission chairman Onalsyn Zhumabekov in the capital Astana.

"He won. Congratulations to the candidate."

Nazarbayev, whose 16-year rule has transformed this former Soviet backwater into an emerging world oil power, was due to hold a rally with supporters in Astana.

International observers were also due to deliver their verdict on the conduct of the election.

According to officials, leading challenger Zharmakhan Tuyakbai secured just 6.64 percent. Former labour minister Alikhan Baimenov got 1.65 percent, Yerasyl Abilkasymov of the People's Communist Party 0.38 percent, and Mels Yeleusizov of the environmentalist Tabigat movement 0.32 percent.

But the former Soviet apparatchik's crushing victory was marred by opposition claims of cheating.

"I can only regret that Nazarbayev wasn't given 120 or 150 percent," Aidos Sarimov, a spokesman for Tuyakbai, told AFP after the official announcement.

Earlier, Sarimov vowed legal challenges to what he said had been "multiple violations of the law," including falsification of voter lists. He also said that the official turnout of about 77 percent was inflated.

Tuyakbai has warned previously that Kazakhstan faces dictatorship under Nazarbayev. However, the opposition has so far indicated that it will abide by a law banning street demonstrations in the immediate aftermath of the election.

In his furious reaction, Communist candidate Abilkasymov said: "It's nonsense. ... This is what happens when people vote on command."

A Nazarbayev victory had long been predicted, though not always by such a wide margin. Independent analysts say the one-time steel worker, who rose through Communist Party ranks to head Soviet Kazakhstan in 1989, enjoys solid support.

Under his rule, Kazakhstan has become the most prosperous and stable part of Central Asia, largely thanks to billions of dollars of foreign investment in the country's Caspian Sea oil fields. Kazakhstan is set to become a top-10 world oil producer within a decade.

But the republic, which is roughly the size of western Europe or India and was once part of Genghis Khan's empire, has never held an election judged free and fair by Western observers.

Even before the election, the opposition complained that media bias and pressure from the authorities had made a fair campaign impossible.

Nazarbayev, who went in sub-zero temperatures to vote at a theatre in Astana, said: "These elections will be more democratic than ever before."

About 1,600 observers monitored the election, including some 465 from the influential Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was due to issue its report on the conduct of voting later Monday.
