One foreign oil worker was killed and another injured on Wednesday in a hostage rescue mission launched by the Nigerian military.

They were among the seven oil workers taken hostage by gunmen from an oil installation in south Nigeria on early Wednesday. The other five were freed in the operation.

No details of the dead and the wounded were available now.

Occupying oil facilities or taking oil workers hostage is common in southern Nigeria as local people are angry for not benefiting from oil exploration and instead suffer from pollution discharged from the industry.
