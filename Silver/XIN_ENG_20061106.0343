Rival Lebanese leaders resumed roundtable talks on Monday to discuss possible government changes amid an abyss between Shiite Hezbollah group and the anti-Syrian parliamentary majority that could lead to street protests.

Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, describing Monday's session an "ice breaker," said Lebanon's top leaders would meet again on Tuesday morning, Lebanon's local media reported.

"We agreed to a news media truce," Berri told the local reporters after the four-hour meeting at parliament building in downtown Beirut which began at 11:00 a.m.(0900 GMT).

This was a reference to the political bickering between Hezbollah and its allies from one side and the Lebanese parliament majority, or March 14 Forces on the other, which was highlighted by threats from both sides to take to streets.

All 13 "first-rank" politicians attended the dialogue amid tight security, except for Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah for safety reasons.

However, Nasrallah was represented by cabinet minister Mohammed Fneish as well as parliament members Mohammed Raad and Hussein Hajj Hassan.

Earlier, Berri has called for the resumption of the stalled national talks among Lebanon's rival leaders to consider a national unity government and the adoption of a new electoral law to end the political stalemate.

The dialogue, launched in early March, was last scheduled for July 25. But the outbreak of the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah conflict on July 12 has prevented the resumption of the talks, said the report.
