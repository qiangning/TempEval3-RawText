Zambia's sole oil refinery plant has resumed its full production after a one-month shutdown for annual routine maintenance, Saturday Post reported.

The local newspaper quoted sources of Indeni refinery plant as saying, "the plant resumed full production this week. Of course this was after the crude oil we were waiting for from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was fully stocked."

Among the products it has begun supplying at the market are diesel, jet fuel, heavy fuel oil, petrol, liquefied petroleum gas and bitumen, said the report.

Last month's shutdown, which was postponed twice, has been without incident. Indeni Managing Director Luis Urbano said the country did not experience any disruption in fuel supplies.

The country experienced a crippling fuel shortage last year when the Zambian-French joint venture in Ndola, capital of Copperbelt province, was shut down for maintenance.
