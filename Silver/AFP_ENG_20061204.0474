The leader of Iraq's largest Shiite party urged senior US officials Monday not to withdraw US troops from his country but to transfer more military authority to the government in Baghdad.

Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, head of the pro-Iranian Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), told reporters he had "frank and transparent" talks with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the future US role in Iraq.

Iraq's government "asked for American forces to remain in Iraq while transferring more authority to Iraqi officials and forces to enable them to deal with terrorism," he said.

Hakim also heads the Iranian-backed United Iraqi Alliance, a conservative Shiite coalition which is the largest bloc in Iraq's parliament, but he insisted he was carrying no message from the Iranians for Washington.

The cleric was due to meet later Monday with President George W. Bush as the US leader mulls a major shift in US policy on Iraq.

Bush and Rice met last week in Jordan with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who also demanded that his government take over greater responsibility for the country's security some three-and-a-half years after US forces toppled Saddam Hussein.

Since his Republican party lost control of Congress in elections last month that were dominated by voter unhappiness over the war in Iraq, Bush has been under intense pressure to unveil a plan for gradually reducing the US military role there.

He is due to receive on Wednesday a much-awaited report from the congressionally-mandated Iraq Study Group, which is expected to call for a withdrawal of almost all US combat troops from Iraq by early 2008, while leaving some soldiers behind for training and support of Iraqi forces.
