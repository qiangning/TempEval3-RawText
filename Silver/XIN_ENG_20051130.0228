The Swedish government has announced it is organizing a new alarm center to help it react to crises like the Asian tsunami, in which more than 500 Swedes died, Radio Sweden reported on Wednesday.

The government is under pressure from critics who say it responded too slowly for the thousands of Swedish vacationers who were in the region just under a year ago.

The crisis center is to watch for events around the world 24 hours a day, analyzing crises and advising the government on what kind of action is needed, the report said.

The government announcement came just before a commission is due to make its report on Sweden's reaction to the tsunami. It is expected to be highly critical.
