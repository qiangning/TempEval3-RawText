Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday met with three leaders of the Serbian opposition, in a further US effort to distance itself from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.

"The United States supports the efforts of the Zajedno coalition and the other democratic forces in Serbia to lead Serbia out of the dead end it currently finds itself in and to begin the process of developing a modern European country," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

Burns said the meeting was intended "to underscore the very strong support that the United States gives to democratic change in Serbia."

Albright met with the three members of the opposition Zajedno coalition, Vuk Draskovic, Zoran Djindjic and Vesna Pesic.

It was the first time the leaders had met with State Department officials since recent political turmoil broke out in Serbia.

The high-profile US support also comes at a crucial time when Serbia prepares for key legislative and presidential elections at the end of the year.
