Fifty-three birds have died at a British quarantine center hit by an outbreak of avian flu, according to a report released on Tuesday by the British Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

The report said that within the species documented as coming from Taiwan, only the Mesias were infected with H5N1, adding that 53 out of 101 birds had died. It went on to say that the H5N1 virus was only transmitted between the Mesias,

There is no evidence of transmission to other species in the facility including the sentinel birds.

Announcing the publication of the report, Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds said, "This report contains significant epidemiological findings and helps to further our understanding of highly pathogenic avian influenza.

"In particular the apparent lack of transmission of H5N1 between species in the facility will be of interest to the international community."

In a written Parliamentary statement, Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett said, "This report will be fed into the independent review of avian quarantine procedures I announced on October 31 led by Professor Nigel Dimmock and to Essex County Council, who are conducting an investigation into events at the quarantine facility."
