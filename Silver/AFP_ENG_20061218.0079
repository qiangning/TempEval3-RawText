Dexia bank, a big shareholder in pan-European stock market operator Euronext, will vote against a merger between the operator and the New York Stock Exchange, chief executive Axel Miller said on Tuesday.

He told the French financial newspaper Les Echos: "We will vote against the trans-Atlantic merger project."

This was because the bank felt that the NYSE would eventually dominate the new entity and because the merger ran counter to Euronext's original vision of a pan-European stock market.

"It would be sort of like the birth of America Next," he added.

Euronext groups the stock markets in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, and the Liffe financial futures market in London, and its shareholders are to vote Tuesday on the planned merger with the NYSE.

Miller also objected that "under the cover of an open market, the United States is demonstrating regulatory hegemony."

He forecast that other members of a pact of Euronext shareholders that disbanded last week would also vote against the deal, but stressed he could speak only for his company.

On June 1, the boards of the two markets signed an agreement in principle under which the NYSE was valued at 22 billion euros (28.8 billion dollars) and Euronext at about 10.5 billion euros.

The marriage was presented as a "merger of equals". But a report, strongly critical of the deal, published by an association of financial interests in France called Paris Europlace, said that the marriage amounted to a takeover by the NYSE.
