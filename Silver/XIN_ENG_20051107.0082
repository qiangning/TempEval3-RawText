The chief of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Monday expressed confidence that the rape case involving six US servicemen would not affect future military exercises between Philippine and US forces.

"They (exercises) would not be affected," AFP chief Generoso Senga said in an interview after swearing in the new sets of officers of the Air Material Wing Savings and Loan Association Inc.

Senga said he is also confident that the Visiting Forces Agreement would not be affected by the case. The agreement states that Philippine authorities shall have the jurisdiction over US personnel with offenses committed within the Philippines.

"The agreement will stay as an agreement until the parties withdraw from the agreement. That's a case that's covered by the agreement so that will not damage the agreement," the AFP chief said.

At least 20 exercises are being held yearly by US and Philippine troops under the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951 and the Visiting Forces Agreement of 1998, which governs the conduct of US forces while on training in the Philippines.

The six US marine servicemen were on rest and recreation after a joint training at the former US naval base in Subic Bay when they allegedly raped a 22-year-old Filipina from Zamboanga City on Nov. 1.
