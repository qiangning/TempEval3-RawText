Russian gas giant Gazprom plans to hike the price of natural gas supplied to Georgia to 230 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic meters next year from the 110 dollars it is paying now, a company source said on Thursday.

The new price was part of proposals sent to the Georgian side from Gazprom, the source was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.

Gazprom nearly doubled the price of gas supplied to Ukraine at the start of this year, and deals reached this past month would allow Ukraine to import gas from Russia next year at a moderately higher price than this year.
