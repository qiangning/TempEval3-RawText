Turkish Foreign Ministry on Tuesday strongly condemned killing of Lebanese Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel.

"We strongly condemn this attack which aims to deteriorate peace and stability in Lebanon. We believe Lebanese government and people will not allow such attacks to deteriorate the efforts of national consensus in the country," the ministry said in a statement.

The ministry also offered condolences to the family of Gemayel as well as Lebanese people.

"We hope perpetrators of this attack will be found soon. Turkey is ready to provide every type of support for settlement of peace and stability in Lebanon," the ministry added.

Gemayel was killed by a gunshot on his head Tuesday afternoon when his convoy was attacked by unknown gunmen in Jedeide, about 15 km northeast from Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The 34-year-old Gemayel was also a Christian leader in Lebanon and son of former president Amin Gemayel.
