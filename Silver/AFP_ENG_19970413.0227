Pope John Paul II's appeal Sunday for peace and understanding in Bosnia got a mixed hearing from the faithful here, hopeful that tolerance will emerge but doubtful if it will happen soon.

Acknowledging the wounds caused by Europe's bloodiest war in 50 years, the pope told an open-air mass in Sarajevo Sunday: "Let us forgive and let us ask for forgiveness.

"If Christ is to be our advocate with the Father, we cannot fail to utter these words. We cannot fail to undertake the difficult but necessary pilgrimage of forgiveness, which leads to a profound reconciliation," the pontiff said.

For some, the message itself would help spread peace.

"This is a big event, it will bring peace, harmony and love to all of us," said 64-year-old Tilda, from the Croat-held town of Kiseljak.

"I believe it is possible to forgive, I would not come if I did not think reconciliation was possible," she said.

Others thought tolerance and reconciliation might take time.

"It will take some time before everyone forgives -- there were many victims," said Anto Zlatun, 48, from the mixed Moslem-Croat town of Novi Travnik.

"In myself lost my brother. Reconciliation is not possible right now, but in two or three years it will be necessary."

"I did not have any fears of coming to Sarajevo" said his wife, Antija. "If he (the pope) was ready to come, why should I not come as well?"

Almost all Bosnia's Catholics are Croats from outside Sarajevo, and most of the estimated 30,000 who attended the papal mass headed to more than 400 buses and to trains for the journey home after the three-hour service.

Jelena Glavas, a 17-year-old from the town of Osara agreed reconciliation could not happen soon. "Reconciliation is possible, but not now. Maybe later," she said.

"No, no, life together is not possible," said her teenaged friend, who refused to be named. "I cannot forget what happened, or forgive those who did it."

For the pope, "Of course, forgiveness, far from precluding the search for truth, actually requires it because an essential requisite for forgiveness and reconciliation is justice. But it still remains true that asking and granting forgiveness is something profoundly worthy of man."

But for 57-year-old Jelica, a Croat from Serb-held Banja Luka, the site of savage ethnic cleansing by Serb paramilitary units of Croats and Moslems during the 43-month war, while there will be peace, there will not be forgiveness.

"We feel great, everything will be OK, there will be peace, it does not matter who you are," she said. But, she added: "We can forgive but we won't go to the houses of those who did something."
