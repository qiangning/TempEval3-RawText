Australian police arrested 19 people during a night of simmering unrest in Sydney as they prepared for a major crackdown on a feared new outbreak of racial violence at the weekend, officers said Friday.

Armed with new powers granted by an emergency session of the New South Wales state parliament, police set up check points on a number of main roads in Sydney's troubled southern suburbs.

A wave of arrests followed after several incidents, including a Molotov cocktail thrown at police, an elderly man attacked with a crowbar and an officer injured in a brawl, Assistant Commissioner Dave Owens told the national AAP news agency.

The arrests were made by a special task force set up after a mob of whites attacked people of Arab appearance at south Sydney's Cronulla beach on Sunday, sparking days of retaliatory attacks by mainly ethnic-Lebanese men.

Police used new powers granted by an emergency session of the New South Wales parliament Thursday, after lawmakers were recalled from their summer recess.

The legislation gives police powers to "lock down" suburbs, close pubs, enforce alcohol bans and confiscate cars.

The overnight display of force came ahead of an expected major clampdown at the weekend, when police will treble their numbers to up to 1,500 officers at troubled beaches and suburbs.

Prime Minister John Howard, writing in Australia's Daily Telegraph Friday, said the violence was a result of people who had "no regard for the law" and those who had "no respect for their fellow Australians".

"It is clear the best way to deal with the challenge is for everyone to calm down," wrote Howard, who has dismissed suggestions that Australia is a racist society.

"The most immediate -- and best -- solution is maintenance of law and order."

Despite the attacks, the overwhelming majority of Australians still had "the proper instincts and decent values", he said.

"In the long term we can reflect on whether there are some lessons to be learned or messages to be heeded," he said of the events of the past week.

Meanwhile, the prime minister encouraged Australians to enjoy the holiday season. "Let us celebrate Christmas and the long days of summer," Howard wrote.

"Celebrate the fact Australia is still the greatest place in the world to live."
