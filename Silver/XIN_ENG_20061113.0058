Thailand's medal hopes at the 15th Doha Asian Games have been boosted as their tennis number one Paradorn Srichaphan has confirmed his intention to compete in the December 1-15 Asian sports jamboree, as the Doha Asian Games official website revealed on Sunday.

With an exhausting schedule and wrist problems, there had been doubts whether Srichaphan would be able to defend the men's singles title he won four years ago in Busan, South Korea.

But following an excellent run of form in recent months at ATP tour, the 27-year-old China Open semifinalist will take to the courts at the tennis in Doha.

Although now not officially recognized as Asia's top player, according the ATP rankings, which places South Korea's Lee Hyung Taik at number 49, four places above Srichaphan, the Thai is still likely to start as favourite.

He won both two previous meetings against Lee, whom he defeated to win the title of the men's singles at Busan Games in 2002.
