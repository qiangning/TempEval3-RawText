The murder trial of four suspects accused of killing a world-renowned British environmentalist and wildlife filmmaker in her bed in Kenya earlier this year opened in Naivasha on Friday.

David Chege, Joseph Ndung'u, Philip Mutuku and Allan Githenji face charges of murdering and attempting to rob Joan Wells Root, 69, the daughter of a colonial-era British settler, in the Kenyan Rift Valley where she was raised and lived for many years promoting environmental causes.

The guardsman on duty during the January 13 incident in Naivasha, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of Nairobi, told magistrate Nicholas Njagi that none of the men on trial were among those he witnessed killing the filmmaker.

According to the guard, Abdi Aziz Diba, two men carrying a gun and a machete approached Root's home before midnight in an attempt to rob the daughter of coffee farmer and photo safari guide Edmund Thorpe of 57,500 US dollars (43,600 euros).

Root was well known for her conservation efforts and kept several species of animals, including waterbucks, dik diks and birds, on her compound where hippos were known to gather, residents said.

With her ex-husband, Alan, she made several acclaimed nature documentaries in the 1960s, 70s and 80s including "Balloon Safari", in which they used innovative aerial techniques to capture Kenya's stunning wildlife and landscape.

Naivasha has been rife with animosity between foreign investors, mainly flower farmers, and the local population over access to resources, and has been the scene of several violent attacks on European residents, although Root's murder is the first in several months.

At least three other Europeans have been slain in violent robberies in the Rift Valley since September 2004, prompting great unease and major security fears in the expatriate community.

The magistrate adjourned the trial until January 23 next year.
