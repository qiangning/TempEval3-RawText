Pope John Paul II arrived in Prague Friday afternoon for a three-day visit to a country which has largely eschewed God for materialism in its post-Communist daily life.

Met at Ruzyne airport by Czech President Vaclav Havel and Havel's former-actress wife, Dagmar, the pontiff said the head of state was "one of great artists in the renaissance of this country."

It is the pope's third trip to Prague. The first time, in 1990, half-a-million people greeted him for his first visit to an eastern European capital after the 1989 collapse of Communism.

In 1995, however, he was mostly met with indifference by the country's 10.5 million inhabitants, half of whom are atheist.

Apparently remembering that, the pope said Friday that he hoped the spiritual motive of his current visit would "find an echo in people who, for different reasons, consider themselves distant from the Church and from religion."

The pope will hold a non-denominational service Sunday for non- Catholic Christians.

In his welcome, Havel raised the modern challenges faced by the Czech Republic since the end of Communism.

"Today we have the chance to live in a country where, unlike other parts of our continent, evil doesn't take a brutal and tragic form. But there are other menaces, more subtle, and perhaps even more dangerous, facing our civilisation. Together and separately we must confront these, and we haven't yet shown ourselves to be very capable," he said.

The two men also paid hommage to St Adalbert, a bishop of Prague martyred in 997 and the patron saint of Poland. The 1,000-year celebration of the saint is one of the main reasons for the pope's visit.

On arriving in Prague itself, the pontiff was greeted by the ringing of the city's church bells. After the official welcoming ceremony, he headed to the Breznov monastery where his bullet-proof "Popemobile" awaited him. From there he was taken to a religious residence in the city centre where he will stay during his visit.

The pope's message is expected to focus on denouncing western habits largely adopted here and on downplaying the centuries-old schism between the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox church.

The Czech Catholic church for its part is facing its own identity crisis as it tries to find its place in a heavily secular society. It is also smarting from a year-old scandal at the Prague school of theology which was accused of employing teachers suspected of having collaborated with the communist era secret police.

Pope John Paul is likely to stress the importance of both churches working together and to reject fiery accusations against the Vatican, mainly by the Greek Orthodox Church, of proselytism.

Before the service late Sunday commemorating St Adalbert, the pope will hold two other ceremonies: a mass Saturday in front of 50,000 young people, and another Sunday which is expected to attract 120,000 faithful.

Nationwide, only 50,000 people attend church.
