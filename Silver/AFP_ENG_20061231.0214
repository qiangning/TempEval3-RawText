New Year's Eve fireworks displays, concerts and other outdoor parties were scrapped on Sunday in several British cities amid security fears over heavy storms, disappointing tens of thousands of revelers.

Celebrations overnight Sunday in the Northern Irish capital of Belfast and the Scottish city of Glasgow as well as the northern English cities of Newcastle and Liverpool were all canceled because of the bad weather.

Up to 10,000 people had been due to watch soul singer Beverley Knight and rock band The Thrills in the streets outside Belfast's City Hall, but the city council called off the events for safety reasons.

Officials in Glasgow dropped plans for a massive outdoor street party in central George Square where around 25,000 people had been expected to dance and sing along with Fratellis and Sandi Thom as well as watch a fireworks show.

With high winds and rain forecast, a spokesman for Glasgow City Council urged partygoers to stay away from the Hogmanay or New Year's party, traditionally the biggest event in the Scottish calendar.

A pyrotechnics extravaganza in Newcastle, the culmination of the city's month-long Winter Festival, was also dropped.

"Obviously the safety of the public comes first," said Newcastle councillor Pauline Allen.

Fireworks planned for Liverpool's St George's Plateau were called off and the event will now take place on Friday, January 5.

New Year's fireworks displays in the British capital London were still planned, according to Mayor Ken Livingstone.

London's New Year's Day Parade of marching bands, clowns, vintage cars, traction engines and carnival queens -- expected to attract up to 400,000 spectators -- will definitely go ahead, organizers added.

Forecasters said gusts of up to 80 miles (130 kilometres) per hour were expected off the coast of Cumbria, northwest England.

Days of fierce storms have already caused a number of casualties. An 18-year-old woman died and her two 19-year-old friends were injured when a tree crashed onto a mobile home in Staffordshire on Saturday.
