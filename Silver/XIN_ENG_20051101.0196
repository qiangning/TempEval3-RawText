Kenya's flag carrier Kenya Airways has announced it will introduce larger aircraft daily from Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa except Thursdays and Sundays from next week.

The airline said in a statement here Tuesday that it had put measures in place to cater for the capacity demand on its domestic operations to bolster domestic tourism.

Kenya Airways Head of Marketing and Corporate Communications Michael Okwiri said that passengers would from Nov. 7 fly aboard the larger Boeing 767, which has 216 seats compared to the regular 737 that has 116 seats on the early morning flights, an 86 percent increase in capacity on these key early flights.

Okwiri said the new development has been occasioned by numerous conferences in Mombasa which he said would develop domestic travel.

"The local tourism scene has seen phenomenal growth in the last couple of months and we want to support this route," he said.

The increase in the number of international visitors to Kenya has spurred a greater interest in the tourism sector with the airports registering the highest number of traffic in the last five years.
