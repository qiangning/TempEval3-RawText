Australian investment group Macquarie Bank made a formal cash offer of 580 pence per share for the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, valuing the LSE at about 1.5 billion pounds (2.2 billion euros, 2.7 billion dollars).

Last week, the LSE had rejected an informal offer from Macquarie Bank which valued the stock market operator at 1.48 billion pounds, describing it as "derisory".

Thursday's offer was made before a December 15 deadline set by the British Takeover Panel for Macquarie Bank to make a formal bid or walk away.

Macquarie said that if its bid succeeded, the LSE would continue to be regulated solely by the Financial Services Authority. The exchange would continue to be managed in London.

The Australian group said one week ago that it had approached the LSE, the biggest equity market in Europe, over bid talks and indicated that it would be prepared to offer 580 pence per share in cash.
