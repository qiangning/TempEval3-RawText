Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri has said that the outcome of recent elections in the United States would not affect Pakistan-U.S. relations.

In an interview with state-run Pakistan Television (PTV) on Friday, the foreign minister said Pakistan enjoyed special relations with the United States whose policy toward Pakistan had bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress.

He said that the policy of both the parties, the Republicans and Democrats, was based on the 9/11 Commission Report, which stressed the centrality and importance of Pakistan for regional and international peace and security.

He added the new Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and other leaders of Democratic Party during their election campaign had stressed the necessity of faithful implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.

"This ensured continuing support to Pakistan," said Kasuri.

Kasuri said due to its strategic location and the vital role it played in regional peace and security, Pakistan remained an important country not just for the United States but also for the European Union, China, Russia, Japan, the Islamic World as well as other countries of the world.

He added that Pakistan was following a policy of constant engagement with important countries. It was, therefore, immaterial who controlled the U.S. Congress, he said.

Kasuri said the numerous Congressional delegations that visited Pakistan and with whom he interacted, contained top leaders from both the parties.

He said former U.S. President Clinton, the best known leader of the Democratic Party, had recently invited President Musharraf to attend Clinton Global Initiative in New York where he was the only leader from Asia.

This was indicative of importance of Pakistan and of President Musharraf in the eyes of leaders of both Republican and Democratic parties, he said.

On the recent visit of the U.S. Assistance Secretary of State Richard Boucher, Kasuri categorically denied the reports that he carried a secret message to Pakistan.

He rubbished the reports that any country could dictate to Pakistan. The foreign minister stressed that Pakistan did what it found to be in its best national interest.
