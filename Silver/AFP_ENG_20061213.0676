A weapons buyback in Australia dramatically ended gun massacres and sharply reduced the number of firearms deaths overall, a study published on Thursday says.

The initiative was launched in 1996, within days of a massacre of 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, by a gunman using semi-automatic weapons.

Under the new law, the federal government banned semi-automatics and pump-action rifles and shotguns and offered to buy these weapons from gunowners, using a levy on income tax.

Tens of thousands of gunowners also voluntarily surrendered non-prohibited weapons, without compensation.

In all, more than 700,000 guns were destroyed in a country with a population of 12 million adults.

Looking back at the effects that this measure has had over the past decade, Australian public-health experts say the benefits have been enormous.

In the 18 years prior to the Port Arthur massacre, Australia experienced 13 mass shootings; there has been none since then, they say.

The rate of homicides, suicides and fatal accidents involving firearms had been declining in the 18 years preceding the new gun law.

After that, the decline doubled, with the biggest fall occurring among the tally of suicides.

"Removing large numbers of firearms from a community can be associated with a sudden and ongoing decline in mass shootings and accelerating declines in total firearm-related deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides," says the paper.
