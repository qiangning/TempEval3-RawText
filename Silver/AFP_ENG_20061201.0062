Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday for talks on trade links, officials said.

"The priority in negotiations will be questions of increasing the turnover and diversification of trade cooperation," a Kremlin official said ahead of the meeting.

Trade turnover between the two countries rose from 366.3 million dollars (276 million euros) in 2004 to 551.2 million dollars in 2005 and amounted to 300.9 million dollars in the first half of 2006, the official said.

Ten documents are set to be signed during Yudhoyono's visit, the Kremlin official said, including cooperation in nuclear energy, space technology, arms sales and tourism.

The Kommersant daily cited officials as saying that Indonesia intends to buy Russian arms, mainly submarines and fighter jets, and will be given one billion dollars (755 million euros) in credit to do this.

"The most important document is set to be an agreement on the development of military technical cooperation for 2007-2010," Kommersant said, adding that Indonesia was particularly interested in buying two Amur submarines.

Yudhoyono was impressed by the Russian military technology he saw on display at the Indo Defence 2006 arms fair that took place in Jakarta last week, Kommersant said.

Indonesia, once a major purchaser of Soviet weaponry, bought fighter jets, military helicopters, armoured personnel carriers and Kalashnikov assault rifles in 2003, Kommersant added.

Indonesia and Russia will also sign an agreement for Russian energy firms Gazprom and Lukoil to take part in oil and gas projects on the island of Borneo and for Russia to build Indonesia's first nuclear reactor, Kommersant said.

Yudhoyono has already visited the northern Russian city of Saint Petersburg during his visit and on Friday is set to address a business forum and receive an honorary diploma from a Russian foreign ministry academy.
