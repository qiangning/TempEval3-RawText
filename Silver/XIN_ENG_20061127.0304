UN agencies have asked the World Heritage Committee (WHC) to investigate whether Victoria Falls should remain on the World Heritage list following revelations that Zambia has approved the construction of 500 chalets in the rainforest, local newspapers said on Monday.

According to regulations of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Conservation Union, the construction of the chalets would negatively impact on the natural state of the rainforest, The Herald said.

After a three-day consultative meeting with the Zambian and Zimbabwean officials, the deputy director of the World Heritage Center in Paris Kishore Rao said the joint consultative meetings were meant to improve conservation programs on both sides of the rainforest.

He said his delegation was looking at various aspects that included tourism regulations and infrastructural development within the rainforest.

He said some of the infrastructural developments were a threat to the site. "We are here to assess the state of the site in terms of the rules and regulations governing the world heritage sites. The regulations are meant to improve the state of conservation and there are specific regulations that we want to see being implemented," he added.

"Some infrastructural developments are a threat to the site and we are making assessments on the both sides of the site," he said.

Rao said the results on whether or not to de-list the site as a World Heritage Site would only be known after a WHC meeting in June next year.

Rao was, however, reluctant to comment on the variance between Livingstone and Victoria Falls in terms of meeting the requirements of WHC. "We are now leaving for Lusaka where we intend to meet government officials there as some of the decisions might be political. So it will be premature if I am to say anything concerning the delisting of the site," he said.

On Wednesday, the commission visited a refuse dumpsite at the Helipad, and on the Zambian side they visited the proposed site of the 500 chalets.
