The German foreign ministry on Wednesday said it would not make a statement before "verifying" Iran's decision not to allow the German and Danish ambassadors to return to Tehran.

"It is too early for a reaction," said ministry spokesman Horst Freitag. "We are trying to clear up the situation."

He would not say whether German authorities had contacted Tehran to discuss the matter.

The ambassadors, plus counterparts from other EU countries, were withdrawn after a German court ruled that senior Iranian officials were involved in the 1992 murder of four Iranian Kurds in a Berlin restaurant.

Iran earlier said it was halting all dialogue with the European Union. It also ruled out the early return of German and Danish ambassadors in retaliation for the EU's latest measures against the Islamic republic.

The foreign ministry announced in a statement that it would break off "all talks on human rights, terrorism and arms control."

On Tuesday, EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg banned ministerial visits to or from Iran over Tehran's alleged involvement in the 1992 killings.

In Paris, foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said EU governments were holding discussion on how to react to Iran's decision.

He said that in principle the ambassadors should "return normally to their posts."

"If they are being labelled persona non grata, that is something else," he added.
