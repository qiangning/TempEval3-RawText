Hong Kong democracy leader Martin Lee scoffed at draft regulations Wednesday that would bar Hong Kong politicians from accepting funds from abroad after the territory reverts to China in July.

Hong Kong's pro-China leader in waiting, Tung Chee-hwa, "is really the guilty party in this regard," Lee, in Washington as part of a 15-stop North American speaking and fundraising tour, told reporters here.

Lee also rejected any link between suspected Chinese efforts to funnel illicit donations last year to US congressional campaigns -- allegedly to influence US China policy -- and his own foreign fundraising for the Hong Kong Democratic Party.

Hong Kong's future government, unlike the US Congress, "will have no say in defense and foreign affairs," Lee said, noting that his party will have no role in government after Beijing regains control of Hong Kong on July 1.

"They are so afraid of us ... because we have the support of the people of Hong Kong," the Democratic Party leader said. "They will do anything to stop us."

Lee estimated that his own foreign fundraising efforts since March in Canada and the United States had netted 2.5 million Hong Kong dollars (about 320,000 dollars US).

In Hong Kong, Tung's office issued a "consultation document" arguing that Hong Kong faced a legal vacuum after the July 1 handover and was "extremely vulnerable to external forces" that required firm laws.

The paper proposed barring local political groups from "financial assistance or loans of any kind" from any alien or foreign organization, a reference that includes Taiwan individuals and groups, it said.

It also proposed empowering the government to outlaw parties based on national security considerations and the police to bar political ralllies.
