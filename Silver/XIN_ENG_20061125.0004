Mexican defender Rafael Marquez, who plays for Spanish league soccer team Barcelona, became a Spanish citizen on Friday, with a public ceremony where he swore an oath to Spain's constitution, and freed a place on his team for another player from outside the European Union.

Marquez joined Barcelona in 2003, leaving French league team Monaco. He took the oath, which is the last part of the Spanish nationalization process, first thing in the morning in Gava, the Barcelona neighborhood where he lives.

With Marquez's nationalization Barcelona now has only two officially foreign players - Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o and Brazil's Ronaldo de Assis, better known as Ronaldinho.

If the club decided to make use of the winter transfer market, it will now have a much larger choice of players.
