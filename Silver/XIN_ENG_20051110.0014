Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Thursday condemned the bomb attacks on three hotels in Jordan in which at least 57 people were killed and up to 300 wounded.

Howard said the attacks showed that terrorists had no regard for their victims, in this case mainly Muslim Jordanians.

"We have to again remind ourselves that terrorism is the enemy of all civilized societies," he told Sky News television.

"This was carried out in an Islamic country, the target, albeit three hotels frequented by westerners," he said.

"It's indiscriminate. It just shows that nobody can assume that they're immune," he said.

Meanwhile, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer " unequivocally" condemned the bombings, which he described as " appalling."

"This was a cowardly and indiscriminate attack on innocent people as they were going about their lives peacefully in Amman," he said in a statement.

"It reminds us yet again that terrorism remains a serious threat,and that no country is immune," he said.

"And it underlines the importance of strong international cooperation in the fight against terror," he said.

"I extend my deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those killed and to those injured in this despicable act," he said.
