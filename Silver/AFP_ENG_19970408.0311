Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy arrived here Tuesday for cooperation talks with Turkish leaders, including a meeting with Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who opposes close ties with the Jewish state.

This is the first high-level political visit between the two states since Erbakan and Israel's hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in their respective countries last year.

Turkey and Israel, whose relations remained dormant during decades of the Arab-Israeli conflict, boosted their ties to a strategic level last year.

They signed two major pacts on military and defense industry cooperation despite condemnation by radical states such as Iran, Syria and Iraq.

But the boost in military relations could not be matched in political ties, as Erbakan has still not responded to an invitation by Netanyahu to visit Israel.

Levy said in interviews with Turkish newspapers last week that his visit would be aimed at cementing political cooperation.

Diplomats here said Erbakan accepted Levy's request for a meeting at the last minute.

A 630 million dollar agreement under which Israeli Aircraft Industries will upgrade Turkey's aging fleet of 54 F-4E Phantom aircraft took effect last November, the largest-scale defense industry deal between the two countries.

In Turkey, Levy will also meet President Suleymen Demirel, Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, Chief of the General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi and business circles.

The Turkish parliament last Friday approved a free trade agreement signed last year.

With the agreement, the two countries hope to bolster their trade relations, which currently register an annual two-way volume of nearly 500 million dollars.
