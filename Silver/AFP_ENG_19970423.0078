A surge on Wall Street triggered a wave of buying across Asia on Wednesday, with some markets also benefitting from favourable domestic data while others reported mild profit taking.

Wall Street on Tuesday experienced its second largest point gain on record following the release of better-than-expected quarterly corporate results.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 173.38 points, or 2.6 percent, to 6,833.59. The record was set October 21, 1987 when the Dow soared 186.84 points.

The surge pulled up bourses in Sydney, Hong Kong and Jakarta while improving sentiment in Tokyo. Most other stock markets in the region benefitted largely from bargain hunting on domestic factors, brokers said.

Japanese share prices closed 1.0 percent higher with the key barometer of the Tokyo Stock Exchange up 191.02 points at 18,735.47, due to strong underlying sentiment, brokers said.

"The market was heartened by the rally on Wall Street as well as the yen's continued weakness of the dollar," said Yasuo Ueki, a broker at Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.

Hong Kong share prices were up 1.3 percent in morning trade following the Wall Street gains, with the key Hang Seng Index gaining 165.95 points to close the morning session at 12,746.80.

Herman Chu, senior dealing manager at Anglo Chinese Securities, said "there was strong buying following Wall Street's sharp rise," adding that the index came off its highs as it approached resistance at 12,800 points.

"This is seen as a very strong resistance level and it's not good to push any more at the moment. If I were an investor I would be taking short-term profit at these levels," he said.

Chu said attention would probably switch to blue chips after the next US Federal Reserve Board meeting in late May, which would remove much of the interest rate uncertainty overhanging the market.

In Jakarta, the stock exchange index rose 3.70 points to close morning trade at 649.95 points.

"We seem to be getting a bit of a run on the back of New York," a sales representative with a Japanese brokerage said, adding that people were hunting for bargains among some stocks.

Australian share prices rose 1.0 percent due to the Wall Street rally, the release of data showing a four-year low inflation rate and an agreement on moderate wage rises for much of the country's workforce, brokers said.

The Australian Stock Exchange's main indicator, the all ordinaries index, closed 23.8 points up at 2,471.4.

The inflation data and wages deal "points the market to feeling better about the possibility the Reserve Bank could shave interest rates," said Grant Williams, broker at Reynolds and Co.

Share prices in other regional bourses rallied mostly on technical factors, brokers said.

Stock market indices closed 0.7 percent higher in Seoul and 1.9 percent firmer in Manila on technical factors and ended 1.7 percent up in Taipei due to high hopes for dividend payouts from eletrical issues, brokers said.

In Bangkok, the key SET index was up just 0.05 point at 691.21 at the end of morning trade with investors sidelined ahead of key monthly economic data due for release Thursday, brokers said.

Among the losers, Singapore's blue-chip share index closed 0.1 percent lower at midday Wednesday on profit-taking but bargain-hunting on selected stocks capped overall falls.

Malaysia's stock market benchmark, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's 100-share weighted composite index, shed 5.48 points to 1,115.02 in early trade.

Dealers said the US rally had litle impact on the Malaysian market which was depressed due to rumours of a cabinet reshuffle and reports of a rift between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and a Malay ruler.
