Sao Tome and Principe's Parliament on Thursday voted against holding of a constitutional referendum on the country's system of power sharing, a national consultation wanted by President Fradique de Menezes.

According to reports reaching here, a motion to reject the referendum, originally agreed for next year by parliament and the president in 2003, was supported by 45 parliament members and opposed by only five members of the 55-seat legislature.

The Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP) , the archipelago's biggest party, publicly distanced itself last month from the planned referendum, aimed to formalize the respective weighting of sovereign bodies in the islands' semi- presidential system.

MLSTP leader Guilherme Posser da Costa is widely expected to challenge President Menezes' bid for a second term in office next year. Local and parliamentary elections are also expected in 2006.
