Roundup: Macao on high alert over bird flu

by Zhang Ning

MACAO, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao is on high alert over the bird flu epidemic fear, as the body temperature scanning at border checkpoints was resumed Friday.

The anti-bird flu temperature screening covers all border checkpoints including the Macao-Zhuhai Barrier Gate, linking the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai.

The fever check, initiated during the SARS crisis in 2003, is meanwhile continuing at the Macao International Airport.

Xinhua reporter Friday witnessed a squad of technicians from the Macao Health Bureau (MHB) on watch of travelers through two image systems at the arrival hall of the Macao-Zhuhai Barrier Gate.

MHB technicians said they started the surveillance mission Thursday to monitor the body temperature of all Macao residents and visitors.

The systems automatically read all travelers' body temperature when they pass through.

If the temperature exceeds the standardized 34 to 35 degree Celsius, health inspectors will re-check the travelers and possibly require them to undergo more follow-up health checks at a local hospital.

Meanwhile, Zhuhai's border checkpoint in Gongbei area has started temperature monitoring since Thursday.

All departing passengers are also requested to fill out a form on their health condition at the Gongbei checkpoint.

If passengers are suspected of displaying H5N1 symptoms, they will be banned from leaving Zhuhai.

Foreign and Taiwan passport holders are demanded to fill out the health forms on their arrival to Zhuhai.

Back in Macao, no measures against the import of poultry have been taken yet, Cheung So Mui, vice president of the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau (CMAB), told local media on Friday.

However, the Macao Post Daily quoted the official as saying that the CMAB will continue to pay close attention to the issue of the bird flu epidemic.

Cheung also reportedly said the CMAB is considering ceasing the licenses of a number of poultry hawkers who are running their businesses on the open ground.
