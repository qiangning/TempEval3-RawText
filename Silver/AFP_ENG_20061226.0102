China's economy is expected to grow by 9.5 percent next year, realizing the government's goal of achieving "steady but fast" growth, state media reported Tuesday, citing a top government think tank.

The slowdown from this year's estimated 10.5 percent will be led by a cooling in investment and a less brisk world economy affecting China's exports, the Shanghai Securities News said, citing the State Information Center.

The report forecast the country's export to rise by 15 percent in 2007, about 10 percentage points lower than the figure this year.

The acceleration of fixed-asset investment, which has been fueled by high liquidity and companies' reinvestments of large profits, will ease slightly next year to 20 percent growth as the government keeps tightening, it said.

However, the negative impacts of the slowdown in investment and export growth could be compensated to some extent by rising domestic consumption bolstered by residents' anticipation of rising incomes, the report said.
