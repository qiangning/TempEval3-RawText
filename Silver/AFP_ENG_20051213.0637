The European Union's budget impasse is fueling growing questions about the entire enlargement process barely 18 months after the "big bang" expansion into eastern Europe, officials admit.

EU leaders, meeting at a summit in Brussels from Thursday, will try again to end the dispute over the 2007-2013 spending plans, the first to take into account the 10 newest members.

But two old issues are still blocking accord: Britain;s refusal to give up its annual budget rebate, dating from 1984 and France's refusal to cut the bloc's long-disputed farm subsidy system.

The question increasingly debated in the EU corridors of power is, if the EU can't even overcome these two key issues with 25 member states, how on earth can it expect to resolve them with even more?

"Everyone knows that the European Union does not yet have the solutions to respond to the challenges posed by the enlargement already underway," French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said on Monday.

"The problem is knowing whether we should launch a new wave of enlargement."

Only last year the expanding Europe's future had seemed so rosy.

Ten countries, many of them former communist states from central and eastern Europe, joined the then 15-member EU in great fanfare in its biggest-ever expansion on May 1, 2004.

But that euphoria gave way to despair just over a year later, after voters in France and the Netherlands rejected the Union's painstakingly prepared constitution and plunged it into its deepest political crisis.

Part of the reason for the "no" vote, was the perceived threat among the public of foreign workers or immigrants flooding into a Europe ill-prepared to absorb more member states, most of them poor by comparison.

Once publicly voiced, those doubts about enlargement gained momentum and have surfaced again as the Union approaches a second major summit still struggling to resolve its financial problems.

The budget is worth more than 800 billion euros (944 billion dollars) and contains much-needed funds for the EU's relatively poor new members from further east.

In London on Friday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that if a deal is not done soon it would leave the last lot of EU newcomers with a vast shortfall in funds and could threaten expansion.

"It would cast a real shadow, not just over the European Union, but over the future of enlargement too," said Blair, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency until the end of the month.

Romania and Bulgaria are scheduled to join the EU in January 2007, but Macedonia may become the first casualty of the budget dispute.

The tiny Balkan state had hoped to be given the official status of a candidate for EU membership this week, especially given the pace of its drive on reform since the end of an ethnic Albanian uprising in 2001.

"Macedonia is in danger of becoming a little victim of circumstances, but we are going to try to make sure that it is as small a victim as possible," said one European official on condition of anonymity.

France is its most vocal opponent.

"We asked ourselves if the conditions are right today, in December 2005, to officially give Macedonia the status of a candidate. Is this the right time to choose?" Douste-Blazy said at a meeting of EU foreign ministers.

"Granting candidate status like that would send a strong political signal to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which is positive, but it would also send a signal to the public... that we are heading for more enlargement."

A concrete sign of the malaise and the EU's ability to integrate more members was inscribed in the ministers' conclusions, which called for further discussion on enlargement in 2006.

When asked if France would block Macedonia's candidacy status, Douste-Blazy said: "President (Jacques) Chirac will speak about it when the time is right."
