Iran's main opposition group called Monday for a boycott of next month's presidential elections in Iran, calling it an "illegitimate mascarade."

The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) said that "this vote, like all the other mascarades of this theocracy, is completely illegitimate," according to a statement received by AFP in Nicosia.

Massud Radjavi, head of the Paris-based NCRI and chief of the armed opposition group People's Mujahedeen, called the May 23 polls a "political funeral and the inevitable sweeping aside" of outgoing president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

"This event is the most import schism that will affect the regime in its terminal stage," he said.
