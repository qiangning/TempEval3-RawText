The Tampa Bay Devil Rays agreed to terms on Friday with Japanese infielder Akinori Iwamura on a three-year contract with a team option for 2010.

Financial terms were not disclosed, but Major League Baseball's website reported Friday that the contract is worth 7.7 million dollars while the fourth-year option would pay 4.25 million dollars.

The move came one day after the Boston Red Sox made international headlines by signing Japanese pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka to a six-year contract reportedly worth 52 million dollars.
