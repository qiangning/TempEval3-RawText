President Bill Clinton Friday assured Hong Kong's Democratic party leader Martin Lee that the United States will defend democratic freedoms in the territory once China takes it over.

The president told Lee during their meeting that "there would be consequences if there are democratic erosions" after the July 1 transition of the British colony to China rule, White House spokesman Michael McCurry said.

Lee, Hong Kong's chief China critic, said Clinton gave him a warm reception despite a White House decision to downgrade the meeting to a "drop-by."

"I have no doubt at all after this meeting ... that the US government will defend Hong Kong's freedoms," Lee said following his 25-minute talks with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.

He said Clinton supported his view that the 1984 Joint Declaration between Britain and China was an "international agreement," a stand likely to irk China which insists it is a domestic matter that US leaders should stay out of.

McCurry said Clinton also shared Lee's concerns about the replacement of Hong Kong's elected legislature with a China-appointed body, calling it "contrary to the commitments" of the agreement on the transition.

Lee said he asked Clinton to extend a White House invitation to Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, which McCurry said was under consideration.

Tung on Wednesday cancelled a US visit reportedly to avoid embarrassment should he be denied a White House meeting.

Friday's talks were specially choreographed to minimize tensions with China, with an official meeting between Gore and Lee which Clinton dropped in on while it was "in progress."

Tung had warned Lee Friday to be careful during his own trip to Washington, saying "please bear in mind that whatever he says it will be carefully read and interpreted. The worst thing is, at this juncture, to give people in the United States a wrong impression."

Lee said he also urged Clinton to extend China's Most Favored Nation trade status again this year, saying that revoking the benefits would hurt Hong Kong the more than Beijing.

Though the US administration has been issuing daily warnings about preserving democracy in Hong Kong, it has not threatened any concrete measures should China go ahead with plans to crack down on freedoms of expression and assembly.

McCurry acknowledged the US threats were mostly lip service but defended the method.

"A large measure of it is just jawboning but that's important to the Chinese leadership," he said.

He pointed to this week's mammoth effort by Beijing to block a UN resolution on condemning China's human rights record, saying: "They clearly are sensitive to those in the international community who raised concerns."

As part of the US vigilance over the handover, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will attend the ceremony in Hong Kong, where there are 40,000 American citizens and some 13 billion dollars in investments.
