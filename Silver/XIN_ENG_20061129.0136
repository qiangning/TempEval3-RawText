The Philippine government announced the suspension of classes in all levels Thursday in Metro Manila and nearby provinces of Rizal, Cavite and Laguna, due to the threat of typhoon Durian, local media reported on Wednesday.

The suspension was issued as the typhoon is expected to bring rains and strong winds to Luzon, according to a report by ANC TV.

Weather bureau PAGASA said Durian has intensified further and increased its threat to Luzon. Storm Signal 3 was hoisted over Catanduanes province in the Bicol region, while storm Signals 1 and 2 were also hoisted over 10 other provinces.

Residents in areas under Public Storm Warning Signal 1, 2 and 3 are alerted against possible flashfloods and landslides.

As of 11 a.m. local time, Durian was located 400 kilometers east southeast of Virac, Catanduanes or 360 kilometers east northeast of Catarman, Northern Samar. It was moving west northwest at 26 kilometers per hour (kph) with maximum sustained winds of 150 kph and gustiness of up to 185 kph.
