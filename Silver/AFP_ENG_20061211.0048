Shares in Australian flag carrier Qantas jumped more than four percent Monday amid expectations a takeover consortium is finally ready to formally table a multi-billion dollar offer for the airline.

The consortium, led by Australia's biggest investment bank Macquarie and US-based private equity firm, Texas Pacific Group, has reportedly finalised the debt financing package for the bid.

The Australian Financial Review reported the offer, worth up to 10.9 billion dollars (8.4 billion US), could be unveiled as early as Tuesday, more than three weeks after Qantas revealed the initial approach.

After intense speculation about the bid's structure, Bell Potter private client advisor Stuart Smith said the market responded positively to the prospect of seeing details.

Qantas shares closed up 21 cents or 4.2 percent to 5.26 dollars on the Australian Stock Exchange after briefly hitting a record intra-day high of 5.30 dollars.

Macquarie Bank closed up 1.30 at 73.10 dollars.

The Australian Financial Review, citing unnamed sources, said the bid would be pitched at more than 5.50 dollars a Qantas share.

It said Macquarie and Texas Pacific planned to sell bonds backed by Qantas' fleet of 217 planes to finance more than half the debt incurred if the bid proceeds.

The newspaper said Canberra was struggling to formulate a policy to deal with the bid, torn between its commitment to free-market economics and protecting a national icon.

Government backbencher Bruce Baird said the value of protectionist measures designed to shore up Qantas' position against rivals such as Singapore Airlines and Emirates would be questioned if the bid was successful.

"I'm sure the protection it has got from Singapore Airlines is one of the things that makes it attractive. Maybe we have fatted the calf too much for market day," he said.

The government has ruled out changing the law to prevent Qantas being broken up and says it will maintain rules limiting overall foreign ownership of the airline at 49 percent and capping single stakes available to foreign firms at 25 percent.

But Baird signalled other trade barriers protecting Qantas could be up for review if a takeover meant the airline became "just another multinational organisation".

Singapore Airlines vice-president TK Mun said over the weekend that the airline remained keen to complete with Qantas on the lucrative Australia-US route even though Canberra rejected its application earlier this year.

Mun said Singapore Airlines was closely watching the takeover bid and potential implications for the trans-Pacific route.

"The subject is very much alive; nothing is forever," Mun told Australian Associated Press.

Qantas earlier this month said it expected profits to lift up to 30 percent in the 2006/07 financial year if fuel prices remain near current levels.
