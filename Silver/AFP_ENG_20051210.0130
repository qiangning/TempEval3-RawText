Cote d'Ivoire press on Saturday reported they had been handed a rough deal by the World Cup draw in Leipzig.

Fraternite Matin newspaper said: "The Cote d'Ivoire are in the toughest group," while headlines in dailies Le Jour Plus and Le Patriot read "The Elephants are in the Group of Death."

Le Jour Plus said Cote d'Ivoire were up against it against "top drawer opponents" in twice World Cup winners Argentina, twice World Cup finalists Holland and Serbia-Montenegro in Group C.

The paper noted Cote d'Ivoire played Argentina in 1992 in the Confederations Cup and were thrashed 5-2.

Le Nouveau Reveil reported that the Elephants were in a "complicated" group for their first World Cup finals.

24 Heures said that the hands of football legends Johan Cruyff, Lothar Matthaus, and Roger Milla, who were involved in doing Friday's draw, had not been kind to Cote d'Ivoire who were in the worst position of the five African nations at next year's finals in Germany.

"But do we have to despair?" asked the newspaper who set an optimistic tone that perhaps Henri Michel's players might just again surprise the world as they had done by qualifying for the tournament.

Nord Sud set a similarly optimistic tone, suggesting there were "glorious uncertainties in football" although they did admit they had not been fortunate with the draw.
