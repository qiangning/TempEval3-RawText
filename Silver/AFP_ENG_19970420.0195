The red carpet welcome accorded to North Koreas's top defecter Hwang Jang-Yop on his arrival in the South Sunday provides hints about how he will spend the months to come, analysts said here.

Unlike most defector arrivals, which routinely degenerate into fights between TV cameramen and security officers for access to the dazed, ill-dressed North Koreans, Hwang, the North's top ideologue, could have been a foreign minister.

Dressed in an impeccable three-piece dark suit, he waved elder- statesmanlike from the top of the red-carpeted stairs drawn up to his Air Philippines flight, after Philippine military officials had disembarked.

The greying 74-year-old author of the North's failed Juche (self- reliance) ideology was then escorted with bows to the VIP lounge of the military airport, presented with bouquets of flowers, and offered the microphone.

With whirring TV cameras sending his message live nationwide, he soberly thanked his hosts for helping him in his "quest" -- a mission to seek peace between the North and the South.

The few questions shouted by a tightly-controlled journalists' pool, were quickly silenced by security men, but only after the dapperly- dressed Hwang had told them he considered himself a seeker of peace, not a defector.

Then, speech over, instead of being bundled into a bus -- the usual fate of defectors -- Hwang entered a sleek black limousine to ride in convoy with motorcycle outriders to an unknown destination.

An ambulance followed.

Yonhap News Agency said Hwang was expected to be invited to meet with South Korean President Kim Young-Sam at the presidential Blue House, but gave no date, details and no sources for its report.

Security sources said that under the agreement hammered out with China where he defected on February 12, Hwang would remain incommunicado, probably for a month or more, in a safehouse somewhere in Seoul.

Security was a top priority, they said, an obvious reference to attempts by armed North Korean agents' attempts to recapture Hwang in Beijing, and to sometimes lethal attacks by agents here against defectors in the South.

Hwang's bullet-proof vest showed as he climbed into his limousine.

Reports, repeatedly denied by the top intelligence Agency for National Security Planning (NSPA), that Hwang was carrying "a list" of North Korean agents in the South ratchetted up concerns for his safety.

The NSPA and foreign ministry officials have said Hwang has so far devoted the 67 days since his defection -- a month in Beijing and another month in a secret hideout in the Philippines -- to writing, reading, walking and worrying about his family.

He slept a scant four hours a night, ate frugal meals and no breakfast, and -- fluent in Russian and Japanese -- kept up with the news and preferred to read children's fairy stories before sleeping, they said.
