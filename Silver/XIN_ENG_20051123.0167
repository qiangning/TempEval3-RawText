Political figures in China and Japan should make more efforts to turn China-Japan relationship to the track of healthy and stable development, Chinese State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan said here Wednesday.

Tang made the remarks when meeting with a delegation of young parliamentary members of Japan's Komei Party, led by Ueda Osamu, director of the International Bureau of the party.

Tang spoke highly of the Komei Party's long-term efforts to promoting China-Japan friendly cooperation, and briefed the guests on China's stance on current bilateral relations.

At present, political figures of both countries should more firmly abide by the principle of taking history as a mirror and facing toward the future, and properly handle historical issues with a right attitude, in an effort to push forward China-Japan relationship and return it to the track of healthy and stable development, Tang said.

Tang expressed the hope that young political figures of the Komei Party carry forward the tradition of friendship, actively make pragmatic exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and contribute more to the improvement and development of China-Japan relations.

Ueda Osamu said the Komei Party always upholds the strong desire to promote Japan-China friendship, noting that the Komei Party will continue its efforts to further push forward the friendly ties between the two sides.

Ueda Osamu paid the China visit at the invitation of the China-Japan Friendship Association.
