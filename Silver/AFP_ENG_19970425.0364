Belgian gendarmes have arrested a third paratrooper accused of sadism against Somali people during a multinational operation in the war-torn country in 1993, judicial officials said.

The officer, named as First Sergeant-Major Rudy, was arrested Thursday after allegedly being recognised in a photograph published in the press last week, which showed a Belgian soldier urinating on a wounded Somali.

He had commanded a mortar team at Tielen in Somalia.

The officer was brought back from mission in the Congolese capital Brazzaville and is due to appear before the Brussels Court Martial, which has already charged two other soldiers with sadism.

One of them, accused of badly treating children, has been locked up.

Among other allegations made by former paratroopers was a claim that a young Somali caught stealing food died when he was put in a crate for two days.

Belgian Defence Minister Jean-Pol Poncelet has promised to cashier those responsible and dissolve their whole military unit should the alleged brutality prove to consist of more than isolated incidents.

The soldiers were part of a failed UN-sponsored mission called Operation Restore Hope, which had sought to bring peace and protect food deliveries in Somalia, wracked by clan fighting and starvation.

Foreign troops eventually pulled out without an end to the conflict and after bloody battles with Somali movements.
