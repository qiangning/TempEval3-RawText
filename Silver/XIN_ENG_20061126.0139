A heavy snow storm claimed two lives Sunday at a mountain pass in India-controlled Kashmir, Indo- Asian News Service reported.

Eyewitnesses said two among forty people were swept away by snow storm and killed when they were trying to cross the Zojilla Pass in the Himalaya Mountains, the local police said.

The police sent a team to search the bodies.

The national highway linking the region's winter capital Srinagar to mountainous region Leh has been closed for all vehicular traffic since Nov. 15 due to snowfall but some people chose to walk all the way across the Zojilla Pass.

The local authorities have instructed the police to stop these trekkers as crossing the pass on foot is highly dangerous in the extreme cold weather.
