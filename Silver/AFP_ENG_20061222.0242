The French foreign ministry said that a vote at the UN security council on sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme is unlikely to take place Friday, as originally envisaged.

"The indications which I have lead me to think there will not be a vote today," spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei said.

"We are going to assess the situation to see when the conditions are right (for a vote)," he said.

Divisions remain between the six countries -- the five UN permanent security council members plus Germany -- over the scale of sanctions to impose on the Islamic government in Teheran.
