Canada's Emanuel Sandhu clinched the title of the men's single skating at Cup of China ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating here on Saturday.

Sandhu collected a total of 212.66 points for the win.

Sandhu continued his victory after his home win on Skate Canada International this year. Ranked fourth after short program, he made an error-free performance to the first position.

"I'm very satisfied with my performance today, I don't think I can make it better," said Sandhu.

World champion Stephane Lambiel failed to win gold following two errors, sitting second with 203.60.

Russian Andrei Griazev, winner at Junior Championships last year, settled for the third, earning 200.60 points.

Li Chengjiang, China's medal hopeful, slided from second after short program to eighth after stumbles and falls.

Yao Bin, coach of China's skating team, shook head during Li's performance. "He didn't even give his half best today," said Yao.

Two other gold medals both went to Russia. Irina Slutskaya grabbed the women's singles gold with 196.12 points, while European champion Slutskaya put up a flawless performance to Mario Takes a Walk and got her personal best 196.12, enlarging her gap with rival skaters to nearly 20 points.

"I like all parts of the music," said Slutskaya. "When I was on ice, I felt like I am a flamenco dancer."

World junior champion Mao Asada of Japan also made a brilliant debut at senior figure skating Grand Prix. The 15-year old, who fell on the first jump in the match, managed to recover with clear spins and jumps highlighted with a triple Axels, which gained her a total of 176.60 to stand on the podium.

"I made some mistakes during the competition," said Asada, "but silver medal is a good start, next time I will make it."

Asada's compatriot Shizuka Arakawa, last year's world champion, won the bronze with 173.60.

Also on Saturday, Russian top ice dancing pair Tatiana Navaka/ Roman Kostomarov won the ice dancing title.

The two-time world champions, skating to "Carmen Suite" by G. Bizet, earned continuous cheers from the audience during their routine. The pair held on to their lead in compulsory and original dancing in previous two days, and ended with a total score of 197.07, leaving the runner-up nearly 11 pints behind.

Galit Chait/Sergei Sakhnovski from Israel ended second with 186.14, followed by Canadian Megan Wing/Aaron Lowe with 163.36.
