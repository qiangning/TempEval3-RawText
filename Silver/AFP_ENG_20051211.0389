Lawrence Dallaglio wrote off Wasps's European Cup campaign after the English champions went down to a 21-13 defeat away to Llanelli on Sunday that left his side bottom of Pool Six.

There is still a mathematical chance for the European champions of two seasons ago to make it through to the quarter-finals if they win their remaining three games, including a clash with tournament favourites and reigning champions Toulouse in France.

But after Sunday's match, Dallaglio was adamant Wasps had already scuppered their hopes of reaching the last eight.

"I am very disappointed and very angry with everyone, including myself," the former England back-row forward said

"With the quality in our group it was going to be very difficult but we just weren't good enough today.

"At the moment, one or two are putting it in, and one or two aren't. We got what we deserved today. We are out of Europe yes, and we are desperately disappointed because we want to win trophies."

All six Pool winners and the two best runners-up overall will qualify for the knockout stages of European club rugby union's premier competition.

And at a fog-enshrouded Stradey Park, Llanelli boosted their hopes by moving into second place in the Pool, three points behind Toulouse.

Second-half tries from centre Dafydd James and wing Mark Jones saw the Scarlets on their way to victory, while fly-half Gareth Bowen kicked three penalties and a conversion.

Wasps replied with a Tom Rees try, converted by Mark van Gisbergen, and Alex King landed two penalties for the Londoners but there was no denying Llanelli.

Elswehere, Leicester were forced to overturn a 12-6 half-time deficit at home to Neath-Swansea Ospreys before seeing off the Welsh side 30-12 at Welford Road to go top of Pool Three.

Wales centre Gavin Henson, in his first appearance of the season for the Ospreys since sustaining a groin injury during the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand, was a lively presence in the first-half.

But Leicester rallied and even came away with a bonus point after tries from Brett Deacon, Harry Ellis, George Chuter and Austin Healey.

Henson's fellow Wales centre Sonny Parker and Adrian Cashmore crossed for the Ospreys who were left bottom of the Pool. Like Wasps, they too must win their three remaining games to have any chance of staying in the competition.

Henson, almost as well-known for his distinctive spiky hair and relationship with Welsh singer Charlotte Church as his rugby, courted controversy with a book published after the Lions tour in which he slammed several of his Wales team-mates.

But having come through the full 80 minutes against the Tigers unscathed, Henson said he was happy to be back playing ahead of Six Nations Grand Slam holders Wales's 2005 tournament opener away to England at Twickenham on February 4.

"It is difficult when you have been off the pace. But it's the first time in a year that I've felt no pain in my groin."

There was controversy at Headingley where Leeds only beat French visitors Perpignan 21-20 after fly-half Gordon Ross's re-taken conversion.

He missed with his first effort to goal fellow Scotland international Gordon Bulloch's injury-time try but Welsh referee Nigel Owens ordered a retake because several Perpignan players had charged too early and shouted, both offences, as they tried to block the kick.

Perpignan finished the day on top of Pool Two but were left level on 10 points with Cardiff and only a point ahead of Leeds.

In the day's other match French giants Biarritz thrashed Italy's Treviso 34-7 to top Pool Four ahead of next week's fourth round Pool matches, which will see all this weekend's fixtures reversed.
