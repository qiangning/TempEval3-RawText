China's official Xinhua news agency on Thursday denied that its former Washington bureau chief had killed himself after plans to defect were found out.

"I read the New York Times article about the death of Wei Guoqiang. Their story is ridiculous and baseless," Chen Boliang the head of the agency's foreign affairs department said.

"It could even be said that it is totally made up," he added.

The US newspaper said Wednesday that Wei, 47, had been recalled to Beijing in late March after a colleagues in Washington discovered that he was preparing to ask for political asylum for himself, his wife and his 17-year-old daughter.

Chinese journalists and diplomats are not allowed to leave the country with their children, although sources here say that rule may soon be changed.

Chen conceded that Wei had commited suicide but insisted the death had "nothing to do with poltics."

"He had come back to Beijing before going on to a new post in Singapore," he said. "He was preparing the paperwork for the move, following the course of an absolutely standard transfer.

"Sadly he killed himself at home in the meantime."

The New York Times said Wei had been under close watch at home, but was left briefly alone over the weekend. He then chose that moment to hang himself in the bathroom of his apartment, a colleague was quoted as saying.

Wei held degrees from Beijing's Foreign Languages University and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

A specialist in US affairs, he was appointed Washington bureau chief in early 1996, during an especially stormy period in Sino-American relations.
