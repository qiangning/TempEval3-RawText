Hong Kong share prices opened 0.21 percent lower Tuesday following Wall Street's pullback overnight after the US Federal Reserve warned yet again of inflation risks despite acknowledging that the economy has weakened, dealers said.

The statement, which accompanied the Fed's widely expected decision to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent, is being interpreted to mean that the central bank might raise rates again if inflation accelerates, disappointing investors who had been looking for signals for a rate cut.

The Hang Seng Index opened down 39.50 points at 18,867.67.
