South Africa, the world's largest gold producer, suffers losses as huge as 2 billion rand ( 278 million U.S. dollars) each year due to gold theft from mines, a report revealed on Thursday.

The country's Chamber of Mines said that a report, compiled by the Institute of Security Studies, confirmed that about 1.8 billion rand to 2 billion rand worth of gold is stolen every year.

The report, focusing on the theft of precious metals from South African mines and refineries, also showed that theft of platinum and other precious metals was a problem, the SAPA news agency reported.

The chamber said gold production in South Africa in 2005 was 300 tons, 42 tons less than the 2004 production.

Johannesburg-based newspaper The Star reported on Wednesday that South African police have arrested 60 armed "gold mine pirates" who hijacked gold ores in shafts as deep as 2 kilometers below the surface.
