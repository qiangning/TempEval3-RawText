The UN General Assembly on Monday expressed "strong support" for the Kimberley process, which aims to prevent illegally exported "conflict diamonds" being used to buy arms.

The resolution was adopted by consensus after the 192-member assembly was briefed by Botswana's President Festus Gontebanye Mogae, the current chairman of the UN-mandated Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which requires participants to certify that shipments of rough diamonds are free from conflict diamonds, also known as "blood diamonds".

Under Kimberly, rough diamonds are sealed in tamper-resistant containers and required to have forgery-resistant, conflict-free certificates with unique serial numbers each time they cross an international border.

Seventy-one countries have now signed on to Kimberley and agree to buy and sell only among fellow members. The certificate takes for granted that the stone in question is a real diamond.

The agreement is named after the diamond-mining city in South Africa and went into effect January 1 2003.

The assembly, noting that the trade in conflict diamonds remains "a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fueling of armed conflict ... reaffirms its strong and continuing support for the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and the Kimberley Process as a whole."

The resolution also recognized that the certification can help ensure that UN Security Council resolutions containing sanctions on the trade in conflict diamonds are carried out, while helping to prevent future conflicts.

In his briefing to the assembly, Mogae highlighted a 2006 progress report on the Kimberley Process, which concluded that it was working well although there were still some problems, particularly in Ivory Coast and South America.

Some of Ivory Coast's neighbors are not parties to the Kimberley Process, which has therefore limited influence over them.

"The Kimberley Process views the problem of leakage diamonds from (Ivory Coast) into the legitimate trade as one that may require a regional approach to resolve," the report said.

Trafficking in illegal diamonds is considered one of the root causes of the back-to-back civil wars in Liberia since 1989 as well as of the 10-year brutal conflict in neighboring Sierra Leone that ended in 2001.

A regional approach was also needed in South America, specifically Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela, the report said.

Mogae later told reporters that the Kimberley Process was beginning to have an impact.

"Before the Certification Scheme it was reported that conflict diamonds were possibly about four percent of global production. Now with certification we have admitted in my report that we are glad to say that they are now less than one percent," he said.

Begun in 2000 by southern African diamond-producing countries, the Kimberley Process led to the adoption in November 2002 in Interlaken, Switzerland, of the international Certification Scheme for rough diamonds, based primarily on national certification schemes and on internationally agreed minimum standards.
