South China's Guangdong Province is mulling legislation to ban schools from expelling students during the nine-year compulsory education period.

Poor grades, puppy love or skipping classes will no longer be a sufficient pretext for schools to kick out primary and junior high school students, according to the draft law on juvenile delinquency prevention being deliberated in Guangzhou, the provincial capital.

Though no official figures are available regarding the percentage of students expelled, it is common knowledge that some Chinese schools kick out children with poor grades in order to improve their performance and compete more successfully with other schools, said Wang Xudong, an official with the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, the provincial legislature.

If a school wants to expel a child for consistently bad behavior, it will have to file records with the local education authority within 15 days of the date of dismissal, according to Wang.

"The legislation will prevent schools from giving up too soon on unruly students, and help decrease juvenile delinquency," said Xu Daosheng, deputy director of the Civil Affairs and Judicial Commission of the Provincial People's Congress.

Expelling a problematic kid from school just makes it more likely that he or she will become a juvenile delinquent, he said.

The draft also bans violence, horror and atrocities from Guangdong radio and television programs. No crime-related video content can be screened from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and no overseas animation content is allowed from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

The draft will be reviewed by the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress on Dec. 1.
