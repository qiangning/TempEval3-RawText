US actress Jennifer Aniston has filed suit against a photographer for allegedly illegally using a telephoto lens to take snapshots of her when she was topless in her own home.

The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Friday alleges that Peter Brandt used "a powerful telephoto lens" to capture images of Aniston last month "in the privacy of her home," where she could only be observed "from a great distance through invasive, intrusive and unlawful measures."

Attorneys for the actress charge Brandt then offered to sell the photos to various media organizations.

Aniston is seeking damages and an injunction stopping Brandt -- and any organization that bought the photos from him -- from using them.
