Japanese trading house Itochu Corp. will soon start building an electricity generating plant and gas compressor station at two Azerbaijani oilfields in the Caspian Sea region, the Azerbaijani news agency Turan reported Tuesday.

The generating plant at the Neft Dashlary offshore field will cost some 60 million dollars, which will be covered by a Japanese government credit, a senior manager at the Azerbaijani national oil company SOCAR said.

The gas compressor station at the Bakhare field will cost around 100 million dollars, covered by a Japanese Export-Import Bank credit.

In March 1996 Itochu announced it would take a 2.45 percent stake in a multi-billion-dollar international project to develop Azerbaijani offshore oilfields.

British Petroleum and Amoco hold the largest stakes in the contract, worth more than 10 billion dollars, which was signed in September 1994.
