Three people were killed and several others wounded Sunday when Kenyan police clashed with residents of the capital's largest slum over a banned political rally, police and witnesses said.

Violence started when police moved in to block a former leader of Mungiki, a banned cult with criminal ties, from a holding the rally in Kibera slums, south of Nairobi.

Witnesses said the General Service Unit, a paramilitary wing of Kenyan police, opened fire on rioters, killing two, while a third was allegedly slashed to death.

"As far as I am concerned, my officers had no instructions to use live bullets. We are investigating the alleged shooting," said Nairobi police commander Njue Njagi.

Doctors in the capital's Masaba hospital said six people were treated for gunshot wounds after the clash in Kibera, one of Africa's largest slums and home to an estimated 800,000 people.

A passing cargo train was derailed, administration police booths razed and several shops looted in several hours of violence, witnesses said.

Police had banned the rally by ex-Mungiki leader Ndura Wairunge, who plans to run against the influential Raila Odinga in next year's parliamentary elections.

The Mungiki are a shadowy politico-religious group with alleged ties to Kenya's 1950s pre-indedependence Mau Mau uprising and blamed for a string of recent murders and violent robberies around the east African nation.

Last month, at least eight people were killed and thousands displaced from their homes when gang warfare rocked the capital's Mathare slums, home to about 400,000 people.

Police have warned of an upsurge in political violence in Kenya ahead of December 2007 general elections when President Mwai Kibaki is expected to face strong opposition from cabinet ministers he fired last year.
