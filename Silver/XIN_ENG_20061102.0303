Cyprus promised Thursday its continued efforts for the Finnish initiative on Nicosia-Ankara ties after the rotating EU presidency decided to call off consultations with all parties concerned with a view to avert any crisis in EU-Turkish relations.

In a statement, Government Spokesman Christodoulos Pashiardis noted that Nicosia has been officially informed by Finland that no proximity consultations will take place on the Finnish initiative though it will continue its efforts.

"We understand that this development (the cancellation of consultations) is due to the positions and the terms presented by the Turkish side, which with its whole stance has rendered the holding of proximity consultations unachievable," Pashiardis said.

"The Cypriot government will continue to hold consultations with the Finnish Presidency, observing the same constructive stance and attitude that it has maintained so far," he added.

Finland, as the rotating EU presidency, has been working on a draft proposal, providing for opening of Turkish occupied port of Famagusta under the EU administration for 24 months in combination with the opening of Turkish ports to ships carrying the Cypriot flag and the transfer of Famagusta to the UN.

For the purpose, it has been focusing on preparing the ground for a possible meeting over the weekend in Helsinki between Cyprus and Turkey.

However, Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja announced earlier on Thursday that the consultations in Finland were cancelled, but "efforts to find a solution that will enable the uninterrupted continuation of Turkey's accession negotiations and improve the situation of both communities in Cyprus will continue. "

The Finnish presidency is trying to avert any possible derailment of Turkey's EU accession course, following Ankara's refusal to meet its EU obligations and Cyprus' position that Turkey must do exactly that before accession negotiations are allowed to move further on, said Tuomioja.

Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily intervened and occupied the north of Cyprus following a coup by a group of Greek officers.

Turkey, a country aspiring to become an EU member state, does not recognize the Republic of Cyprus and has failed so far to implement the EU-Turkey Customs Union Protocol, which provides for opening of its ports and airports to Cyprus.

The EU formally launched talks with Turkey over the country's accession last October. The negotiations are expected to last at least a decade and Ankara is required to meet a number of criteria spelled out by the EU before entry.

The Republic of Cyprus, which entered the EU on behalf of the whole island in May 2004, is able to block Turkey's entry talks with its veto.
