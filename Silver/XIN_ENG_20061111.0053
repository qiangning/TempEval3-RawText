The 24th session of the Botswana- Zimbabwe Joint Permanent Commission on Defense and Security ended in south Zimbabwe city of Masvingo on Friday after intensive deliberations on critical bilateral issues, The Herald reported on Saturday.

The four-day meeting discussed bilateral issues of mutual interest in areas of defense and state and public security between Zimbabwe and Botswana, the newspaper said.

In a statement issued at the end of the meeting held at Great Zimbabwe, the Minister of State for National Security, Lands, Land Reform and Resettlement Didymus Mutasa said the commission discussed a wide range of issues that were pertinent to Botswana and Zimbabwe and also of concern to the region.

These included wildlife matters, stock theft, illicit trafficking of drugs, gold, diamonds, firearms and the containment of general crime along the common border, immigration and customs issues.

The commission also applauded the co-operation and communication that exists at provincial and operational levels and urged this interaction to continue, said Mutasa.

Zimbabwe and Botswana's co-operation in wildlife management including the establishment of the Shashe/Limpopo and Kavango/ Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation areas was greatly appreciated by the commission which hailed the move as an indication of close cooperation.

To this end, the commission also hailed the donation of a male black rhino to Botswana by Zimbabwe as a gesture of goodwill that sought to further strengthen existing cordial relations.

Mutasa said the commission also expressed satisfaction at the conclusion of the memorandum of understanding on the construction of Kazungula Bridge by Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, especially as the bridge was going to play a pivotal role in the region's socio-economic development.

In response, Botswana Minister of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration Phandu Skelemani hailed the joint permanent commission on defense and security between the two countries which he said had been a successful platform to amicably solve any sticking problems between the two countries.

Skelemani said the commission was a platform to come up with developmental initiatives that could benefit the people of Botswana and Zimbabwe. He also extended an invitation to the Zimbabwean delegation to attend the 25th session that will be hosted by Botswana next year.
