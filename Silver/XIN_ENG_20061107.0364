Trade between Mexico and China is growing fast, and Mexico is seeking to further boost its trade with China, a Mexican offcial said on Tuesday.

Roberto Zapata Barradas, director general for multilateral and regional negotiations at the Economy Secretary, told Xinhua that Mexico is seeking to balance its trade with China, due to a large surplus in favor of China.

China has also expressed the willingness to allow more Mexican exports, especially in mining and chemicals, according to Zapata, who said Mexico was drawing up a list of companies that could meet Chinese demand.

Mexico is seeking agricultural hygiene agreements with China so that it can export limes, mangos and beef. It has already reached agreements to export grapes and avocados to China, he said.

He said that Chinese authorities had already authorized a Mexican pavilion for the Latin American Commercial Fair in the first half of 2007 in Beijing.

China-Mexico trade tops eight billion U.S. dollars a year, with China exporting 6.8 billion more goods than Mexico.

Senior officials from the two countries discussed bilateral trade last week in Beijing during the third meeting of the High Level Group.

Zapata said Mexico is seeking deals on steel and electronics, as well as considering possible ways to boost trade between the two nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico is working to set up two forums, one in China and one in Mexico, to promote investment in automobile, and is considering importing Chinese-made cars, he said.
