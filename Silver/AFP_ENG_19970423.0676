International rating agency Moody's Investors Service said Thursday it has assigned a medium grade rating to long-term foreign currency debt of a Hong Kong-listed China-owned firm.

Moody's assigned a "Baa 3" rating to long-term foreign currency debt guaranteed by China International Trust and Investment Corp. Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd, which owns CITIC Pacific Ltd.

It said that the rating reflected "the critical position" of CITIC Hong Kong in the group structure of the Beijing-based China International Trust and Investment Corp.

CITIC Hong Kong's role within the group's structure underpins its credit strength, Moody's said.
