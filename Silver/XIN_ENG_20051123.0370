The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) of Sri Lanka has urged wildlife officials to guard against possible detection of signs of bird-flu as the bird- migration season began, Daily News reported Thursday.

The DWLC in cooperation with the Sri Lankan Animal Production and Health Department conducted a workshop recently to help wildlife workers learn about bird flu and possible methods through which the virus could enter the country.

Birds fly into tropical countries to escape harsh winters and take refuge in Sri Lanka's wetlands such as Bundala, Kumana and Anawilundawa. These national parks are habitats to a wide range of fauna.

The workshop studied different possible aspects of the virus affecting Sri Lanka's birdlife with migratory birds joining local waterfowl in catchment areas.
