Philippine police and navy started the search on Friday for a reportedly crashed light plane in Ballesteros, Mindanao, south of the country.

Ballesteros police chief Joel Cumlad said a composite team from the police, fire department and navy has been searching the sea and shore for the plane, but authorities have yet to recover any aircraft debris that would confirm the crash.

Search and rescue operations are ongoing in the area with vessels and airplanes dispatched early Friday morning for the operations, officials said.

Local residents of Santa Cruz village in Ballesteros said that the plane, believed to be a two-seater Cessna, was cruising at a low altitude over the village when it suddenly hit treetops and then plunged into the sea at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday night, according to the police.

However, Air Transportation Office (ATO) on Friday said no plane was flying at the time when the aircraft reportedly crashed at the supposed spot.

ATO chief Nilo Jatico said that the agency's records showed that all aircraft had been accounted for as of Friday morning.

"We have checked on our general aviation aircraft in Mindanao and no plane was flying at that particular time, including those that are privately owned," he said.

Local police earlier said they could not launch a thorough search at the coast due to strong waves.
