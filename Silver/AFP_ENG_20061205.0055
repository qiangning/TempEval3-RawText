Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has become the latest Iraqi leader to angrily reject UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's call for an international conference to resolve the crisis in Iraq.

Maliki also bitterly criticised Annan for likening the situation in Iraq to a civil war and accused him of polishing "the image of the former regime known for its crimes against humanity", in statement received by AFP on Tuesday.

On Sunday, Annan said in a BBC interview that he understood why some Iraqis might regret the fall of former dictator Saddam Hussein.

"If I were an average Iraqi obviously I would make the same comparison, that they had a dictator who was brutal but they had their streets, they could go out, their kids could go to school and come back home," Annan said.

Annan had earlier proposed that an internation conference might be a way to end the fighting in Iraq, where Maliki's government faces both an insurgency and mounting conflict between the Sunni and Shiite communities.

But Maliki rejected this idea out of hand.

"The Iraqi government, erected on a constitutional base, can not accept the idea of holding an international conference about Iraq which would reverse all the political developments that have taken place and impose international guardianship on the Iraqi people," said the statement.

Maliki's rejection of the conference came in the wake of similar rejections by Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and top Shiite cleric Abdel Aziz Hakim, and left the idea dead on arrival.
