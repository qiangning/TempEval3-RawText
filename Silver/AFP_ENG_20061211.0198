Israel has blocked a UN human rights fact-finding mission led by South African Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu into the killing of 19 Palestinians in their homes in the Gaza Strip, a United Nations official in Geneva said Monday.

Israeli authorities will not grant Tutu and his team the necessary travel authorisation, the official added.

The UN Human Rights Council voted on November 15 to set up the fact-finding mission into the deaths during an Israeli artillery bombardment in Beit Hanun.   The mission was intended to assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors, and make recommendations on ways "to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli attacks".

Tutu, the former Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, chaired the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of the apartheid regime.

The decision to dispatch the mission revealed divisions within the Human Rights Council, which has been criticised by the outgoing Secretary General Kofi Annan for excessive focus on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

Thirty-two countries in the 47-member Council, mainly from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, voted for the resolution setting up the mission.

Eight countries, including Canada and European nations such as Britain and Germany, opposed the move. Six countries, including France, Switzerland and Japan, abstained.

Nineteen Palestinians were killed on November 18 in the shelling of private homes in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanun, which the Israeli military blamed on a technical malfunction.
