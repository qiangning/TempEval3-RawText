Chinese President Hu Jintao on Friday expressed satisfaction over the development of Sino- Australian relations.

"The relations between China and Australia have maintained good momentum," Hu said when meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard before the economic leaders' informal meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

Since the two countries agreed to develop comprehensive and cooperative ties for mutual benefit in the 21st century, they have conducted exchanges actively in the fields of trade and economy, culture, science and technology as well as education and tourism, Hu said.

The Chinese president said both countries should cement their cooperation in energy, push forward talks on China-Australia free trade agreement (FTA), and intensify consultation on international and regional issues.

Howard said Australia hoped to advance the FTA talks with China through further discussions, and expected closer cooperation in energy security, climate changes and exchanges of personnel.

He said his country supported China to play a critical role in solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, and both countries will make efforts to achieve the peaceful settlement of the issue by strengthening consultation and coordination.

President Hu is in Hanoi for a state visit, where he will also attend the Nov. 18-19 APEC economic leaders' informal meeting.
