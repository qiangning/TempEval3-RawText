The Myanmar health authorities have stressed the need for eye care services in the country especially in the rural areas where the majority of the blind exist, a state- run newspaper reported Friday.

It was emphasized at a conference of eye ophthalmologists which is underway, the New Light of Myanmar said.

In Myanmar, there are some major eye diseases in prevalence such as cataract, trachoma and vitamin-C deficiency which can cause loss of sight.

Meanwhile, Myanmar has since 1999 launched a campaign aimed at bringing down the rate of avoidable blindness to less than 0.5 percent of its population as part of its efforts to eliminate such avoidable blindness by 2020 set by the World Health Organization.

Under a memorandum of understanding signed in 2003, a "Vision Myanmar Program" has also been established by the Myanamr health ministry and the Royal Adelaide Hospital of Australia to provide opportunities for Myanmar eye surgeons to receive post-graduate training at the Australian hospital.

The program provides for Australian specialists to visit Myanmar annually to conduct training at two eye hospitals in Yangon and Mandalay where about 7,000 to 1,200 surgical operations on eye patients are respectively carried out each year.

In fighting blindness, Myanmar has also since 1964 launched trachoma control and blindness program to tackle the problem of blindness and the incidence of trachoma is being brought down from 43 percent to less than 4 percent.

Official statistics show that a total of 46,530 eye patients were cured under Mynamar's blindness control program which was implemented from 1989 to 1999. Of them 34,440 were cured of cataract and 12,090 cured of glaucoma.
