The United States (U.S.) Thursday said that it will be continuing its assistance to Nepal even after the guerrilla joins the interim government.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Richard A. Boucher, who arrived in Kathmandu Wednesday on a three-day visit, made the assurance during a meeting with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and Speaker of the House of Representatives Subash Chandra Nemwang.

The senior U.S. official made the comments in a bid to quell all misapprehensions regarding the continuation of U.S. assistance after the guerrillas -- which the U.S. had previously terrorist- tagged -- join the Nepal government.

Making a brief statement to media persons after the meeting with Koirala, Boucher said, "The U.S. is ready to continue its assistance to Nepal for the welfare of the Nepali people."

The senior U.S. official discussed the on-going peace process and the overall Nepalese political situation besides issues of U.S. assistance with Koirala.
