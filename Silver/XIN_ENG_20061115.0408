Jordan drubbed Oman 3-0 and gained a measure of revenge in the AFC Asian Cup 2007 final Group C qualifier here late Wednesday.

In the previous round, Oman had sneaked into the finals with a 2-1 win over the already-qualified United Arab Emirates, rendering inconsequential Jordan's rousing 3-0 defeat of Pakistan.

All the three Jordanian goals were scored in the last 10 minutes. Amer Deeb was the first to hit the net in the 80th minute, followed in quick succession by Rafat Ali (84) and Hassona Al Shaikh (90).

Jordan finished third with 10 points while Oman could not improve on the 12 points they had before today's match.
