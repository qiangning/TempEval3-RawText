With just hours left for the International Rugby Board (IRB) to vote for the host of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, South Africans hold their breath in anticipation of winning the second chance to stage the world rugby showpiece.

The decision by the IRB at its Dublin headquarters in Ireland has been described as a choice between traditional strongholds, South Africa and New Zealand and Japan.

But in Dublin the word was that it would quickly become a two-way fight because most observers late Wednesday night were predicting that New Zealand would be eliminated in the first round of voting, a South African newspaper said on Thursday.

This would leave South Africa and Japan to battle for the privilege of staging the sport's seventh world championship.

Local newspaper The Star said on Thursday that Japan was seen as "the national likeliest to take the event from us."

If the IRB is determined to get the sport into the Olympic Games, probably at the London Olympics of 2012, pressure could be applied on delegates to back Japan's bid, it said.

"Reported recent comments by former Olympic supremo Juan Antonio Samaranch that rugby had no chance of gaining entry because it was not a truly global sport would be answered if the decision were made to take the 2011 Rugby World Cup to Japan," it said.

Koji Tokomasu, chief executive of the Japanese Rugby Union, has reportedly lobbied that the potential for opening up a vast new market in Asia for the sport was enormous, should his bid prevail.

Asia has 60 percent of the world's population and its economic growth has been phenomenal.

Japan has only 126,000 registered rugby players but its population of 127 million, vast economy and ability to bring rugby to a new Asian audience make it a strong contender, The Star said.

South Africa's bid is led by Francois Pienaar, who captained the national squad, the Springboks, to victory in 1995.

He argued that the event in South Africa should also help spread the sport throughout Africa.

New Zealand hosted - and won - the first World Cup in 1987, with the event taking place in South Africa eight years later, when the Springboks were victorious.

Australia hosted the 2003 World Cup, won by England. The quatrennially event will next be held in France in 2007.

Members of the IRB Council will meet in Dublin on Thursday to hear final presentations of the three bidding countries and cast their vote. The host country is expected to be announced at around 16:00 GMT on Thursday.
