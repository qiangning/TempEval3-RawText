Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Tuesday reiterated his country's longstanding position that it will not confirm or deny having nuclear weapons.

"Israel will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the region. That is our policy and it has not changed," he told a press conference after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

"There is no need to explain it any further."

Olmert sparked an uproar on Monday when he made remarks in an interview with a German television station that were interpreted by some as a break with Israel's traditional nuclear "policy of ambiguity".

He told N24 Sat1 television: "Iran openly, explicitly and publicly threatens to wipe Israel off the map.

"Can you say that this is the same level, when they are aspiring to have nuclear weapons, as France, America, Russia and Israel?"

Th apparent blunder came less than a week after Israeli officials rounded on the incoming US defense secretary Robert Gates for the same slip-up, and drew calls from across the political spectrum in Israel for Olmert to resign.

The prime minister's spokeswoman however immediately denied that his words had signalled any departure from established policy.

Israel's policy of nuclear ambiguity dates back to the early 1960s, to an agreement struck with the United States and France.

Under this policy, the Jewish state would not carry out any nuclear tests and would stay silent on the issue in order to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

Observers have warned however that Olmert's statement could undermine efforts by Israel and the West to prevent its arch-foe Iran from pursuing its bitterly contested nuclear power program.

But they also said that the prime minister's remarks were unlikely to change the way the world views the Jewish state's nuclear capabilities because it is widely assumed to have an atomic arsenal.

Olmert on Tuesday described Iran's hardline regime as "a danger" for all of the western world. Israel and the West fear that Tehran's nuclear power programme masks an attempt to develop nuclear weapons.
