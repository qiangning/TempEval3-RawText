The Zairean presidency accused Angolan troops of attacking its southwestern Bas-Zaire province, sending 1,400 troops to aid Zaireans rebels led by Laurent Kabila.

In a statement broadcast on state radio the presidency said the troops had crossed into the Yema municpality near the border with Angola.

"Today, everyone knows that Angolan troops are attacking Zaire for no reason and without declaring war," the statement said.

Angolan troops were also in the area of Tshipaka, in Western Kasai province, a city some 650 kilometres (400 miles) southeast of the capital Kinshasa which Kabila's forces said Wednesday they had captured.

According to the presidency statement the Kinshasa authorities will raise the Angolan incursions with the United Nations, and ask UN envoy Alioune Blondin Beye to visit the zones currently occupied by Angolan forces.
