Work on London's Olympic Park for the 2012 Games got underway on Thursday.

The site in the east end of England's capital city is being cleared of empty buildings to allow construction of the Park to begin.

A disused sports hall on Eton Manor, to the north of the site, was the first building to be demolished.

The Eton Manor area of the Park will feature a centre that is expected to host tennis and archery during the Paralympic Games and be a training area during the Olympics.

Eton Manor is an historic venue in British sport as it hosted the first athletics meeting in the United Kingdom after the Second World War.

An Olympic Delivery Authority spokesman said: "We will be preserving the proud sporting heritage of this area by knocking down crumbling, disused facilities and replacing them with state of the art sporting venues that will be at the heart of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.

"The new facilities we will build, along with the new bridges better linking them into the local community and new walking and cycling routes, will mean that London 2012 will leave a significant sporting legacy in the north of the Olympic Park for generations to come.

"We are planning Games and legacy together now to ensure we only build permanent venues if there is a long-term legacy use."
