Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi made a flying visit to the rebel- held southern Albanian town of Vlore on Sunday, telling townspeople that he "shared their pain," witnesses said.

Speaking from a balcony of the town hall, Prodi told thousands of residents: "I salute the people of Vlore. I offer my condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones and I share their pain."

The Italian leader, accompanied by Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino, was then whisked to Tirana aboard an Italian military helicopter for a meeting with authoritarian President Sali Berhisa.

Italy leads a 6,000-strong multinational force being sent to Albania to secure routes for humanitarian supplies pouring into the country wracked by weeks of anarchy.

The unrest blew into a full-scale armed uprising in the south, with the port town of Vlore at its hub.

Prodi told reporters: "Italy has an important mission to reconstruct Albania." He said the aim of the mission, codenamed Alba, was peaceful, noting: "Alba means dawn but it also means renaissance."

He said his government would provide additional "technical and financial assistance" to Vlore, and that an Italian consulate would be set up in the town. "It is only the beginning of aid to Albania," he said.

Three Italian military helicopters landed the two officials and their entourage earlier for a 90-minute visit to the town, during which they held talks with town leaders, journalists contacted by telephone from Tirana said.

The premiers met around 200 representatives of the town, including relatives of refugees who drowned when their overcrowded boat collided with an Italian naval vessel, an incident which sparked a wave of anti-Italian feeling in Albania.

Italy has received about 13,000 desperate Albanian refugee "boat people" who fled the lawlessness in the country, large parts of which are controlled by armed gangs.
