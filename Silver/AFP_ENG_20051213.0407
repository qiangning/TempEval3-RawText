Lebanon grappled with fresh political turmoil Tuesday as it mourned the killing of prominent anti-Syrian journalist and MP Gibran Tueni, while the United States ratcheted up the pressure on Damascus.

On the eve of his funeral emotions ran high in downtown Beirut as hundreds of people massed outside the glass tower housing Tueni's top-selling An-Nahar newspaper for the second night running to pay tribute to their hero.

"Tueni is alive in us," shouted the mostly young crowds after calls by the ruling anti-Syrian majority in parliament urging them to mobilise for a national funeral on Wednesday for the 48-year-old press magnate.

The coalition, a cross-section of Muslim and Christian politicians, called for an emergency parliament session to debate the future of pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud after blaming former powerbroker Damascus for Tueni's killing.

"We urge parliament to hold an emergency session to discuss the dangerous situation generated by the police state that prevails at the highest level, namely the head of state," they said in a statement.

They accused Lahoud's backers in Damascus, who pressed for a three-year extension of his mandate in September 2004, for the new bloodshed.

"By assassinating Gibran Tueni, the Syrian regime ... has renewed its war on Lebanon."

Tueni was killed in a massive car bomb blast Monday just a day after his return from France where he had been spending time for fear of an attempt on his life, and 302 days after the assassination of former billionaire prime minister Rafiq Hariri.

The United States, which has joined world condemnation of the murder, on Tuesday urged the United Nations to turn the heat on Damascus.

"We believe it's important, when the Security Council discusses this report, that they continue to keep the pressure, and increase the pressure, on Syria," White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.

The UN Security Council was set to examine the second report in two months released by German magistrate Detlev Mehlis on the Hariri murder, after investigators heard testimony from five senior Syrian officials.

The latest report said there was fresh evidence further implicating senior Syrian and Lebanese officers in the Beirut bomb blast that killed Hariri.

The government also faced political divisions after five ministers from Shiite groups loyal to Damascus refused to join a vote calling for an international probe into the wave of bombings and assassinations.

Prime Minister Fuad Siniora struggled to form his 24-member cabinet in July -- the first elected government since Syria pulled its last troops from Lebanon in April under intense domestic and international pressure.

It includes ministers from the Shiite movements Amal and Hezbollah -- a fundamentalist group with its own guerrillas that Washington regards as a terrorist organization -- that wield large grassroot support across Lebanon.

Their support for the government is necessary to maintain the fragile coalition and has prompted calls from anti-Syrian politicians on Amal and Hezbollah ministers to reconsider their decision for the sake of Lebanese unity.

But pro-Hezbollah Foreign Minister Fawzi Salloukh already put the decision into action by failing to show up at his office Tuesday and cancelling a meeting with a top UN official.

Tueni was instrumental in the campaign to end 30 years of Syrian political and military domination of Lebanon and has been hailed as a "martyr" of the country's fragile regained independence.

Thousands of tearful and defiant mourners filed into St Nicholas Church in the Christian neighborhood of Ashrafiyeh to offer their condolences to Tueni's father, Ghassan, a respected former cabinet minister and veteran diplomat, and his widow.

"There is no doubt that Syria is behind all the crimes committed in Lebanon (over the past year) to impose anew its domination over the country," said 22-year-old law student Nayla Anid.

Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz, meanwhile, warned that Syria could try to stir up tension on the Lebanon-Israel border to divert attention from the Hariri probe.
