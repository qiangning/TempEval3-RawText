The first Thai ambassdor to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Danai Tulalampa, has died of cancer, a foreign ministry official said Thursday.

Danai, 61, who died Monday, was appointed in early 1995 as the first Thai ambassdor to the WTO, where he chaired the agriculture committee before retiring at age 60.

Before working at the WTO, he held posts as deputy permanent secretary of the commerce ministry and director-general of the foreign ministry's economic department.

He also served as ambassdor to Belgium and to the European Union for four years from 1988.
