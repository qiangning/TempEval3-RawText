HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death of South African children under the age of five, the Children's Institute said in Cape Town on Tuesday.

"Forty percent of deaths of children under the age of five years are directly attributable to AIDS and a further 30 percent to diseases of poverty," CI Director Marian Jacobs said.

The HIV/AIDS pandemic is first among a number of factors that are standing in the way of realizing child rights in South Africa, and the country needs a comprehensive response to children infected and affected by the disease.

This is the message from the Children's Institute, as it launched a publication on the situation of South Africa's children to coincide with World AIDS day on December 1.

This year's edition, the South African Child Gauge 2005, focuses on the theme of children and HIV/AIDS.

The professor said: "The second major obstacle to the realization of child rights is the ongoing income inequality and widespread poverty that continue in the country."

"The unemployment rate is rising alongside the HIV infection rate and this is of great concern, because poverty deepens the effects of HIV/AIDS on households, while the disease in turn aggravates already existing poverty," she added.

With a total population of 47 million, an estimated 5.2 million South Africans, or 11 percent of the population, are infected with HIV, according to a report the Actuarial Society of SA in local daily here on Tuesday.
