Burundian Hutu rebels killed more than 40 people during a raid on a seminary at Buta, in the south of the country, an army spokesman said here Wednesday.

The rebels killed 34 pupils and seven lay members of the seminary in the attack Tuesday, the spokesman told independent Ijambo radio.

Another 34 seminarists were seriously wounded, he said.

The spokesman said the Tutsi-dominated army had killed almost 300 Hutu rebels in Makamba province, in the far south, since the outbreak of fighting in the region on April 4.
