Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Monday that he expects the UN commission of enquiry into the murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri to "correct its mistakes."

"In the first place we expect this enquiry to be professional and the commission to correct the mistakes it made earlier in order to form a report that is fair and objective," al-Assad said on France 3 television.

The Syrian leader was speaking as investogators began questioning five Syrian officials at UN headquarters in Vienna as part of the international enquiry led by German magistrate Detlev Mehlis.

The identities of the five have not been made public, but officials have said that Assaf Shawkat, Assad's brother-in-law and head of military intelligence, is not among them.

"There were witnesses who gave false testimony. Recently there has been a Syrian witness who admitted he was forced to provide evidence that backed up a particular point of view .... That gives us cause for concern," al-Assad said.

Last week state television in Syria showed an interview with Syrian witness Hussam Taher Hussam who said he had provided evidence to the commission under duress.

"There is no proof that Syria was involved (in the assassination). There is no criminal proof, and it was not in the interests of Syria to commit such an act," Assad said.
