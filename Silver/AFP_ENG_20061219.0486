The UN refugee agency has begun to fly home 1,800 Angolan refugees who have lived in the Democratic Republic of Congo for many years, it announced on Tuesday.

"Some 50 of them left (Monday) afternoon on the first flight from Kinshasa to Mbanza Kongo, in the north of Angola," said a statement from the office in the DRC capital of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Until December 30, there will be three daily flights carrying a total of about 150 Angolans who have volunteered for repatriation, with a Christmas break between December 24 and 25, the agency said.

Refugee flights are costly, but the UNHCR said that "return transport by air is currently the only possible option due to the condition of roads and bridges that are inaccessible in the rainy season".

Angolan refugees moved into the DRC during the course of a civil war that ravaged their southern African country from independence in 1975 until 2002, but the UNHCR said that by the end of this year, 52,000 of them should be home.

The Angolan government paid for Monday's first airlift, the UNHCR said.

Voluntary repatriations began after the DRC, Angola and the UN agency signed a tripartite accord in 2003, the year a regional war that had raged across the vast central African country came to an end. During that conflict, Angola was one of three countries to send troops to support Kinshasa against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

The refugees are being flown either to Mbanza Kongo or to Uige in northern Angola and the UNHCR allows them to take 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of luggage, and gives them either cash subsidies or assistance packages of food and items like cooking utensils, depending on their destination.

The latest registered number of Angolan refugees in the DRC was 145,000, among 224,000 refugees from neighbouring countries. The UNHCR also estimates that 410,000 DRC refugees live abroad, mainly in Tanzania, Zambia and Congo.
