Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the recently ousted president of Cambodia's co-ruling Funcinpec Party, here Thursday gave up his efforts to establish a new party, and turned to preside the rarely-known Khmer Front Party in anticipation of the upcoming communal and general elections.

"I must merge with other party to compete in the communal election in April 2007 and the general election in 2008, because the Interior Ministry has delayed my proposal to establish a new party," he told reporters at its headquarters.

"They raised the so-called technical points to delay the registration of my party. There is no technical reason, but political reason," he added.

In response, Sak Sitha, political party expert at the Interior Ministry told Xinhua by phone that he would not explain about this case and he had not seen the prince's requests yet.

Additionally, Khiev Sopheak, spokesman of the Interior Ministry, told Xinhua that he could not understand the prince's choice.

The old party should be dissolved if it merged with another party, he added.

Meanwhile, Suth Dina, former president of Khmer Front Party, told reporters that he and other party members were very happy to hand over the party to Ranariddh.

"We all approved of handing over this party to him in order to strengthen the royalist regime in Cambodia," he said, adding that the Khmer Front Party revised its by-law and changed its name to the Norodom Ranariddh Party on Thursday.

Ranariddh, son of former king Sihanouk who inaugurated Funcinpec, said that people would vote for him because they knew him when he President of Funcinpec.

"I am now the opposition party," he said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party and Funcinpec currently shared the power with the ruling Cambodian People's Party headed by Prime Minister Hun Sen.

"I am strong at the grass root level," he said.

The Norodom Ranariddh Party would care about freedom of expression, democracy, defense of royalist regime and territory, free multi-party system as well as respect for Cambodian Constitution, he said.

Ranariddh was expelled from Funicipec on Oct. 18 by his brother in-law Keo Puth Rasmey, Former Cambodian Ambassador to Germany, because he spent too much time abroad to care about the party and could not cooperate with Hun Sen.
