Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and visiting South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki Moon agreed on Monday to enhance cooperation in having the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) stop its nuclear plan.

Abe and Ban exchanged ideas over the resumption of six-party talks on Korean Peninsula nuclear issue. The premier said that dialogues under the six-party talks framework and pressure sent through the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution are equally important.

During their meeting, the two also touched on the reforms of the United Nations. Ban, who is to assume the post of UN secretary general in January, said that he is willing to discuss issues in the United Nations with the Japanese government.

Ban arrived in Japan on Sunday and held talks with his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso later in the day. Their talks also centered around the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.

The six-party talks on the Korean Peninsular nuclear issue, which involves the DPRK, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States, were last held in November, 2005.
