The management of Air France Europe said it could guarantee 60 percent of flights Sunday, despite a decision by pilots to extend a strike until Monday.

The most severe disruption was expected on flights from Paris' Orly airport to the three main southern cities of Nice, Marseille and Toulouse.

Almost all these flights were cancelled on Friday and Saturday, but AFE said "some" would be running Sunday.

All flights from Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport would be running as usual, as well as flights between provincial towns.

The strike was called in protest over the conditions of the carrier's merger with state-owned Air France.
