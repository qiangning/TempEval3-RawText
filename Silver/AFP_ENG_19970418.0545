A Republican-controlled Congressional committee has decided to beef up a probe into the 1996 election of a Democratic Senator from Louisiana, sparking a fresh partisan furor.

The Rules and Administration Committee angered Democrats by voting Thursday to appoint a top Republican lawyer as head of an expanded investigation into Senator Mary Landrieu's narrow victory last November.

Landrieu won by a mere 5,788 votes over Republican rival Louis "Woody" Jenkins, who has charged that the local Democratic machine committed widespread fraud, including paying voters in impoverished New Orleans neighborhoods to vote more than once.

Last week, two lawyers hired by the committee -- one Republican, one Democrat -- said they wanted to look into three charges relating to voter fraud before making a recommendation on a full-scale investigation.

However, the nine-member committee bypassed their appeals and agreed to a probe headed by Republican heavyweight Richard Cullen, who is set to become the attorney general of the state of Virginia.

The Democrats responded that the Cullen probe would sanction a "fishing expedition" on behalf of a revenge-seeking Jenkins and would undermine the principle of bi-partisanship in Senate investigations.
