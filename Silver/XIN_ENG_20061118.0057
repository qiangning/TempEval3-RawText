Finland's Marcus Gronholm established a big lead after the second day of the Rally of New Zealand in Hamilton on Saturday.

Gronholm won three of Saturday's six stages around Waikato to head into Sunday's final leg with a commanding 50.3 second lead over his Finnish team mate Mikko Hirvonen.

Austria's Manfred Stohl, driving a Peugeot, finished the day in third place with Spain's Dani Sordo fourth in a Citroen. Both were more than two minutes behind Gronholm.

Italian MotoGP ace Valentino Rossi climbed 10 places to finish the day 13th, but is almost 17 minutes off the pace.

The 27-year-old Yamaha rider failed to progress beyond the first day at his only previous appearance in the British round of the 2002 world rally championship but has been driving more cautiously this time.

Gronholm, who is assured of finishing second behind Senastien Loeb in this year's driver's championship, is bidding to join Frenchman Carlos Sainz as the only four-time winners of the New Zealand Rally.
