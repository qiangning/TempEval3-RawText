A hitherto unknown piano score extremely likely to be by the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has been discovered in the composer's birthplace Salzburg, Austrian broadcaster ORF said on Wednesday.

The score's facsimile will be officially presented and played by clavichordist Florian Birsak on Friday, it said.

Some time ago, the archives of the city's episcopal office were offered unsigned keyboard works, including an "Allegro di Wolfgango Mozart". Detailed tests led experts to conclude that the piece was indeed written by the master, when he was between six and 10 years old.

A second score in the collection could also be by Mozart.

Mozart was born 250 years ago, and Austria has been abuzz with events marking the occasion all year long.
