Fiji's political leaders agreed Wednesday to retain more ethnic-based seats than open seats in parliament under a new constitution being negotiated here.

The decision was reached unanimously by a 25-member parliamentary select committee appointed to negotiate consensus on a new charter to replace the post-coup document widely seen as racist.

By agreeing to a majority of ethnically elected seats, the review committee has rejected the guiding principle of a three-man commission which reviewed and reported on constitutional reform.

The commission headed by Sir Paul Reeves, former governor general of New Zealand, had recommended 45 open or nationally elected seats as opposed to 25 ethnically elected seats in a 70-member new Parliament.

In a statement late Wednesday, the committee said it had agreed to "the principle of retaining a larger percentage of communal seats and a smaller percentage of open seats."

Details would be worked out later, the committee said.

The select committee last week endorsed a multi-racial cabinet under a new constitution in what Indian leaders immediately hailed as one of Fiji's most significant political concessions since the 1987 coups.

Fijian provincial councils have recently been vocal in their rejection of the Reeves Report recommendation and want instead a majority of seats to be contested on an ethnic roll.

Constitutional talks were adjourned until Monday to allow for a two- day meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs beginning Thursday.
