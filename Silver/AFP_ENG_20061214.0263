Gunfire and the squeal of tires echoed through downtown Baghdad on Thursday as gunmen in military uniforms sealed off a commercial street and snatched dozens of merchants in yet another brazen kidnapping.

At first, said witnesses, people were too stunned to move as around 20 silver sports utility vehicles without registration plates swooped down on the street and disgorged some hundred gunmen in camouflage fatigues.

The gang brandished waving assault rifles and the US-issued Glock pistols issued by the United States to Iraq's government security forces.

"They told people 'We are on official business, don't panic'," said Mohammed al-Motaie, a tea seller who witnessed the events.

A masked man selected individuals from the crowd and the gunmen hurled them into the waiting vehicles.

"One of the people being taken shouted he was from (Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's) Dawa Party," said Sami Mirza, a guard at one of the stores. "They said, 'Welcome, come with us, we were looking for you'."

He added that the gunmen stole money from the shops as well.

"They broke into the store of the building's owner and I wanted to open fire, but I was afraid they would kill him inside the shop," added the frightened guard.

Panic soon broke out as suspicions swept the street, one of the most important centers for autoparts in the city, that this was not an official venture at all.

"Then they started grabbing people haphazardly -- Sunnis, Shiites," said al-Motaie.

"I left my son for five minutes to have a nap at my house nearby, when I came back he was gone," said Sabah Abbu, a 50-year-old Christian with a small restaurant in the area.

"I contacted him immediately but his mobile was switched off."

Qassim Mohammed Ibrahim, a Shiite store owner, kept dialing numbers over and over on his phone. "They took away my three brothers," he said his eyes brimming with tears. "I have no one left."

People in the street said they called authorities who said they had no knowledge of any type of operation taking place in that area.

"Their response came very late," an official from a Shiite party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), said in disgust.

One policeman who was there, guarding a bank, said he felt helpless even though he was armed.

"How can I fight people in military or government uniforms?" he asked. "I have only 30 bullets in my gun while they had enough weapons and ammunition to face down an army."

Their cars full, the gunmen left after about half an hour, firing a fusillade of shots into the air as they drove away from the site, sending cars reversing across Baghdad's bridges to get out of their way.

Pedestrians could also be seen running away along the banks of the Tigris and scurrying for safety across the bridges.

Kidnappings in broad daylight have become just another deadly feature of daily life in Baghdad as lawlessness increasingly takes over the battered city.

The kidnappings are believed to be the work of shadowy gangs and are largely done for profit, although in some cases they result in the execution of the victims for apparently sectarian motives.

A new wave of panic swept the traumatized people of Rashid street when army forces pulled up to the site a little while later. People were terrified that they too were fakes.

"After this, I don't think anyone would dare open their shop in this place, especially after the government didn't defend them," said Mirza.
