The exiled leader of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Khaled Meshaal arrived in the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Wednesday night on a surprise visit, Egypt's official MENA news agency reported.

Meshaal and his accompanying delegation would hold talks with senior Egyptian officials on the latest developments in the Palestinian territories, means to revive the stalled peace process and the forming of a Palestinian unity government, MENA said in a short dispatch, without giving more details.

The prisoners' swap deal was reportedly also among the top agenda of Meshaal visit to Egypt.

However, contacts with the Egyptian foreign ministry failed to confirm the report.

But Hamas spokesman in Damascus confirmed the visit at midnight Wednesday, saying Meshaal has arrived Cairo.

Reports on Meshaal's visit to Egypt were abundant since late October.

On Oct. 29, a senior Egyptian official told Xinhua that Meshaal would visit Egypt soon, but failed to give an exact date.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at that time that Meshaal, now in exile in Syria, would visit Cairo in four or five days.

Also on Oct. 29, Egyptian Presidential Spokesman Suleiman Awwad said Egypt had invited Meshaal for a visit to broker negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel on a prisoner swap deal and help major Palestinian political factions to set up a unity government.

But Meshaal didn't come to Egypt in the end. Instead, he sent a delegation, which was led by Hamas representative in Syria Imad al- Alami, to Cairo on Oct. 31.

Egyptians have been aggressively playing a mediating role between Hamas and Fatah led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, both of which have been at loggerheads with each other over a series of political issues in the last several months.

The rift between Hamas and Fatah was deepened after Hamas defeated Fatah in legislative elections in January and thus given mandate to form the current government.

However, the fledging Hamas government was cornered shortly after it came to power due to the West's suspension of direct aid to the government, which was unable to pay its almost 160,000 civil servants.

Despite the deep financial crisis facing the government, Hamas still adhere to its rejection to international demands of recognizing Israel, honoring signed peace deals with Israel.

In order to walk out of the dual crises of economic and political, Palestinian factions, mainly Fatah and Hamas, have been dedicated to efforts to form a new Palestinian unity government to be accepted by international community.

Egyptian officials have also been actively coordinating a prisoners' swap deal, which involved Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was kidnapped and has been held hostage by Palestinian militants in Gaza since June.

The captors of Gilad Shalit call for releasing about 1,700 prisoners out of more than 10,000 detainees who are staying in Israeli custodies. They insist women, children and old prisoners be among those set to release under the swap.

Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, maintains good relations with both Israel and the Palestinians, and has long been playing a mediating role between the Palestinians and Israel.
