Six local people, including four children, drowned after their floating house capsized as the cable that tied it to a tree on the bank of Bassac River became broken, a police officer told Xinhua by phone on Tuesday.

"The cable was too old and the house roof was made from heavy clay. So, it forced the floating house to turn upside down," said En Savuth, deputy police chief of Sa-ang District, Kandal Province, some 25 kilometers south of the capital city.

As the tragedy happened on Tuesday, the two adults, 35 and 65 years old, and the four minors, 2, 7, 10 and 12 years old were having lunch, he said.

"When the floating house collapsed, the river had high currents and people could not survive in them," he added.

However, in the family of seven, one boy survived by jumping to the bank before the house collapsed, he said.

The house was built on a platform supported by 10 oil barrels. The only stabilizing force was a rope that tied it to the tree on the bank.

The capsized house floated some 300 meters away from the original place, creating panic for other floating house residents on the river, said Savuth.

Some riverside Cambodians tend to live in floating houses in order to easily fish and enjoy convenience of sanitation. Such a lifestyle can also help them save money for constructing house on land and escape the taxation and population management of the government.
