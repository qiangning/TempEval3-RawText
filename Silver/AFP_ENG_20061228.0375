Wales flanker Martyn Williams will be available for the start of this season's Six Nations Championship after avoiding a lengthy ban following a disciplinary hearing here Thursday.

The Cardiff back-row was sent-off for butting Neath-Swansea scrum-half Jason Spice during a Celtic League match last Saturday.

But Welsh Rugby Union disciplinary officials decided Williams's offence only merited a three-week suspension, which means the 64-times capped Wales forward can play again from mid-January.

He must now miss Cardiff's Celtic League clashes with Llanelli and the Borders, as well as the European Cup match away to English giants Leicester at Welford Road on January 13. But he will be available for the European tie with French side Bourgoin a week later.

Wales begin the 2007 Six Nations at home to Ireland on February 4.

"It was the first time I have been shown the red card in 12 seasons of playing rugby at senior level," said Williams.

"Consequently, I feel it was out of character and obviously I regret the incident. I would like to apologise to all concerned.

"I was disappointed with my reaction in the match, but I fully accept the findings of the (WRU) disciplinary sub-committee."
