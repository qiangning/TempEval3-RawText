Six victims in a colliery gas blast in north China's coal-rich province of Shanxi left hospital on Tuesday after treatment.

The other two survivors are still in hospital because of serious injuries, said Xinli hospital in the city of Linfen.

Investigators said a power failure earlier on Sunday afternoon and an ensuing gas explosion after the electricity restored 10 minutes later caused the accident.

"I'm so scared. I'll never do this job any more."said Li Hongjun, a hospitalized miner.

The electricity often breaks down in the colliery. Nobody asked the miners to get out of the well when the power was cut off, said Li.

The accident occurred at around 6:40 p.m. at Luweitan Colliery in Yaodu district in Linfen on Sunday. Twenty-four people were dead and eight injured.

Luweitan colliery is designed to produce 150,000 tons a year, but its production permit and safety license have both expired.

Police have detained the mine owner but its general manager is on the run.

Three days of colliery disasters in four provinces have left 85 Chinese workers dead since Saturday.

Chinese coal mines suffer frequent explosions, flooding and cave-ins, claiming about 6,000 lives a year.

Unsafe small coal mines account for two-thirds of the total fatalities in mine accidents, government figures show.
