Singapore's top insurer Great Eastern Life Assurance (GE Life) has set up an asset management arm to handle two billion Singapore dollars (1.4 billion US) in funds, the Straits Times reported Monday.

GE Life chief executive Tan Beng Lee told the newspaper that the new firm, Straits Lion Asset Management, will initially handle GE Life's own funds but would expand its activities later after establishing a track record.

"Subsequently, we would consider the management of third-party funds," Tan said.

The new company is to be 90-percent owned by GE Life and the rest by Straits Trading Co., a sister company under the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. group. Both are listed on the mainboard of the Stock Exchange of Singapore.

The move is part of GE Life's efforts to find better returns from its growing assets amid pressure on the Singapore insurance industry from declining investment income and low interest rates, the newspaper said.

GE Life's funds are currently being managed in-house.

"Straits Lion will provide a more active and focused platform in managing our funds," Tan was quoted as saying.

GE Life, with about 500,000 policyholders in a nation of three million, had an asset base of 9.5 billion dollars in 1996, up from only four billion dollars in 1992.

The report said that under insurance laws, life insurers can invest no more than 35 percent of their assets in equities, 20 percent in property, 20 percent in foreign funds, and the rest in cash and near cash.
