The Angolan women's national handball team, called "Angola 30 years", Thursday defeated Congo-Brazzaville 28-25 in their opener of the international tournament in Cabinda, Angolan North province, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the national independence.

The Angolan women dominated the match by running ahead with a 7-0 scroing spree in the first 10 minutes, ending the first half 18-11 thanks to their superiority and maturity.

In the second half, Angola's Romanian coach made tactic changes to test the defensive skills of the hosts, who managed to hold on their advantages for eventual victory.
