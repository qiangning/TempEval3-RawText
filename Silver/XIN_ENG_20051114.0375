German coach for Greece's National Football team Otto Rehhagel on Monday announced to continue as the Greek national team's head coach for another two years.

The announcement ends speculation that the veteran coach would leave the Euro 2004 champions for another national or Bundesliga side following Greece's failure to qualify for the World Cup 2006 competition in Germany.

During a joint press conference with the Greek Football Federation, he expressed that the devoted players and passionate Greek fans are behind his decision to stay on.

"Never before in my career have the fans and players wanted me to stay on after a team of mine was eliminated," said the coach, who was passionately called as King Otto by his followers in Greece.

"We talked a great deal to the players, and all of the team members asked me to stay," he added.

He also expressed his volition to reward his fans and the Greek public.

"We owe the European championship to the players, and I need to give something back to them; to stay on and continue," said Rehhagel, adding that the team's target is now Euro 2008.

A poll, taken hours after his side failing to qualify for World Cup 2006, showed 88 percent of Greeks were in favor of him staying on.

"The renewal of our cooperation is something all of Greece has been waiting for," said Greek Football Federation president Vassilis Gagatsis.

"We want Otto Rehhagel. We made an early offer because we believe he will once again lead us where all Greeks hope to go."

According to reports, Rehhagel's contract will be worth roughly 800,000 euros a year.
