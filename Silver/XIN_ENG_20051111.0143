Chinese Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan Thursday highlighted the prospecting of petroleum and gas as an important task of geological survey work.

Efforts should focus on prospecting of strategic mineral resources, especially oil, natural gas, uranium, iron, copper and aluminium, Zeng said at a conference on geological work held by the State Council in Taiyuan, capital of northwest China's Shanxi Province.

Zeng stressed the importance of the geological survey work, considering it key to easing the impact of resource shortages on economic growth.

He noted that major projects in geological surveying should be launched in accordance with the overall layout of national economic and social development. Enterprises are encouraged to take part in mineral prospecting.

He urged to continue the comprehensive survey and assessment of the geological environment in key economic zones and mineral belts.
