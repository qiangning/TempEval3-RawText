A passenger coaster plunged into a river in the earthquake-hit Pakistan-controlled Kashmir on Sunday, killing several people, according to a TV report.

Geo TV reported that around 50 people were traveling in the coaster when the accident happened at Chalbani town, some 8 kilometers from Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.

The TV earlier reported that 10 people died in the hospital.

The coaster fell down in the Neelam river when it was taking a turn on a bridge.

The coaster has the seating capacity of 25 people, but some 45 to 50 people were on board when the accident occurred.

Ambulances of the aid groups, busy in the quake-relief activities in the region, rushed to the site of the accident and started shifting the injured to local hospitals.

Reports said that majority of the passengers were local survivors in the Oct. 8 devastating earthquake and were going to Muzaffarabad to meet relatives, who are living in tents established for survivors.
