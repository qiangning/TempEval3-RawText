An elected MP of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) has been sentenced to four years in prison for alleged medical malpractice, a senior party official said Saturday.

Doctor Than Aung, an MP for a Rangoon township was sentenced Friday for running an unlicensed clinic and causing the death of a patient through negligence. He has been sent to the capital's notorious Insein prison.

Speaking by telephone from Rangoon, NLD joint vice-chairman, Tin Oo said the negligence charge was "fabricated" and noted that Than Aung had been a practising doctor for 25 years.

"He's a member of the NLD and a member of parliament. The authorities are continuing to act oppressively against our league," he said of the verdict.

The NLD swept the last general elections to be held in military-run Burma in 1990, the results of which were never recognised by the ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).

The sentencing of Than Aung follows lighter treatment earlier this month of another NLD MP and doctor, Than Nyein, who was released from custody and ordered to pay a small fine for operating a clinic without a license.

Observers in the Burmese capital speculated that he was granted favourable treatment because he was brother-in-law of Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, the SLORC first secretary and military intelligence chief.

The cases of the two NLD doctors are the first time that members of the pro-democracy party have been granted a formal trial, with opportunity to have defence witnesses.

Previously, NLD members found guilty of even a minor law violation have been given arbitrary sentences ranging from three to seven years.

Tin Oo declined to speculate on whether Than Nyein had been granted leniency because of the family connection, but noted that the judicial system in Burma "is not independent and according to due process of law."

He said that the NLD would appeal against the sentencing of Than Aung to the high court, and if necessary, to the supreme court and to the chairman of the SLORC.
