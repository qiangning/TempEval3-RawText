The leader of Hong Kong's Catholics Friday condemned China for ordaining a bishop without papal approval and urged Beijing to work towards restoring ties with the Vatican.

In a strongly worded statement, Cardinal Joseph Zen described the ordination of Wang Renlei, 36, as Bishop of Xuzhou in the eastern province of Jiangsu, as "illegitimate".

"It is hard to understand how there can be people who obstinately work for destruction," the outspoken Zen said.

"Under the cloak of serving the Church, they work to destroy her unity."

Zen, 74, said China's move showed "how those with vested interests are terribly afraid that the Church one day may operate normally and freely according to her constitution."

China's state-run Catholic Church Thursday ordained Wang Renlei, 36, as Bishop of Xuzhou in the eastern province of Jiangsu. He became the fourth bishop ordained in China this year without the blessing of the Vatican.

China installed new bishops Ma Yinglin on April 30 in Anhui province, and Liu Xinhong in Yunnan province on May 3 despite Vatican objections, in a move seen as further damaging relations between the Holy See and Beijing.

On May 14, Zhan Silu was ordained a bishop in southwestern China's Fujian province.

Zen, who leads 250,000 Catholics here, said the latest ordination was a "very serious offence".

He chastised China for going back on its promise to a Vatican delegation not to ordain any more bishops without papal approval.

"In order to achieve their purpose, the methods they used this time are not only threat, allurement and deceit, but also forceful abduction and kidnapping!" said Zen.

He was apparently referring to a report by the Vatican-based AsiaNews agency that two Chinese bishops recognised by the Holy See, Li Liangui and Peter Feng Xinmao, were forced to take part in the ordination ceremony.

The Shanghai-born Zen made an appeal to the Chinese leaders and "begged" them to start a dialogue with the Holy See to restore diplomatic ties that were cut in 1951, prompting the Vatican to switch recognition to Taiwan.

"We beg you to make a firm decision to start a substantial dialogue with the Holy See, to find a way acceptable to both, the State and the Holy See, so that the Church in our country may operate normally and the faithful may be happy to offer themselves and contribute to the real good of our country," he said.

Since becoming pope last year, Benedict XVI has sought to improve ties with Beijing in an effort to get closer to millions of Chinese Catholics, but the consecrations have been seen as a setback to those efforts.

China's state-sanctioned church, which does not answer to the pope, has about four million worshippers, official figures show. The Vatican estimates the country's underground Catholic church has around 10 million followers.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu on Thursday reaffirmed China's policy of independence from the Vatican.

She reiterated that to re-establish ties, the Vatican must sever ties with Taiwan and not interfere with its internal affairs. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification.
