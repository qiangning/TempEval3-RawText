The US House of Representatives backed a resolution Friday asserting that the Palestinain Islamist movement Hamas should not be allowed to participate in Palestinian elections.

The resolution, which said that Hamas should not be permitted to participate in Palestinian polls until it recognizes "Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state," was approved by a voice vote of 397 to 17 with seven abstentions.

Hamas scored a resounding victory Friday in local elections in the main West Bank cities in what was one of the clearest indicators of the Palestinain Islamist movement's strength ahead of January's parliamentary contest.

According to preliminary results provided by a senior election official, Hamas was savouring victory in three of the West Bank's four major cities, while rival Fatah was left licking its wounds following a week of violence and bitter divisions which nearly split the dominant party.

The results are expected to bode well for Hamas ahead of the January 25 parliamentary election.

The US congressional resolution also urged Hamas -- which is designated a terrorist group by the US State Department -- to "permanently disarm and dismantle their terrorist infrastructure."
