Explosives strapped to a donkey were detonated near a German aid agency's vehicle in northern Afghanistan but the blast caused no human casualties, police said Thursday.

The explosives, stuffed into a pressure cooker strapped to the donkey's back, detonated near the car belonging to the aid group in Faizabad, capital of northeastern Badakhshan province, police commander Shah Jahan Noori said.

He blamed the attack, which took place Wednesday, on "terrorist organisations who do not want Afghanistan's stability".

"We're investigating whether it was a remote-controlled bomb or one of those time bombs," Noori told AFP.

The car of the aid group, GTZ, was slightly damaged in the explosion.

While the police chief did not name any particular group for the blast, most bombings in Afghanistan are blamed on remnants of the ousted Taliban regime although they occur largely in the insurgency-hit south and east.

It appeared to be the first time a donkey was used to carry out an attack since the Taliban launched an insurgency against the new US-backed government.

Insurgents in Iraq have used the animals to pull a cart from which rockets were fired.

Noori said an investigation into the bombing would reveal if the use of donkeys was a new tactic of the Taliban, who frequently use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in their attacks.

"An investigation has been launched. We will in future check donkeys laden with suspicious items," he said.

The animals are plentiful in mountainous Badakhshan.

The Taliban were overthrown in a US-led invasion in four years ago and are trying to claw their way back into power with regular but usually small-scale attacks on government and foreign forces, and groups allied with the administration, including aid organisations.

There has been an increase in the number of bombings blamed on the Taliban, with about 10 suicide attacks since late September which analysts say suggest the militants are adopting some of the techniques used by insurgents in Iraq.

The latest was in a mosque in the main northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif Wednesday which caused no casualties besides the bomber. It was unclear if the attacker was linked to the Taliban and other insurgents, or driven by personal enmity.
