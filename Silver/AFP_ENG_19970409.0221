Prime Minister Romano Prodi told the Italian parliament Wednesday that if his government loses a vote on sending troops to Albania he would put its future in the hands of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

Prodi made the statement at the start of a day-long debate on Italy's planned leadership of a multinational force to protect aid supplies to Albania.

The Refounded Communists, allies of the government in parliament, have withdrawn their support ahead of the vote on the force for Albania.

"If the opposition of the Refounded Communists continues I will immediately go to the head of state to officially inform him of the situation, and leave the decision up to him," Prodi said.
