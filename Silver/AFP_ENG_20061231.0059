All is ready for Slovenia to at midnight on New Year's Sunday become the first former Communist state to adopt the European Union's common currency, officials here said.

Five years after euro bills and coins were introduced, almost three years after Slovenia acceded to the EU, and 15 years after Slovenia declared independence from the former Yugoslavia, a new stage in the East-West integration of Europe is to be reached on January 1.

"We are replacing something good (the Slovenian currency, the tolar) with something even better (the euro)," Slovenian Finance Minister Andrej Bajuk said on Friday as he announced that preparations for the changeover had concluded.

As of January 1, the euro will replace the tolar, a currency introduced in 1991 as a symbol of the tiny country's independence and an instrument aimed at cutting Belgrade's monetary control over the Slovenian economy.

Under the exchange rate, one euro will equal 239.64 tolars.

"The euro isn't important only for our economy, we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the EU and this will give (citizens) confidence," Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa told AFP in a recent interview.

The accession to the eurozone is a coup for Slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries -- eight former Communist states plus Malta and Cyprus -- that joined in 2004 to have met the tough Maastricht criteria on public finances, inflation, interest and exchange rates that are required for eurozone newcomers.

After EU finance ministers gave Slovenia the green light last July to join the euro, the government and central bank had to carry out wide preparations for the switch, such as minting Slovenian euro coins and distributing bills to banks.

"I believe we are well-prepared," central bank governor Mitja Gaspari said on Friday.

"There will be no trouble concerning cash in circulation," Gaspari said.

He said the central bank planned to put into circulation around one billion euros (1.3 billion dollars) in bills and coins to replace the 215 billion tolars (some 900 million euros) currently circulating in the two-million-population central European state.

Banks will be closed from December 30-January 3, with the exception of 52 bank offices in 42 cities and towns that will open on January 1 and 2 to change tolars into euros.

The changeover to the single European currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of January.

To prevent a rounding upward of prices as has happened when other nations changed over to the euro, the government introduced last March the double labelling of prices, in euros and tolars, and this will remain in force for six months.

Despite this measure, inflation in December increased by 0.4 percent from the previous month pushing 12-month inflation, in unadjusted terms, to end at 2.8 percent, compared to 2.3 percent registered in December 2005.

But Gaspari said: "We can't blame the euro for any increase of prices in December, January or February, and there is no justification for any raising of prices."

Slovenia's Consumer Association reported on Friday that during the last week before the changeover prices in some fast-food restaurants of capital Ljubljana increased between six and 20 percent and prices for parking in the center of the city are also expected to rise.

Another problem Slovenian banks will face on New Year's Eve will be the switch to euros on 1,300 ATMs (automatic teller machines). These are expected to be out of use during the transition for only three hours (between 9 pm and midnight).

Meanwhile, Cyprus and Malta are expected to follow Slovenia into the eurozone in 2008 and Slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009.

The Czech Republic is now aiming to join the euro in 2012 and Hungary in 2013.
