Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien on Wednesday filed an expected challenge against a judicial inquiry which blamed him for a notorious corruption scandal.

Justice John Gomery was biased against him and Gomery's conclusion was not backed up by the information given at the inquiry, Chretien said in his appeal.

Wednesday is the last day of a 30-day limit that Chretien could file the challenge in a Federal Court since the release of the Gomery report. In his initial investigation report released on Nov. 1, Gomery confirmed a system of illegal kickbacks and contributions that funneled millions of dollars to the federal Liberal Party in Quebec.

He described Chretien as the architect of the program, and his chief of staff Jean Pelletier as the man who implemented it. And Prime Minister Paul Martin, then Chretien's finance minister, was exonerated of any wrongdoing over the scandal.

Chretien's appeal came when Martin launched his Quebec election campaign on Wednesday with a star candidate astronaut Marc Garneau who was asking Quebecers to turn the page on the sponsorship scandal.

The Liberal popularity in Quebec was hit most hard by the scandal which led to the defeat of Martin's minority government on Monday by a non-confidence vote in the House of Commons.

However, Chretien's associates said that the timing of the appeal was linked to the time limit yet has nothing to do with the election.
