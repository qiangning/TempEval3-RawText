Thai share prices rebounded Wednesday after the military-installed government was forced to dump draconian capital controls that sparked a 15-percent collapse on Tuesday, dealers said.

The rebound helped the region as a whole recover from Tuesday's shock when Thailand, trying to protect export earnings from a rising baht, required 30 percent of most incoming foreign funds to be effectively impounded for a year.

The move spooked investors fearful that other regional countries with similar concerns over their export-led economies, might adopt similar measures to Thailand, the epicentre of the devastating 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.

"Foreign investors cheered the government's decision to backtrack on the currency rules," said Sukit Udomsirikul, a senior market analyst at Siam City Securities.

"With the change, foreign investors can continue to invest in the Thai stockmarket. Sentiment is really positive," Sukit said, suggesting stocks could recover the 690 points level.

Amid calls for heads to roll over the debacle, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) composite index was up 66.03 points or 10.61 percent in the morning session at 688.17. The market lost 15 percent Tuesday, at 23 billion dollars the biggest one day drop by value in the 31-year history of the bourse.

Despite the losses, central bank governor Tarisa Watanagase defended the capital controls Wednesday and rejected calls for her resignation.

"I don't want to answer this question," Tarisa said when asked by reporters about growing calls for her replacement.

She took the helm of the central bank in October after Pridiyathorn Devakula left the job to join the government as finance minister.

Tarisa, the first woman to head the central bank, also reassured investors that the Bank of Thailand had no plans to introduce new currency rules for now.

"The Bank of Thailand will not issue any new measure for some peroid of time," she said.

Pridiyathorn, who was forced to backtrack on the capital controls late Tuesday after the stock plunge, said he was pleased with the rebound Wednesday.

"We may not recover all of the 108 points but I am happy to see a 65-point rebound with some 500 billion baht of market capitalisation being recovered," he told reporters.

While the local press lambasted the disaster, with some blaming Pridiyathorn for the worst economic woes since the 1997 financial crisis, the finance minister insisted the measures were necessary to prevent the baht's further rise.

"If the central bank did nothing (on Monday), we could have seen the baht rising to 34 to the dollar and hurt our exporters' competitiveness," Pridiyathorn said.

The Thai baht, which hit a new nine-year high of 35.12 to the dollar on Monday, was at 35.67-70 in late early Wednesday trade.

Krungthep Thurakit, a leading business daily, said someone in the government, which came to power after a coup in September that ousted the business savvy premier Thaksin Shinawatra, should take responsibility.

"It was the most expensive economic lesson for Thailand since the financial crisis in 1997 and someone must take responsibility for this lesson," the financial daily said in an editorial.

Effective Tuesday, the central bank, under the supervision of the finance ministry, had ordered financial institutions to hold 30 percent of foreign inflows, except those related to exports.

If incoming funds were kept in Thailand for a year, the depositor would get all their money back but if they withdrew earlier, then they would not.

Tuesday's record losses in Bangkok were an unwelcome echo of the Asian financial crisis which was sparked when the government was forced to float the baht in July 1997 in a bid to bolster the country's then flagging exports.

The baht promptly crashed, took the Thai economy with it and sent a tidal wave of debt and default sweeping across the region which cost billions of dollars to put right.

The impact was so great that it has taken years for many regional stockmarkets to revisit pre-crisis levels. Despite recent gains, Thailand's own bourse still remains far below its all-time high of 1,753.73 in January 1994.
