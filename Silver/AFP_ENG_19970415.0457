The UN Human Rights Commission on Tuesday condemned the killings of Iranian opposition figures and called for legal action to be taken against the killers.

The call came five days after a German court implicated Iranian leaders in the killing of four Iranian Kurd opposition figures in a Berlin restaurant in 1982.

A motion presented by the Netherlands representing the European Union called on Tehran to "refrain from violence against members of the Iranian opposition living abroad."

Passed by 26 votes to 7 with 19 abstentions, it also urged Tehran to cooperate with the authories of countries investigating the killings.

Turning to the death sentence, or fatwa, issued by the Iranian authorities against British author Salman Rushdie for his allegedly blasphemous novel "The Satanic Verses," the Commission demanded that Iran "provide satisfactory written assurances that it does not support or incite threats to the life of Mr Rushdie."

It deplored a recent decision by an Iranian foundation to increase the reward offered to an eventual killer of Rushdie from 2 million to 2.5 million dollars.

Last Thursday an Iranian and a Lebanese were given life sentences by a Berlin court after being convicted of the assassination of four Iranian Kurd opposition figures on the direct orders of the Iranian regime.

The presiding judge said "the background (to the killings) reaches to the highest levels of the Iranian state."
