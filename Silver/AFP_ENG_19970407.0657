Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said his ministry would respond "appropriately" to the dollar's gains against the yen, hinting at measures to check the US unit's rapid rise to a 51-month high.

The impact of an excessively low yen is the same as the impact of an excessively strong yen, Mitsuzuka told a regular press conference.

"Our stance in the February G7 meeting was to respond appropriately to the dollar's gains, and that an excessively low yen means (the same as) an excessively high yen" in terms of the adverse impact, Mitsuzuka said.

"We will take the same stance in line with this policy," he said.

The dollar was quoted at 125.74-76 yen in Tokyo at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), up from 124.68-71 yen late Monday and in line with 125.73 yen in New York late Monday.

The dollar climbed to as high as 125.85 yen here Tuesday, the highest level since January 18, 1993, when the US unit hit 125.86 yen.

"The dollar is likely to test the upper limit today, with the psychological ceiling seen at around 126.20 yen," a dealer at a European bank said.

"The dollar's advance since last Friday is too fast, but the US unit is supported by a wide gap between US and Japanese interest rates," he said.

"Japanese investments in foreign bonds will be unstoppable for the time being, resulting in a higher dollar.

More political leaders in Japan are likely to voice concern over the higher dollar, as the financial authorities are uncomfortable with the US unit at above 125 yen," he said.
