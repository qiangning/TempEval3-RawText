Bayern Munich have confirmed their participation in a lucrative four-team tournament in Dubai from January 5-14.

The German champions will be on a six-week winter break from the Bundesliga but have been given the chance to keep trim against some quality opposition over the festive period, and make some money into the bargain.

Bayern will face Portuguese side Benfica on January 8 with the winner facing Brazilian giants FC Santos or Italian outfit Lazio for the two million dollar prize money.

Bayern vice-chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said: "We didn't have the best preparation in the summer but now we've found what we have been looking for for the past three years - two serious matches in the winter break that combine our sporting and economic interests."

Bayern lie fourth in the Bundesliga table, three points behind joint leaders Werder Bremen and Schalke 04, with just one game remaining before the winter break.

The Bundesliga resumes on January 26, with Dortmund's home game against Bayern kicking off the second half of the season.
