Chelsea striker Didier Drogba admitted he has a soft spot for the League Cup after dumping Newcastle out of the competition in the quarter-finals.

Drogba scored with a superb free-kick just 11 minutes from full-time at St James' Park on Wednesday to seal a 1-0 win that kept Chelsea's bid to win all four major trophies on course.

The Ivory Coast star, who had also hit the winner against Newcastle in the Premiership last week, knows all about League Cup glory after scoring in Chelsea's 2005 final win over Liverpool.

That victory was Drogba's first taste of success in English football and, with Chelsea through to the last four, he is determined to savour the winning feeling again.

"Everyone knows how important this competition is to me because it was my first trophy in England and I scored in the final," Drogba said.

"The team want to win every game because we want to be champions again and to win this trophy."

Drogba has been suffering from a thigh injury recently but he came on for the lacklustre Andriy Shevchenko with 17 minutes left and made an instant impact.

Nicky Butt fouled Arjen Robben and Drogba stepped up to curl the free-kick past Shay Given for his 17th goal this season.

He is in the form of his life after grabbing the decisive goal in each of Chelsea's last three matches, but he put that impressive run down to the hard work of his team-mates.

"Sometimes you have a good period like this," Drogba said. "But if I score it is because everyone is doing a good job and maybe their defence is tired. Sheva, Salomon Kalou and Arjen all did well.

"I am giving my best and I think everyone is happy with me not just because I am scoring goals but also because I am working for the team.

"It is difficult to come on as a substitute because the pace is very high in the English game.

"Frank Lampard came on and made a difference as well and so did Michael Ballack. It's very important to have a strong bench for different competitions."

Newcastle were unlucky not to take the lead in the first half when Obafemi Martins' long-range shot cannoned off the crossbar and onto the goal-line.

The assistant referee ruled the ball had not crossed the line and Drogba came on to make Glenn Roeder's side pay for failing to turn their possession into goals.

Roeder said: "We were doing more than holding them in the first half and had some good chances. I thought the boys were fantastic."

Chelsea were joined in the last four by Tottenham after Jermain Defoe's extra-time winner earned a 1-0 win against Southend at White Hart Lane.

Southend goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan produced a string of fine saves to take the tie into an additional 30 minutes.

But England striker Defoe pounced from close range as he just beat the offside trap to tap-in Mido's cross in the 115th minute.

League Two Wycombe had shocked struggling Premiership side Charlton on Tuesday as Jermaine Easter's goal clinched a 1-0 win at The Valley.

Liverpool will play Arsenal in the last quarter-final on January 9 after their match on Tuesday was postponed due to heavy fog.
