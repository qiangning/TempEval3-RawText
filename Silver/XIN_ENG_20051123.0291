Mortgage rates in the United States declined this week after having increased for 10 consecutive weeks, mortgage giant Freddie Mac reported Wednesday in its weekly nationwide survey.

During the week ending Nov. 23, rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.28 percent, the survey showed. That was down sharply from last week's rate of 6.37 percent, the highest level in more than two years.

The survey also showed that rates on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages, a popular choice for refinancing a home mortgage, fell to 5.81 percent this week from 5.90 percent.

Meanwhile, rates on one-year adjustable rate mortgages(ARMs) dropped to 5.14 percent from 5.20 percent last week. Rates on five- year hybrid adjustable rate mortgages went down to 5.75 percent from 5.86.

A year ago, 30-year mortgages averaged 5.72 percent, 15-year mortgages were at 5.15 percent and one-year ARMs averaged 4.27 percent. Freddie Mac began tracking five-year ARMs this year.

Analysts say that mortgage rates declined this week because investors had been less worried about inflation than before.

"Lower oil prices -- at least compared to the last several months -- have helped to alleviate some of the inflation fears that the market has been experiencing lately," Freddie Mac's chief economist Frank Nothaft said.
