Switzerland's second largest bank, Credit Suisse, reported on Wednesday a better-than-expected rise in its third-quarter figures, with net profit up 42 percent to 1.9 billion Swiss francs (1.48 billion US dollars).

Business for both its investment and its private bank sectors had boomed due to continued strong growth and confidence in global financial markets, according to Credit Suisse.

The surprisingly good result follows a drop in net profits in the second quarter to 919 million Swiss francs (716 million dollars).

"Our group benefited from increased levels of client activity and the active market environment," said Credit Suisse CEO, Oswald Grubel, commenting on the third quarter results.

Like its larger rival, UBS, Credit Suisse has large private banks and substantial investment banking operations, with retail banking limited to Switzerland.

Credit Suisse, which is based in Zurich, Switzerland, and has total assets under management of 1.405 trillion Swiss francs (1.1 trillion dollars), is active in about 50 countries and employs more than 60,000 people, with 26,000 of them in Switzerland.
