Egypt's Electoral Commission has announced the final results of the first phase of the three-stage parliamentary elections, the Egyptian Gazette daily reported on Thursday.

Thirty-one seats were decided by the ballot held on Nov. 9 with the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) garnering 26 seats, the Muslim Brotherhood four seats, and another going to an independent, according to the commission.

The run-off for 133 seats was held on Tuesday and the NDP, led by President Hosni Mubarak, won 42 seats, the commission announced late Wednesday.

The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's de facto largest opposition group, won 30 seats, the independents won 54 and opposition parties won eight, it added.

The first phase of Egypt's three-stage parliamentary election was held in 82 constituencies across eight governorates, including the capital Cairo.

The second and third stages will be held on Nov. 20 and Dec. 1 respectively. Any run-offs, if necessary, will be held six days after each round of voting.
