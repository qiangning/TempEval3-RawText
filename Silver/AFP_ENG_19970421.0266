A long-running saga over India's national budget edged towards its climax Monday when India's newly-elected United Front coalition government pledged to push the tax-cutting proposals through at the end of the month.

Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, sworn into office earlier in the day, told a government committee meeting here that the widely acclaimed budget, proposed by the previous Front coalition, would be re-introduced on April 30.

It is likely to become law a few days after that date.

The budget was unveiled at the end of February by the previous United Front coalition headed by H.D. Deve Gowda. The government, however, was voted out of office before the finance bill could be ratified.

Its proposed measures won widespread support both from industry and political parties.

But India's stock markets and industry feared they could die with Deve Gowda, particularly if new general elections were called.

Gujral's rise to power, however, at the head of a virtual carbon-copy of the previous Front administration backed by Congress, ensured the measures would go through.

Ironically, the architect of the budget, former finance mininster Palaniappan Chidambaram, will not be at the helm when the budget debate begins.

He has been forced to quit his post after his regional party decided to withdraw from the new United Front government.

His budget slashed taxes, widened the tax net and promised to reduce the fiscal deficit. Personal taxes were cut from 40 to 30 percent and corporate taxes from 40 to 35 percent.
