The Netherlands indicated Wednesday it was definitively halting efforts to save bankrupt aviation group Fokker, following the recent withdrawal of the main industrial support for a Fokker relaunch plan.

On April 4, Dutch industrial group Stork said it could not accept the "last chance" scenario presented to it for rescuing the group, thus condemning the plan to failure.

In a letter Wednesday to the Chamber of Deputies, economic affairs minister Hans Wijers said he has reached the "bitter conclusion" that there were "no further prospects" for restoring the Fokker activities.

Hence the state is no longer willing to invest, even though it is still prepared to provide technical support for further efforts by Belgian investor Andre Deleye, who said Saturday that he still had some hope of finding some parties to take over Fokker.

Wijers praised the substantial efforts made by Deleye Investment Group, regretting that no industrial companies or groups had wanted to join in the initiative.
