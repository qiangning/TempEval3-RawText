European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso slammed new EU budget proposals by the bloc's British presidency as "unacceptable" and unfair to its poorer new member states.

Speaking shortly after the new plans were unveiled in London, he slammed them as a "minimalist" proposal which could only fund a "mini Europe" rather than the EU including 10 new mostly ex-communist states which joined last year.

"As it is the UK presidency proposal is unacceptable. It is simply not realistic. This proposal amounts to a budget for a 'mini Europe', not the strong Europe that we need," he said.

"It has not yet struck the right balance between the member states. In particular the propsals needs to become fairer for new member states," he added.

The British proposals are aimed at breaking a budget deadlock in time for an EU summit in Brussels next week.

The main stumbling blocks have been Britain's refusal to surrender its long-cherished rebate, and French resistance to calls for reform of generous farm subsidies.

In the new proposals, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government pledged to forgo eight billion euros of its EU rebate in 2007-13 to help cover the cost of enlargement. In addition funds for the new EU member states would be cut.

Barroso said there was a contradiction between wanting the EU to play a bigger global role while cutting its funding.

"Some people say ... 'we need a Europe with ambition in terms of trade, in terms of dimension, in terms of competitiveness'. But afterwards when it comes to the financial means there is no ambition at all.

"There is a contradiction there," he said.
