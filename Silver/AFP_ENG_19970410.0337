France must inform the European Commission of how it plans to recover some 500 million francs of illegal state aid to textile producers and could face action in the European Court if it fails to do so, commission officials said Thursday.

The warning came the day after Brussels rejected a French plan to boost employment in its textile industries by cutting payroll taxes, judging the scheme to be an indirect state subsidy that would give French companies an unfair competitive edge over other EU producers.

French Industry Minister Frank Borotra has said he has no intention of asking companies to pay back an amount equivalent to what they gained from the scheme.

Some 500 French companies have received aid with a value above 100,000 ecus (114,000 dollars) -- the threshold at which the approval of Brussels is required for any state subsidy.

The commission said on Wednesday when it rejected the textile plan that it would consider a broader job-creating scheme on condition this was not confined to one sector.
