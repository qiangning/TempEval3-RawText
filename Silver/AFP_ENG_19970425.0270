A US-based Christian relief group, just back from famine-hit North Korea, appealed here Friday for prompt food aid to save the Stalinist state but questioned its lavish spending on state memorials.

Dean Hirsch, president of World Vision, told a news conference here that unless food aid reaches North Korea's 2.4 million children under age six within the next 30-60 days "the future of North Korea is very grim."

"We must respond now. We are running out of time. If North Korea does not receive massive humanitarian assistance between now and July, it will be too late," Hirsch said.

Hirsch said, "we saw only two dogs during the entire trip. Through our conversations with our guide, we were convinced that most of the animals, including pet dogs, had been eaten."

His mission returned Thursday from a five-day visit to North Korea, hit by two years of floods, with video and still pictures of the devastatation and starvation.

World Vision claims to work in 103 countries including North Korea where it has provided 4.2 million dollars in food aid, seeds and medicines since 1995.

But Hirsch's group also watched Pyongyang's week-long preparations for Friday's "massive celebration" marking the founding of its million- strong military.

"I could not help but wonder how this major event would be seen by the people in the light of the scarcity of food in the country," he said.

Hirsch also noted he saw some 50,000 children from 30 schools taking part in mass gymnastics last Sunday, as part of ceremonies marking the 85th birthday of the late president Kim Il-Sung.

However, he said he was convinced that massive starvation would take place within 90 days based on government accounts that children had been surviving on only 100 grams 3.5 ounces of rice a day.

World Vision Vision along with the World Food Programme (WFP), a UN agency, were two of relief organizations appealing for a total of 126 million dollars worth of emergency aid to alleviate North Korea's acute food shortage.

Hirsh said that his group did not see starving children during their "limited visit."

In early April, North Korea said that 134 children died of malnutrition, an admission that belyed propaganda about the country of 20 million being the "workers paradise."
