The pro-senatorial poll faction of the Movement for Democratic Change, Zimbabwe's largest opposition, rebuffed leader Morgan Tsvangirai's claims that there was no quorum when the party suspended him on Sunday.

Faction spokesperson Gift Chimanikire said there was a quorum when the party barred Tsvangirai from all party activities.

"Only one person who was not well was not available when the quorum sat and as such Tsvangirai remains suspended from all party activities until such time when a decision about his future is taken," said Chimanikire.

Chimanikire said "he can go and hang. We held the disciplinary meeting in his absence because he disregarded it. We will soon give him the last chance to appear under the same disciplinary committee."

Should he fail to respond, Chimanikire said, this would be his last chance after which necessary measures would be taken.

He, however, refused to elaborate on the action Tsvangirai would face.

"He is barred from all party activities until further notice and should not represent the party in any capacity," he said.

Chimanikire said the latest move meant that Gibson Sibanda, the second in command, had assumed the presidency and overall control of the party.

He said that the faction would not attend the emergency meeting that Tsvangirai called.

"If he goes ahead with his decision, he will not get a quorum. This is what happened when he convened the last meeting."

He claimed that Tsvangirai's bodyguards were made members of the national council at this meeting.

Tsvangirai's spokesperson William Bango refused to comment on the latest developments.

"I don't comment on those issues. In fact I have no comment," Bango said.
