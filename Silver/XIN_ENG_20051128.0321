World 200-meter champions Justin Gatlin and Allyson Felix were named winners of the 2005 Jesse Owens Award by USA Track and Field in Indianapolis on Monday.

Gatlin, who swept both 100m and 200m in the World Outdoor Athletics Championships in Helsinki, captured the award for the second year in a row.

"To win this award again is simply amazing," said Gatlin who won the 100m in 9.88 seconds, winning by .17 of a second in the largest margin in World Championships history.

Gatlin thus matched Maurice Greene from 1999 as the only men to complete a 100-200 world sprint title sweep.

Felix, 19, won every race she entered and claimed her first world title in the 200m in 22.16 seconds, beating a field that included Olympic champion Veronica Campbell.

"I'm humbled to be chosen for this recognition," Felix said.

Felix, the only teen to claim a world sprint crown, also won the US outdoor title in a world-leading 22.13 seconds. She had the three fastest times in the world this year at 200m and five of the top seven.
