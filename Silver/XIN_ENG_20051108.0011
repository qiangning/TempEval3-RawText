The Indonesian squad questioned the recent drawing of the International Badminton Federation (IBF), which could see early battles among Indonesian top shuttlers in the China Open badminton tournament, local media reports said Tuesday.

According to the drawing, Indonesia's top duo Candra Wijaya/Sigit Budiarto could face compatriots Flandy Limpele/Eng Hian if both pairs made it to the second round, said the Media Indonesia daily.

The drawing, released in the IBF official website, may also see all Indonesian affairs in the third round between Sony Dwi Kuncoro and Simon Santoso in men's singles and Markis Kido/Hendra Setiawan and Luluk Hadiyanto/Alven Yulianto in men's doubles.

"We will send a letter to the IBF (to ask) why many our players meet in the early stages," head of Indonesian coaching team Rudy Hartono was quoted as saying.
