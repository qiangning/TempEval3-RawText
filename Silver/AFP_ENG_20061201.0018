China plans to apply to host the 2014 World Cup as part of its efforts to continue attracting major international sporting events following the 2008 Beijing Olympics, state press said Friday.

"Following the 2008 Beijing Olympics, our plan is to apply to host the 2011 World Swimming Championships and the 2014 World Cup," the Beijing Times quoted Sun Kanglin, head of the Beijing Sports Bureau as saying.

No other details of the bid were made available.

Soccer's ruling body FIFA has already announced that World Cup 2014, although a formal vote to determine the tournament hosts will be made at the FIFA Congress in 2008.

Even if China has no chance for 2014, any potential bid could pave the way for the Asian nation to host a later World Cup event.

China participated in the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea for the first-time-ever, but failed to qualify for the 2006 edition in Germany.

Under FIFA's policy of rotating the World Cup between continents, South America is guaranteed the right to host the 2014 finals, and Brazil has long been regarded as the front-runner.

Argentina and Chile could co-host the 2014 World Cup if Brazil was incapable of staging the greatest event in football, FIFA President Sepp Blatter was quoted as saying in April.

China is fast gaining a reputation as being able to hold major world sporting events ahead of Beijing's hosting of the 2008 Olympics.

The city has already won wide praise from International Olympic Committee chiefs for its preparations for 2008, while test events for the Games this year went smoothly.

China also already hosts major golf, tennis and motor racing events.
