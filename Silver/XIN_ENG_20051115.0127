Turnover totaled 16.11 billion HK dollars, down from 17.1 billion HK dollars Monday.

Property shares fell. Sun Hung Kai Properties slipped 0.5 percent to 72.3 HK dollars while Henderson Land Development lost 0. 4 percent to 34.75 HK dollars.

Mid-tier developer New World Development fell 0.5 percent to 9.45 HK dollars and Sino Land dropped 2.4 percent to 8.25 HK dollars. The Hang Seng Properties sub-index shed 0.4 percent to 17,265.36.

HSBC Holdings also weighed on the benchmark share index, ending down 0.1 percent at 124.4 HK dollars.

The declines of HSBC and property stocks offset the slim gains of other index heavyweights.
