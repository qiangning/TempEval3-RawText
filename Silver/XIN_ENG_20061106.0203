The United States expressed sadness on Monday over the death of five-time Turkish prime minister Bulent Ecevit who died over the weekend at the age of 81.

"We were saddened to learn of the death of former prime minister Bulent Ecevit," State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said at a briefing.

"His commitment to Turkey's secular democratic institutions was something that we very much respected and, I think, was respected throughout the world," Casey said.

Ecevit, whose final term in office ended in 2002, was once a strong U.S. ally.
