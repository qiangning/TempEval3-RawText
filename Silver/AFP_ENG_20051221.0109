The German Federal Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a new trial over huge bonuses paid to executives in the takeover of telecoms giant Mannesmann, reversing acquittals by a lower court against six accused including the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann.

The case concerns allegations that the accused received big payments in exchange for giving their approval for the acquisition of Mannesmann by British telephone operator Vodafone in 2000.

A lower court had decided that the payments, although against Mannesmann's interests and therefore inadmissable under German stock law, did not amount to criminal abuse of confidence.

The case was seen as raising controversial issues of corporate governance and commission payments for performance.

A re-trial is considered by many observers to put the future of Ackermann at the head of Deutsche Bank in question.

As head of the bank, he counts as the most powerful private banker in Germany, but during the first trial he had to attend court twice a week for six months.
