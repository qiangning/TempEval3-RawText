China's Olympic diving champion Guo Jingjing was revelling Tuesday in becoming the most successful female diver in Asian Games history.

Guo, who has already announced she will retire after the Beijing Olympics, took the women's 3-metre synchronized springboard title here with Li Ting to add to the three golds from previous Asian Games.

"I have never thought about beating any record," said the 25-year-old, who is the reigning Olympic champion in the 3m springboard and 3m synchronised springboard and a multiple world champion.

"The Asian Games means a lot to me."

But Guo, whose private life has caused as much of a splash as her performances in the pool, will not defend her 3m springboard title here.

"I don't feel sorry for giving up a third consecutive title. I have competed a lot this year and I need a rest. I'd like younger teammates to have more chances," she said.

Her next goal is the world swimming championships in Melbourne in March.

"We have less than three months to go for the worlds, I hope to defend my titles there," she said.

The photogenic Guo started training in competitive diving at the age of seven, winning a place on the national team when she was 11, and has competed in three Olympic Games.

She hit the headlines last year when she was romantically linked with former diving team-mate Tian Liang. Tian was later thrown off the national team for pursuing too many commercial endorsements.

China has dominated the diving competition in Doha, winning all four titles so far.
