A senior Kuwaiti official said on Tuesday his country was ready to consider any proposal that might bolster the international oil market, Kuwait News Agency ( KUNA) reported.

Eissa al-Oun, Undersecretary of Kuwaiti Ministry of Energy and Oil, made the remarks in an interview with KUNA on the oil-rich Emirate's position towards the coming meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

The OPEC is set to discuss further measures to balance the global crude oil prices in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, in mid December.

According to KUNA, the average price of OPEC crude basket since the beginning of 2006 till the end of last week was 55.74 U.S. dollars per barrel (dpb), up from 50.64 dpb in 2005.

In October, OPEC's average price dropped to 54.97 dpb from 59. 34 dpb in September.

In the last ministerial meeting in Doha of Qatar last month, OPEC oil ministers decided to cut the cartel's daily crude oil output by 1.2 million barrels as of Nov. 1, without excluding possibility of further cut when necessary.
