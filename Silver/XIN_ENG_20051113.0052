The Pacific Rim leaders will send a "short but strong" political message at their annual gathering to bolster the stalled global trade talks, said South Korea's APEC Ambassador Kim Jong-hoo here Sunday

"We agree that the forthcoming APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting may be the last chance to provide impetus to the ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization in Hong Kong next month, " Kim Jong-hoo told a press conference after ending the two-day Concluding Senior Officials' Meeting (CSOM ) for 2005.

The senior officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC) forum have reached an understanding on sending the political message backing the WTO Doha Development Agenda, said the ambassador.

The wording of joint statement has not been finalized, but it will be "strong" and "powerful," said the APEC SOM chair.

The Doha Round of World Trade Organization negotiations, first introduced at the fourth WTO biannual ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar in 2001, collapsed in 2003 due to deep differences between the developed and developing members on market access, agriculture subsidies and tariff structures. The push by APEC leaders to keep the momentum going is seen as important because the region represents nearly half of the world trade.

But experts were not optimistic about the outcome of the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong next month.

"I don't think there is much hope for the Doha Round meeting in Hong Kong as there is no real movement on agricultural subsidies by the developed countries," Michel Yahuda, an expert on Asia- Pacific affairs at London School of Economics, told Xinhua.

In addition to advancing free trade, the two-day working-level meeting also focused on anti-corruption, natural disasters and steps to combat the potential bird flu pandemic.

APEC will hold a ministerial meeting on bird flu pandemic in Vietnam in the early part of next year and a symposium on containing the new contagious disease in China in April, said South Korea's APEC ambassador.

The APEC officials also agreed that member economies will come up with a model for the establishment of a free trade agreement by 2008, he added.

The statements prepared by the senior officials will be handed to the APEC ministers for discussion on Tuesday and Wednesday, before submitting to their leaders.

The CSOM is the final meeting of Senior Officials before the 17th APEC Ministerial Meeting on Nov. 15-16 and the 13th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting that will take place on Nov. 18-19.

APEC, established in 1989, currently has 21 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, China's Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam. The chairmanship rotates among members, with South Korea holding the chair this year.
