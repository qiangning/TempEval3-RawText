Burma's military authorities maintained extra security in the capital Wednesday ahead of Burmese new year festivities, when huge crowds will hit the streets just after widespread communal unrest.

Government offices are building makeshift platforms, known as "pandals," by streets to stage entertainment and to throw water at passers-by during the new year festival from April 13 to April 17.

But some key ministries have begun to dismantle platforms outside their offices that had already been assembled, indicating concern about crowd control during the normally rowdy public festival, witnesses said.

Tanks were stationed near the mayor's office, one of the three main pandals where senior officials and diplomats are welcomed to mingle, be blessed with water and view the performers and floats in various contests.

Unrest broke out in the central city of Mandalay last month, when Buddhist monks attacked Moslem properties that left a dozen mosques destroyed.

Some 150 monks have been disrobed, and 10 members of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) have been detained in connection with the attacks, a Mandalay resident told AFP.

Among those detained was Htin Gyaw, one of the NLD candidates elected in 1990 to a parliament never convened by the junta because the opposition party would have held over 80 percent of the seats.

Analysts say the military government has been targeting prominent NLD members recently in a wave of arrests under various charges.

Only sporadic incidents have been reported in Rangoon recently, but more than 100 monks were picked up for questioning last month after a flurry of stonings and vandalism aimed at mosques and Moslem houses.

First degree security alerts were said to have been imposed in Rangoon, Mandalay, Sittwe and two other cities.

Committees of senior monks, Islamic elders and government authorities have been formed to head off further troubles, officials said.

But tensions remained among the country's 400,000 monks, as grievances against the authorities, believed to have been behind the attacks have yet to be resolved, analysts said.
