South Korean and DPR Korean officials met on the sidelines of the East Asian Games for three hours on Tuesday, discussing a joint team to the 2006 Asian Games and 2008 Olympic Games.

"Two sides have reached consensus on sending a joint team to the Asian Games and the Olympics, but a lot of work needs to be done before the final decision is made," said a South Korean official who asked not to be named.
