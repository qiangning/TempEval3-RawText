The Zambian government has proposed 10,133 billion kwacha (about 2.5 billion US dollars) for the 2006 national budget, Saturday's The Post reported.

The newspaper cited the green paper on the 2006-2008 Medium Term Expenditure Framework as saying that total revenue and grants next year are projected to be 9,084 billion kwacha (or 2.3 billion dollars).

"Thus from the projected total revenues and the proposed expenditures for the period 2006-2008, the overall financing requirement is estimated to stand at 1,049 billion kwacha (about 262 million dollars) in 2006 or 2.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)," said Secretary to Treasury Situmbeko Musokotwane.

The 2006 budget represents an increase of 776 billion kwacha ( about 194 million dollars) from the 2005 budget which stood at 9, 357 billion kwacha (2.3 billion dollars).

Musokotwane projected that between 2006 and 2008 the government anticipated external financing for capital projects to reduce steadily.

"Approximately an average of 68.6 percent of the capital expenditures will be financed from external resources compared to the 85 percent in 2005-2007 period," Musokotwane stated.

"In 2006, the government proposes to spend 42 percent of the projected total expenditure on general public services," he said.

General public services include functions such as administration and operation of or support to the executive and legislative arms of government, administration of financial and fiscal affairs and services.

He further said the government has projected to spend 7.8 percent of the total expenditures in 2006 on defense.

Health is anticipated to take up 7.6 percent of the total expenditure in 2006 while education will consume 15.1 percent, according to Musokotwane.

Also in the 2006-2008 Expenditure Framework, the Zambian government further proposed a budget of 10,459 billion kwacha (2.6 billion dollars) for the year 2007 and 11,153 billion kwacha (2.8 billion dollars) for 2008.
