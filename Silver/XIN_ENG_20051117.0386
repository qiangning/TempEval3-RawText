Cambodia destroyed two C-125M (SA-3) surface-to-air missiles on Friday aimed to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists.

Meas Sophea, deputy commander-in-chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) and commander of the army, presided over the destruction ceremony. Some diplomats also attended the ceremony.

Meas Sophea said the destruction was ordered by Prime Minister Hun Sen in order to prevent them from falling into the hands of international terrorists

The 36 surface-to-air missiles were discovered recently at a military base. The Defense Ministry started destroying them at the RCAF Armor Center in Kompong Speu province on Oct. 25, and all have been destroyed by Friday.

The surface-to-air missiles developed by the former Soviet Union are fired from fixed-position launchers to destroy aircraft, cruise missiles and assault helicopters flying at low and medium altitude. Cambodia imported the missiles in 1980.

"We don't need to keep them because we are now at peace," Chao Pirun, director of the ministry's technical and materials department, said earlier.

Last year, RCAF destroyed all 233 of its shoulder-fired surface- to-air missiles with assistance from the US government.
