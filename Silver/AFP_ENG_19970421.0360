Former Australian health minister Carmen Lawrence has been charged with three counts of perjury, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported here Monday night.

The charges arise out of evidence Lawrence, one of Australia's best known female politicians, gave to a royal commission examining the circumstances surrounding a controversial petition tabled in the Western Australian state parliament in 1992. Lawyer Penny Easton, who was named in the petition, committed suicide four days after it was tabled.

Lawrence was premier of the state before entering federal politics.

The ABC reported Lawrence was deeply distressed by the decision to charge her and maintained she had done nothing wrong.

It quoted her as saying that since she was innocent she had every confidence of being vindicated in court.

Lawrence said she would stand down from her Labor Party's opposition front bench in Canberra but would not resign from parliament, it added.

A Western Australian state member of parliament, John Halden, has also been charged with one count of perjury arising from the royal commission, the report said.

Lawrence and Halden will appear at the Perth Court of Petty Sessions Thursday.

It was not clear whether Lawrence had been arrested or charged by summons and no further details were immediately available.
