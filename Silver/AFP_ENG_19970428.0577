The top policy-making body of the IMF Monday ordered a broad study of the implications of European Monetary Union (EMU) for the world monetary system.

The committee, grouping finance ministers and central bankers of 24 countries representing the entire IMF membership said in a statement it "welcomed the progress made toward establishing conditions for EMU."

It said the creation of EMU was "one of the most important international monetary developments in the post-Bretton Woods period."

The statement said the IMF's Executive Board "will undertake a broad programme to assess the implications of EMU for the international monetary system and for the Fund."

IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus earlier told the committee that IMF surveillance of the new euro area, due to come into being in 1999, would be "a challenge for the Fund" because of the weight in the monetary system of the countries likely to take part.
