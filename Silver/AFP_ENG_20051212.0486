The US State Department's coordinator on Iraq predicted Monday a high turnout in this week's parliamentary election and said pre-poll violence had dropped sharply in recent days.

Washington also does not expect a new Iraqi government to ask for the withdrawal of US troops "any time in the near future," James Jeffrey told a briefing at the Foreign Press Center here.

Jeffrey spoke ahead of the election Thursday for Iraq's first permanent legislature of the post-Saddam Hussein era, a milestone US officials hope will undermine the Iraqi insurgency and allow American troops to pull out.

Dismissing concern that minority Sunni Muslims would stay away from the polls, Jeffrey said, "I do believe that there will be a very high turnout from all groups in the country.

"We hope, but cannot guarantee, that violence will be down, but I believe that even if the level of violence were to spike, that the Iraqi people ... will in large numbers go and vote."

Jeffrey gave no figure for predicted turnout. About 59 percent of eligible Iraqis cast ballots last January for an interim parliament, and 64 percent voted in the October 15 referendum on a new constitution.

The US envoy said that unlike the runup to January's ballot, "the level of violence has dropped my almost any measure over the past few days and we hope that that trend continues."

He gave no backup data but speculated this "might indicate that, particularly in some of the Sunni Arab areas, people are making a major commitment to vote, including among circles close to the insurgency."

Iraqi parties have started to make rumblings about a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops in Iraq, currently numbering some 160,000 for the election but expected to drop by 20,000 afterward.

Jeffrey repeated the US line that American forces would leave if asked but said, "We don't think that the Iraqi government, or a Iraqi government, will take that step any time in the near future."

US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who spent a day in Iraq last month, was briefed by Sunni and other groups on the security situation, including "the interest in an eventual transfer" to local security forces, Jeffrey said.

"But this was underlined very, very strongly -- nowhere more strongly than by Sunni Arabs -- they (US forces) should not be withdrawn until there are capable Iraqi troops that can move in and take care of the security situation."

Jeffrey said if some Iraqis such as the faction led by Shiite firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr sought a timetable for the US withdrawal, "there are many other groups that reject that."
