Family members of World Trade Center victims and residents of Lower Manhattan expressed opposition on Thursday to New York City's latest plan to search for human remains at the site.

The city outlined its plans to expand the search to encompass buildings, rooftops, and other streets that have not been searched before, including the Millennium Hotel.

"I certainly disapprove of this latest aspect of the plan," said Sally Regenhard who lost her son on Sept. 11 terror attacks, arguing that they still need a comprehensive assessment of the entire site, and overall plan, instead of making up plans as construction goes along.

In a letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg Wednesday, Deputy Mayor Ed Skyler outlined a year-long planned search of buildings, rooftops and streets for human remains.

City officials say any debris removed from the sites will be taken to a location in Brooklyn for further analysis. The Department of Environmental Protection also plans to test all the debris for toxins before it is transported there.

But at a community board meeting Wednesday night, some Lower Manhattan residents and victims' family members renewed their call for the military to supervise the search. Many want the city to bring in JPAC, the joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, a U.S. Army elite unit that specializes in searching for remains.

But the city insists it will do the job itself with assistance from the city's police department and fire department.

More than 200 remains have been found since crew from Con Edison, the city's major power supplier, stumbled upon some remains while doing routine work in a manhole last month. That discovery led to an expanded search.

The remains of over 40 percent of the victims from the World Trade Center attack have never been identified.
