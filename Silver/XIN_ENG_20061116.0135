A father from Shenzhen has donated all of his dying son's organs in an attempt to make his son's life more meaningful and memorable.

When 17-year-old Xia Chao Ming was diagnosed with an incurable galloping tumor in his head, his 48-year-old father Xia Yueyan decided to donate his son's organs. Initially, the shocked family could not agree but Xia's perseverance and persuasion finally made them change their minds.

"His eyes will still be shining and we will feel his heart beating if his organs remain alive somewhere in this world after his death", Xia Yueyan said.

Xia added that his son's life would be more meaningful and "prolonged" as more people would remember him.

The Xia family left their farmland in Yuanjiang of China's central Hunan province and opened a small restaurant in Shenzhen just a year ago. Xia Yueyan decided to donate his son's organs to the Shenzhen branch of the Red Cross Society and entered his son's name on the donation agreement after a long conversation with him.

Xia Chaoming agreed to his father's decision and said it was the right thing to do as he could not do enough to pay back his parents and society.

Many people sent money to Xia's family after media exposure and were declined. "Money is irrelevant. We are donating the organs not selling them", Xia said.

China is suffering a serious shortage of human organ donations as many Chinese believe that their body are their parents' flesh and blood and few are willing to donate their organs after death.

According to a recent report, about 1.5 million patients in China need organ transplants each year, but only around 10,000 operations can be carried out due to organ shortages.
