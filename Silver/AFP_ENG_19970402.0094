A breakaway rebel faction inflicted heavy casualties on the Sudan People's Liberation Army which attacked its Wun Roj stronghold in south Sudan's Bahrel Ghazal state last week, it was reported Wednesday.

Faustino Obanj, spokesman of the SPLA rebel Bahrel Ghazal group, said its forces had "repulsed the attackers, inflicting heavy casualties, in the form of soldiers and weapons," the independent Alwan daily newspaper reported.

Wun Roj, about 112 kilometers (70 miles) north of Qoqriyal is held by the rebel faction headed by Kerbino Kuanyen.

Obanj said the SPLA unit's commanding officer Silva Metok and his second in command James Lual were both injured. He said his men also captured 100 SPLA soldiers as well as 315 automatic rifles and 17 mortars.

"Most important of all, our forces seized Ajak airport, outside Wun Roj, which was built by foreign organizations and which is equipped with modern communications devices and lighting systems," Obanj said.

The Kerbino faction broke away from the SPLA in April last year, switched allegiances and signed an agreement with the government in Khartoum. It now fights the SPLA for the government in Bahrel Ghazal state.

He said the rebels were willing to fight for the government against "agents and mercenaries" seeking to destroy Sudanese unity, Obanj said.
