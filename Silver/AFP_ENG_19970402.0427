Albania and Italy agreed Wednesday on the need for the speedy deployment of an Italian-led force here, patching up their differences over a boat disaster in which dozens of Albanian refugees drowned.

Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi flew into southern Albania for talks with his Albanian counterpart Bashkim Fino.

Fino said Albania wanted the proposed 5,000-strong Italian-led international force to be sent immediately.

"Albania is ready (for the force), the other countries are ready, we must not waste any more time. Each day lost damages Albania," he told reporters, after the meeting.

Franz Vranitzky, the former Austrian chancellor heading the OSCE mission to Albania, told journalists that "the United Nations have given us three months," adding that the soldiers should be on the ground "in the space of 10 or 14 days."

The force's mission, approved by the UN Security Council March 28, involves securing roads, junctions, warehouses and aid depots, as well as in distributing the aid.

Albania's deputy defence minister, Alfred Moisiu, told AFP Tirana itself would set up a volunteer force of 3,000 "well armed" and "well paid" soldiers to support the international force.

Prodi said he had asked Fino to confirm that "the Albanian government still wanted the international operation to start as soon as possible. The prime minister assured me that that was what the government wanted," he said.

After their meeting, Fino went on to Athens for talks with Greek and other European officials.

The meeting seemed to clear the air clouded by the disaster Friday in which more than 80 Albanian refugees were believed killed in the sinking of an Albanian boat which collided with an Italian navy vessel.

Albanian anger at the drownings had raised doubts about whether Italian troops will be sent to southern Albania and military sources in Rome said Tuesday they believed Italian troops would not go to the south of the country.

That seemed less certain however Wednesday as pressure mounted to get the mission on the ground quickly.

"It has to be done quickly," said Vranitzky, head of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe humanitarian mission to Albania, after talks in Rome with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.

Vranitzky also told journalists "we have a chance to avoid" the errors committed in the former Yugoslavia, where there was an initial lack of international coordination.

"Albania has need of aid, of restoring public order, of economic reconstruction and in restoring confidence in its political system," Vranitzky said.

Dini said the force's deployment, which "not yet been decided, will be decided in common."

The comments came before a meeting in Rome of the countries which will supply the force's troops, whose mission is to protect humanitarian aid channels in the chaos-worn country.

In Brussels, EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino added to the calls with a warning that food supplies in Albania had reached alarming levels.

"There is no famine yet but we are concerned that stocks have been reduced below safety levels," she told the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee.

Bonino said EU food and medical aid could be sent to Albania quickly using logistical structures established in the former Yugoslavia. "But only if we can solve the protection problem."

The proposed international force's role would be strictly confined to protecting the humanitarian convoys, Bonino noted. "There is no mandate for disarming rebels or anything else of that nature," she said.

Italy is expected to provide some 2,000 soldiers; France said Tuesday it was sending 1,000; Greece has promised up to 700 troops; Turkey, 500; Romania, 400. Hungary ruled out sending troops while Spain and Portugal are still considering their contribution.
