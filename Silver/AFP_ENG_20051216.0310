A bomb exploded Friday near the building where Afghanistan's parliament will meet next week for the first time in three decades, killing an apparent suicide attacker and wounding two passers-by.

The bomb was in a car and exploded about 500 metres (1,650 feet) from the building where parliament is scheduled to open on Monday, killing the driver who appeared to be a suicide bomber, a government official said.

The bloodied and shredded remains of the dead man were flung about 50 metres off the road, which was strewn with metal and glass shards of the destroyed vehicle.

"It's believed to have been a suicide attack that was not able to make it to a potential target -- we believe it exploded prematurely," interior ministry spokesman Yousuf Stanizai told AFP.

"The bomb was placed in a pressure cooker. The driver has been killed and two passers-by were wounded," he said, blaming the attack on the "enemies of Afghanistan" -- a term used to refer to insurgents, including from the Taliban government ousted in 2001 in a US-led invasion.

A Norwegian vehicle in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force that patrols the heavily fortified capital was slightly damaged in the blast, ISAF said.

It was unclear if the ISAF convoy was the target of the blast, a spokesman said. ISAF patrols in the city were hit by two suicide blasts on November 14 which killed a German soldier and eight Afghans. Police blamed Taliban insurgents and their Al-Qaeda allies.

A purported spokesman for the toppled Taliban said one of the movement's fighters had carried out Friday's attack, which he claimed had been intended for the parliament building.

"The attack was carried out by one of our mujahedin (holy warriors)," Mohammed Hanif said by telephone.

"The actual target was the parliament building but when he saw lots of security outside, he changed his target to the NATO convoy," he said.

Another man who often contacts the media claiming to be a Taliban spokesman warned earlier that the parliament, elected in September in the first general legislative election since 1969, would become a target of the insurgency.

"The parliament has been made up by invader Americans. They want to impose it on Afghans," said Qari Mohammad Yousuf Ahmadi.

"We'll attack them as we attack the government and invading American infidels," he said by telephone.

The United States launched the attack that removed the Taliban from power after the hardliners refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.

Taliban rebels are mostly active in southern and eastern Afghanistan with the insurgency leaving more than 1,500 people dead this year. There has been an upsurge in Taliban-blamed suicide attacks in the past weeks, with about 10 since late September.

The violence has cast a shadow on the war-scarred country's attempts to moves towards democracy, a key step being the election for the parliament to meet on Monday.

Presidential spokesman Karim Rahimi said there may be some "disturbances" related to the sitting of the new parliament but this would not affect the quest for democracy.

"We believe that the process that the majority of the people of Afghanistan have chosen -- going towards democracy, having a parliament -- that will continue, despite some problems. This will not stop progress," he said.
