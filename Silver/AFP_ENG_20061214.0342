European Union enlargement has had a positive effect on the German economy so far, boosting gross domestic product by around one percentage point, and the benefits are likely to continue as the bloc expands further, a study showed on Thursday.

A study commissioned by the German Economy Mininstry showed that Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, had already largely profited from the extension of the EU from 15 to 25 nations in May 2004.

"And the study shows that the upcoming membership of Bulgaria and Romania will also have a slightly positive effect on overall economic developments in Germany," the ministry said in a statement.

"The positive effect of the fifth round of enlargement, which will be completed with the entry of Bulgaria and Romania, represents around one percent of German GDP in the long term," the statement said.

The two central European states are set to become the EU's 26th and 27th members on January 1.

"From a long-term perspective, Germany's potential in terms of foreign trade is not yet exhausted," the ministry said.

Economic immigration of citizens from most of new EU states had increased since May 2004 but "has fallen short of forecasts," largely as a result of interim regulations limiting such influxes, it said.
