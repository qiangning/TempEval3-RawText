Indian border guards shot dead two Moslem militants here Monday after a failed grenade attack on a police officer, officials said.

Three other militants were arrested after the shootout with the Border Security Force (BSF).

The initial attack occured in a busy street in a residential area near Islamia College, a BSF spokesman said.

A group of militants threw a grenade and opened fire at the car of deputy superintendent of police Mohammed Shafi Pattro. He escaped unhurt.

Dozens of BSF personnel, who are deployed on Srinagar's streets, rushed to the site and cordoned off several houses from where the militants were firing.

"A prolonged gunbattle followed," an officer said. "We shot dead two militants. Our men later recovered four AK-47 rifles and a universal machine gun.

"We are still looking for other militants."

Moslem militants are fighting for Kashmnir's independence from India. Around 20,000 people have died in the campaign since 1989.
