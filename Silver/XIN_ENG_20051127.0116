Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his Lao counterpart Bounnhang Vorachit Sunday jointly laid a founding stone to start construction of a controversial Nam Thuen II hydropower project, according to local media The Nation.

The ceremony took place at the construction site of the powerhouse at Gnoumalat district of Laos's central Khammouane Province. Some 300 officials from both countries and international financiers and investors attended the event.

During his weekly radio address on Saturday, Thaksin said that Thailand would buy electricity totaling 924 megawatts generated from this dam project annually upon its completion.

He said that Thailand needs to depend more on hydropower and coal and less on natural gas in generating electricity, he said.

Natural gas will be used in domestic transportation system, and, if possible, the country will stop using oil in power generation in the future.

The Nam Theun II hydropower project site is located in Khammouane and Bolikhamxay provinces in central Laos, about 250 kilometers southeast of the country's capital -- Vientiane.
