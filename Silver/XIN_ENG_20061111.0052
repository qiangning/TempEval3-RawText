Iraqi police patrols found seven unidentified bodies scattered in different parts of Baghdad on Saturday, an Interior Ministry source said.

"We have found seven unidentified bodies by our patrols in different Baghdad neighborhoods," the source told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.

Most of the bullet-riddled bodies were bound, blindfolded and showing signs of torture, the source said.

The almost daily gruesome body findings, assassinations and explosions in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities were seen as a major setback for the Iraqi government's efforts to stem violence and achieve national reconciliation.

UN and Iraqi officials estimate that more than 100 Iraqis are killed everyday in insurgent attacks and fighting between Sunni and Shiite factions.
