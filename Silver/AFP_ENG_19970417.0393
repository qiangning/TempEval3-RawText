President Boris Yeltsin said Thursday that Russia and NATO will sign an agreement defining their future relations at a summit meeting in Paris on May 27.

Speaking at a joint news conference with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with whom he had several hours' talks in this western German spa town, Yeltsin said: "We will now have to hurry up."

Kohl for his part said that "there still remains a lot to do, but I see a good chance of success."
