A dilapidated building in Dublin where leaders of a doomed Irish nationalist rebellion surrendered to their British rulers is to become a national monument, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said on Sunday.

The Taoiseach said number 16 Moore Street was of significant national importance as the "last stand" of the ill-fated "1916 Rising" against the British.

The house -- which sits on the site of Ireland's most famous street market -- had been due to be part of a multi-million euro refurbishment but a campaign to preserve it has been receiving increasing support.

Ahern said that from a historical, social and political standpoint, the house was of significant national importance as the "last stand" and should be given the country's highest conservation tag.

The building was dubbed the "Alamo" after the US fort which played a key role in the Texan war of independence against Mexico when Texan insurgents made their last stand and few survived.

In the 1916 Rising, Irish rebels took over the nearby General Post Office (GPO) building in O'Connell Street -- Dublin's main thoroughfare.

They retreated to the nearby Moore Street building when the British shelled the GPO and set it on fire.

Leaders including Padraig Pearse, Joseph Mary Plunkett, Sean MacDermott and Thomas Clarke, met in the building around the bed of the wounded James Connolly and decided to surrender to save further bloodshed.

Within weeks, all were executed by firing squad.

Ahern made the announcement while attending the annual commemoration in Castletown in southeast Ireland of another executed patriot, Liam Mellows, who died in the 1922 civil war that eventually led to Irish independence.

A museum commemorating the Rising was also being considered for the GPO, he added.

He said he wanted to see a "spirit of generosity" permeate modern Ireland's study of its history.

"This is our national inheritance. It is incumbent on all who value our democracy to join in suitably recognising the bravery, dignity and sacrifice of our forebearers," Ahern said.
