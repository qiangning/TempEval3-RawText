A cow being slaughtered in front of a butcher shop in Tehran broke free and went on a rampage, damaging shops and injuring several people, before being shot dead by police, a newspaper reported Tuesday.

The butcher had only made a small cut in the throat of the enormous cow, which was lying on the ground with its four legs tied up, before it managed to free itself, the daily Iran said

The hysterical animal first attacked the butcher and then several shops and passers-by in the poor southern district of Yaftabad, the paper added.

Panic-stricken residents sought help from the police, who after obtaining permission from a judge, shot the cow dead in a fruit and vegetable store.

Several people suffered injuries and shops were damaged, the paper said.

Although livestock are increasingly butchered in slaughterhouses in big cities, some people still prefer to do it themselves.
