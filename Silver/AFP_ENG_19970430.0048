At least 47 people have been killed and 14 more injured while taking short cuts across a railway line in southern China's Guangdong province in the past four months, it was reported Wednesday.

Most of the victims struck down by trains were villagers and migrant workers along the 147-kilometer (91-mile) railway line which links Guangzhou with Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, the Chinese-language Apple Daily said.

Despite security fences and footbridges being set up across the rail line, local people continued to take short cuts across the lines, with railway officials finding more than 300 places where fences were cut down, the report said.

The number of accidents has risen sharply in recent months, the paper said.

High-speed trains running at speeds of up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour began running along the route two years ago.
