The 11th inter-mission force commanders' conference of the United Nations Missions in West Africa continued here on Thursday evening with the objective of exchanging and updating information to enhance their military operations aimed at maintaining peace and stability within the region.

The conference brought together UN military force commanders from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire and the military consular of the UN West Africa's office in Dakar, Senegal.

UN Force Commander in Liberia Lt/Gen. Chikardibia Obiakor said the conference was progressing successfully and that by the end of November, various military missions would collaborate in joint border patrols code named "Operation Siskin."

Obiakor disclosed that local security forces including those in Guinea would also participate in the operation.

For Liberians, he said "this would serve as a means of establishing a framework for them to take over security responsibilities when the UN mission leaves the country."

Liberia and Sierra Leone are in their post-conflict period following more than ten years of war while Cote d'Ivoire is yet to restore peace.

The coordination of military exercises involving various UN missions and their local counterparts is seen as a confidence- building measure.

The UN force commander in Sierra Leone Col. Seven-Olof Broman also said condition in the country were calm and his mission was pre-occupied with post-conflict peace-building activities.

"There can not be security without development and there can not be development without security," Broman said.
