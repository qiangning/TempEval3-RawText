The German parliament Friday voted to extend the mandate of about 300 troops serving in the U.S.-led anti-terror "Operation Enduring Freedom."

The Bundestag, parliament's lower chamber, achieved the one- year extension after 436 deputies voted for, 101 against and 26 abstained. As many as 300 German naval troops are stationed in the Horn of Africa under the mandate.

Last month, the parliament extended the deployment of around 2, 800 German soldiers in Afghanistan serving in the 31,000 NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).

ON the same day, the German Defense Ministry confirmed that members of Germany's elite Kommando Spezialkraefte (KFK) are operating in Afghanistan under ISAF command.
