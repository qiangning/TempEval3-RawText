The United Nations envoy for Somalia on Tuesday called on the international community to respond generously to the needs of Somali communities affected by rising flood waters.

In a statement issued in Nairobi, UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Somalia Francois Lonseny Fall said during his visit to Baidoa on Monday, Somali leaders expressed concerns that too little relief was being offered to people in dire need.

"It was also clear to me that the extent of flooding is beyond anything seen in Somalia in many years," Fall said in the statement issued after his visit to the flood-hit Horn of African nation.

In the past six weeks, most parts of the country have already received more than 300 percent of their normal rainfall. UN agencies and non-governmental organizations are delivering food relief, shelter materials and other emergency support, but more will be needed.

The UN estimates that about 1.1 million in southern Somalia are already facing a humanitarian emergency and the rainy season will still last several weeks.

Fall flew to Baidoa on Monday to emphasize the need for Somalia 's Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) to remain united.

He sought assurances from President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed and Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi that they were committed to the unity of the TFIs and a resumption of dialogues with the Islamic Courts following the postponement of the third round of the Khartoum peace talks early this month.

The UN envoy was accompanied to Baidoa by several representatives from the International Advisory Contact Group for Somalia, which was set up earlier this year to assist the peace process.
