The dollar moved in a narrow range against the yen in mid-afternoon trading here Wednesday, as activity slowed ahead of a long weekend in Japan.

At 2 p.m. (0500 GMT), the dollar was quoted at 126.97 yen, slightly up from 126.84 yen earlier in the day and 126.88 yen in New York Tuesday afternoon.

The dollar also traded at 1.7238, down from 1.7245 earlier and 1.7259 in New York Tuesday.

The US unit was lower against the mark on stop-loss dollar selling activated at the 1.7220-25 mark level, but with the declines likely to be recouped in European trading, dealers said.

The dollar's falls against the mark was also due to buying of the German unit against the yen as investors covered positions following the mark's recent falls against the yen, dealers said.

Activity was focused on the mark-yen cross with investors reluctant to take fresh positions in dollar-yen trading ahead of the long weekend through Monday in Japan, they said.

"Investors were encouraged to accelerate buying of the mark against the yen after the mark broke through technical upside resistance at the 73.60 yen level," said Tokai Bank dealer Masahiro Yamaguchi.

The mark traded at 73.66 yen mid-afternnon here.

"I think the mark will continue rising close to the 74 yen level and the dollar, in turn, is expected to continue falling against the mark," Yamaguchi said.
