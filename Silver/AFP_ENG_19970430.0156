Six people were struck dead by bolts of lightning across India following heavy rains, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Wednesday.

Two shepherds and a farmer who had taken shelter under a tree during a storm Tuesday night were hit by lightning and died instantly in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

Several sheep near the tree were also charred to death.

Three women were killed after lightning struck late Tuesday in the western state of Maharashtra, PTI said. It was followed by heavy rains which inundated several low-lying areas and damaged crops.
