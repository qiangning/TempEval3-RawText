An executive with a multinational company arrested in Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir was a key conspirator in the Oct. 29 bombings in the Indian capital that were carried out by four terrorists, the Delhi Police chief said Sunday.

Tariq Ahmed Dar, who was arrested in Srinagar, capital of Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, was described by Delhi Police Commissioner K.K. Paul as "one of the key conspirators" behind the blasts that killed over 60 people and injured more than 200.

Paul said his force had also identified the four terrorists who carried out the bombings in the busy Paharganj and Sarojini Nagar markets and in a bus. "Two of the bombers could be foreigners," Indo-Asian News Service quoted Paul as saying.

Delhi Police confirmed the use of RDX in the blasts and said they had found crucial clues from the blast sites that pointed to the involvement of the outlawed Lashker-e-Taiba.

Dar was not in Delhi on the day of the blasts but had visited the capital in the first week of October to select the targets for the attacks.

Paul also claimed Dar had functioned as a spokesman for the Lashker, saying that soon after the blasts, Dar had contacted a news agency in Srinagar and denied the Lashker's involvement in the bombings.

Dar reportedly joined the Hizbul Mujahideen, the most powerful Kashmiri guerrilla group, in 2003 but later teamed up with the Lashker.

He was helped by two other terrorists to hatch the conspiracy behind the Oct.29 bombings, police said.

Paul said Dar worked as a sales representative for Johnson and Johnson in Srinagar. Dar had obtained a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1995 and also wrote for the "Mount Valley Magazine" in Srinagar.

Officials said Dar's role in the attacks came to light after a special team of Delhi Police was sent to Kashmir Nov.1 and was asked to probe links between guerrilla groups in that state and the bombings, the worst terror attack in the Indian capital.

"We suspected that the terrorists were from Kashmir and we were hopeful of making a breakthrough," said Paul, noting that around 500,000 rupees was transferred to Dar's bank account just before the blasts.

Police officials said Dar was taken to the blast sites to identify the targets and to confirm his involvement.

According to them, Dar was arrested by the Indian Army on Nov. 10 and handed over to Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir Police for questioning. Police said Dar was brought to Delhi on Nov. 11 and was interrogated by senior officials of the Special Cell and intelligence agencies.

Police said Dar was arrested after the army intercepted his telephone conversations.
