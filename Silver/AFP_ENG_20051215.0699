Campaigning ended in Bolivia on Thursday, ahead of a weekend election pitting a former president against a leftist indigenous leader who wants to end eradication of the plant that produces cocaine.

Opinion polls ahead of Sunday's election, closely watched by Washington, gave a few points advantage to Evo Morales, 46, whose campaign has been marked by anti-US slogans, pledges to increase state controls over the key gas industry and a promise to defend coca plantations.

If he manages to defeat former president Jorge Quiroga, 45, he would become the first indigenous president of the impoverished South American country.

But he appears unlikely to win the 50 percent of the ballots needed for an outright victory, in which case the decision will be in the hands of the new Congress that will also be elected on Sunday.

"One vote, two votes are important," Morales told his supporters in Cochabamba. "A little more effort, more participation to free Bolivia as soon as possible," he urged.

Eight candidates are in the running, but the scene appears to be set for a battle between Morales and Quiroga, a US-educated technocrat who was president for a year after Hugo Banzer, then stricken by cancer, stepped down in 2001.

Opinion polls put support for Morales at 35 percent, with Quiroga getting 28 to 29 percent and the other candidates trailing far behind.

Quiroga has gone so far as to call Morales a "narco" trafficker.

US officials are keeping a keen eye on the election in a region that has seen several left-leaning leaders rise to power in recent years.

And Washington has made no bones about its concern over Morales' pledge to end US-funded programs to eradicate coca, from which traffickers extract cocaine for US drug users.

However, Indians have chewed coca leaf, a mild stimulant in its natural form, for thousands of years. It is used in indigenous rituals and as medication against altitude sickness in the Andean country.

"We expect whatever government comes next in Bolivia to honor those commitments that they have made to fight the production and transport of illegal drugs," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Thursday.

The outcome of the presidential election would only be decided on January 22, if no candidate garners 50 percent of the votes on Sunday.

The 157-seat Congress would then elect the new president, and is not bound to pick the front-runner.

With electoral campaigning officially ending on Thursday, the candidates made a last-ditch effort to win the votes of as many as 21 percent of still undecided voters.

Morales has capitalized on his popularity as the leader of a growing movement to wrest Bolivia's natural gas reserves from foreign control. He played a key role in protests that forced two presidents out of office in the past three years.

Quiroga, for his part, promised jobs, universal health care, better prices for Bolivia's natural gas and the writing off of the country's huge foreign debt.

Quiroga supporters claim a Morales presidency would scare off private investors and lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.

But the Morales camp claims that the pro free-market Quiroga would auction off the country and strengthen the power of oil multinationals.
