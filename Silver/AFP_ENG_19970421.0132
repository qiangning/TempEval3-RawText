The number of Asian cities with populations of more than 10 million, or "megacities," is projected to increase from nine to 20 by 2025 as the region continues to face the spectre of urban migration, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Monday.

The continent's urban population is forecast to double from the current 1.1 billion to 2.5 billion by 2025, by which time Asia will be home to half of the world's people, the Manila-based bank said in its annual report released here.

Such growth is expected to lead to more pollution, traffic jams, water shortages, increased crime and the proliferation of slum areas, ADB said, and urged proper management of megacities to avert an urban catastrophe.

Megacities would need up to 40 billion dollars annually over the next decade "to provide services at levels sufficient to sustain productivity, and achieve improvements in the quality of life."

A large proportion of these funds would go to improvements in transport and communication, energy, and water supply and sanitation, the bank said.

To raise this amount, "traditional ways of financing capital costs and recovering current costs will have to be supplemented" by funding from the private sector, increased property tax collection and access by local government to the capital markets.

"Although funding may not be sufficient at present, it is crucial for megacities to anticipate the needs of infrastructure and service provision now," it said.

Beijing, Bombay, Calcutta, Jakarta, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Tianjin and Tokyo have been classified by the bank as megacities.

Eleven more are candidates for megacity status in the next 28 years -- Bangalore, Bangkok, Dhaka, Hyderabad, Karachi, Lahore, Madras, Manila, New Delhi, Shenyang and Rangoon, the bank said.

"Of the total projected 20 megacities, half will have populations of 20 million or more and 10 will be in South Asia," the bank said.

"While megacities can be expected to dominate the economic transformation of Asia, the quality of life for their residents will be very much related to the quality of their management," ADB added, endorsing moves to privatize services such as water and sewerage systems.
