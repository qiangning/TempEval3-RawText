All the 32 teams for next year's World Cup finals in Germany have been known after the qualifying campaign finally came to the end on Wednesday.

Australia, Spain, Trinidad & Tobago, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic completed the 32-team lineup for the World Cup finals.

Australia reached the World Cup for the first time in 32 years by beating Uruguay 4-2 from the spot after a 1-0 extra time win saw the playoff end 1-1 on aggregate.

It was also a historic day for the Czechs, who beat Norway 1-0 in Prague for a 2-0 aggregate to qualify for their first ever World Cup finals.

Trinidad & Tobago will also make their debut in the premier soccer tournament after pulling off a spectacular comeback in the qualifying campaign with a 1-0 win over Bahrain in Manama for a 2-1 aggregate victory.

Switzerland, who had won 2-0 in the first leg in Bern, lost 4-2 in Istanbul to Turkey to level the tie at 4-all on aggregate, but still qualified for the World Cup on away goals, ending a 12-year absence from the finals.

Spain reached their eighth successive World Cup since 1978 with a 1-1 draw in Slovakia for a 6-2 aggregate win.

The 2006 World Cup will kick off on June 9 in Munich and ends on July 9 in Berlin. The draw takes place in Leipzig on December 9.
