Nation cuddles Olympic mascots

By Zhou Yan

BEIJING, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- A panda cub waited for 10 weeks to get a name. Newborn babies are named after them. Anxious buyers thronged department stores for cuddly stuffed toys.

Bei Bei, Jing Jing, Huan Huan, Ying Ying and Ni Ni won the hearts of the entire Chinese nation at the very instant they were unveiled as mascots of the 2008 summer Olympiad to be held in Beijing.

The giant panda breeding research base in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province, named a 10-week old female panda cub "Jing Jing" on Saturday -- exactly the same name as the mascot giant panda.

The cub was born on Aug. 30 but was never named, said zoologists with the Chengdu base. "We hope she'll grow up healthily and witness the Beijing Olympiad. The mascot will bring her good luck."

Panda researchers at the base said they have archived Jing Jing's pictures and all important data at www.panda.org.cn. "Everyone can send her greetings online," they said.

Jing Jing was born 152 grams and now weighs 4,266 grams. Her mother, 15, was named "Ya Ya (Asia)" because she was born in 1990, the year Beijing hosted the 11th Asian Games. Jing Jing's father, the handsomest "panda prince" at the Chengdu base, was named "Ke Bi" by former International Olympic Committee President Samaranch.

A baby boy born at 8:00 p.m. Friday in Beijing has been named Bei Bei, the name of the Carp, the first of the five mascots.

"My wife and I were watching the televised gala and guessing which candidate would stand out when the doctors said she should have a Caesarean section," said Mr. Hu, the new father. "She was sent back to the ward with the baby at the very moment the five mascots were announced."

Hu and his wife then agreed they would name the baby after one of the mascots.

The Olympic mascots Beijing announced on Friday were cartoon renditions of a panda, a carp, a Tibetan antelope, a swallow and the Olympic flame, each one the color of one of the Olympic rings.

Starting on Saturday, stuffed toys and commemorative coins of the five mascots have opened a marketing blitz.

Saturday morning found anxious crowds waiting outside major department stores in Beijing before the business hours.

"It's a great idea to have five mascots because the Chinese believe in 'wufu' (five happiness)," said a senior citizen surnamed Yu. Yu left his home in the northwestern suburbs of Beijing at 5:00 a.m. to buy a full set of the mascots at one of the city's oldest department stores in the downtown Wangfujing commercial street.

Nanjing, a boom city in east China's Jiangsu Province, has ordered air shipments of the stuffed toys from Beijing to meet the demands of anxious buyers.

"On Saturday and Sunday alone, we sold 400,000 yuan (nearly 50,000 US dollars) of the toy mascots," said Li Qiaosheng, general manager of Xinbai Department Store, one of the biggest in Nanjing.

Yet some citizens' love for the Olympic mascots went irrational. The Beijing Metro decorated all subway trains with dainty pictures of the Olympic mascots on the handrails but by Sunday afternoon, nearly a half of the pictures had gone.

Most of the pictures stolen represented Jing Jing the Panda and Huan Huan the Olympic Flame, said a Beijing Metro employee.

"Of course everyone loves the pretty mascots," said a subway rider who gave only his surname as Zhang. "But it's a shame to steal the pictures. The Olympic Games is an occasion to present China to the world -- we should present our good images."
