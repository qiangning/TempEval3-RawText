Israel's state prosecutor Edna Arbel said Friday she has already decided on whether to press corruption charges against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over a botched appointment of attorney general.

Arbel told public radio that her decision, due to be announced on Sunday night, had been "very difficult to take." The grounds for the decision will be drafted and passed on to new attorney general Eliakim Rubinstein for approval.

"The prosecutor's office has enough proof to reach a conclusion and we do not need any more investigation," the 53-year-old state prosecutor said in a separate radio interview.

"The differences between the first version of the affair as presented on Israeli television and the conclusions of the police inquiry will be clear. The media pressure made the inquiry more difficult," she said.

The conclusions "will speak for themselves," said Arbel, while Rubinstein said he agreed.

She said earlier the same day that there were "different opinions, but no real divergences" in her office on police recommendations that Netanyahu be indicted for fraud and breach of trust.

Police announced Wednesday they had recommended the charges against Netanyahu over the short-lived appointment in January of Likud activist Roni Bar-On as attorney general.

Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said investigators also recommended legal action against Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, Netanyahu's chief of staff Avigdor Lieberman and the head of the Shas party, Arieh Deri.

Police suspect Deri of "attempted blackmail" by conditioning his support in a key government vote over the peace process with the Palestinians on Bar-0n's appointment.

In exchange for his support, Bar-On was slated to lift fraud and bribery charges facing the Shas leader. Rubinstein was named in Bar- On's place in February.
