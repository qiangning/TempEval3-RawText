Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono Monday announced a cabinet reshuffle, dismissing three ministers, shifting three others including his top economy minister and bringing in three new faces.

Former finance minister Budiono was installed as coordinating minister for the economy, replacing Aburizal Bakrie, who has shifted to be coordinating minister for people's welfare, Yudhoyono said in Yogyakarta, Central Java.

The president had last week announced the inclusion of Budiono, who served as finance minister under former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, in his new cabinet -- a move welcomed by financial markets.

Yudhoyono said Friday he had asked Budiono, 62, to help him "rearrange" his economic team, whose performance has been heavily criticised by analysts since his government came to power in October 2004.

Indonesia's economy has taken a beating this year, with soaring global fuel prices putting a major dent in public coffers and pushing down the rupiah as the government scrambled to keep paying out expensive domestic fuel subsidies.

In other changes, national development planning minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati replaced finance minister Yusuf Anwar, while Indrawati's place was taken by Paskah Suzetta.

Suzetta is a Golkar party MP who heads the parliamentary commission dealing with finance, development planning, banking and non-banking financial institutions.

Industry minister Andung Nitimihardja was replaced by manpower minister Fahmi Idris, while Idris was replaced by Erman Suparno, another MP who is currently deputy chair of the parliamentary commission dealing with transportation, telecommunications, civil work and housing.
