BEIJING, Nov. 14(Xinhua)-- Passengers via the shipping line from Xiamen, a coastal city of Fujian Province that sees Taiwan across the sea, to Jinmen, will top 500,000 in 2005.

According to statistics of the Port of Xiamen, in the first ten months of 2005, passengers via this line reached 438,113 person-times, up 32.4 percent year-on-year.

On Jan. 2, 2001, the passenger shipping line between Xiamen and Jinmen opened to direct passenger traffic between the two sides of Taiwan strait.

During these years, this line has become a golden traffic line, which facilitates people going across the strait, according to Zhou Qinghai, chief of the Administration Department of the Xiamen Municipal Port Authorities.

Statistics show that passenger throughput grew from 20,835 in 2001 to 406,883 person-times in 2004, a jump of almost twenty times.

Zhou said this line became more popular when the annual cross-Strait mechanical and electronic products trade fair held in April and when Lien Chan, then chairman of Taiwan's Kuomintang party and James Soong, chairman of the People First Party visited the mainland in the first half of this year.

July witnessed a record-breaking passenger throughput of 50,813 person-times for a single month.

At present there are 12 voyages a day on the line, and the Port of Xiamen has an annual capacity of transporting one million people.

Ever since April 1997, experimental direct sailing between the two sides of the Taiwan strait has made Port of Xiamen one of most important ports to undertake mainland-Taiwan shipping.
