Incessant rain and thundershowers wiped out the morning session of the second day's play in the first cricket Test between India and Sri Lanka on Saturday.

With the Chepauk outfield waterlogged and little chance of the sun breaking through to dry the ground, there was unlikely to be any play on the second day after the first day was washed out.

Umpires Daryl Harper and Mark Benson may call off play during the scheduled lunch break at 11:30 am (0600 GMT) if the weather does not improve.

Cyclone Baaz, which was hovering in the Bay of Bengal, weakened into a depression late on Friday but brought rain through the night to leave this southern metropolis drenched.

Bad weather has already deprived Chennai of its last three international matches.

India's one-day internationals against New Zealand in 2003 and South Africa last fortnight were abandoned without a ball being bowled.

The second Test against Australia in October last year was drawn after the final day's play was washed out with India on the doorstep of victory.

Local cricket officials, fearing another rain-affected match, chose to sell only daily tickets for the Sri Lanka Test.

The three-Test series is Sri Lanka's first on Indian soil in eight years.
