Three bomb explosions rocked Thailand's southern border province Narathiwat Friday morning, injuring three soldiers and 11 civilians, the Thai news network The Nation reported.

A unit of soldiers was on their routine patrol duty in the province's Sungai Padi district when the first bomb exploded at about 7 a.m. (0000 GMT). Three soldiers were injured and they were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.

One hour later, two bomb blasts occurred at a coffee shop in the province's capital seat, injuring 11 civilians who were drinking coffee and chatting there. The injured were transported to Narathiwat Rachanakarin Hospital, the report said.

The insurgency-related unrest continued unabated in Narathiwat, Yala and Pattani, the three southernmost provinces of Thailand with a majority population of Thai-Malay ethnic group. Over 1,700 peoples have been killed in a new wave flared there since January 2004.
