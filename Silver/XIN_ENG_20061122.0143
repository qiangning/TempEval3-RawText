Gunmen have kidnapped seven foreign workers including one Italian from an Agip oil vessel off the Nigerian coast, industry and security officials said on Wednesday.

According to a statement released by Italian oil company Eni, parent company of Agip, seven of its workers were taken hostage when 10 armed men attacked the vessel where there were 83 crew members aboard.

The nationalities of the other hostages were not immediately known, the statement added, adding that "the remaining 76 members of the crew are in good health and no damage to the ship was reported."

The vessel was about 50 km off the coast of Nigeria's southern Rivers State when attacked, Nigerian security officials said.

The kidnappings were the latest in a series of attack on oil installations in the volatile Niger Delta, where most of the country's oil is produced.

Since the beginning of the year, militant groups have constantly attacked oil facilities and taken oil workers as hostages.

Nigeria, Africa's largest oil producer and the sixth largest oil exporter in the world, has a daily crude oil output of 2.6 million barrels.
