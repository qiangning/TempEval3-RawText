The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Wednesday launched emergency operations to help hundreds of thousands of people affected by severe floods in Somalia.

In a statement issued in Nairobi, the relief agency said it was stepping up its emergency operation to assist more than 300,00 people affected by floods in southern Somalia.

"The year 2006 has been catastrophic for the Somali people. After the worst drought in a decade, they are now facing torrential rain," said Pascal Hundt, head of the ICRC delegation in Somalia.

"Families are pushed to the limit of their capabilities, trying to survive under such extreme climate conditions. What they need most is drinking water, shelter and food," Hundt added.

The ICRC started airlifting tarpaulins to assist 324,000 people in Jubba, Gedo and Hiraan regions, where floods have swept farmlands, disrupted food supplies and cut off villages, claiming at least 52 lives and affecting nearly a million people.

The World Food Program (WFP) on Monday launched a three-month regional air operation with fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters to transport humanitarian workers and aid to regions in Somalia and Kenya that have been cut off by the floods.

"We are particularly concerned about the situation in Somalia. The floods compound what was already one of the most horrendous humanitarian situations in the world. The country has endured 15 years of armed conflict; it lacks basic health services and infrastructure," Hundt said.

The rain has also dislodged landmines seeded in Somalia's long- running strife, posing additional hazards.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimated that it would need well over 7 million U.S. dollars in Somalia alone to provide aid to a projected 1 million flood victims.

The floods which also affect Kenya and Ethiopia began in late October and intensified food insecurity brought about by the drought earlier this year.

In many areas, the soil was so dry that it could not even absorb rainwater. The few crops that survived the drought are now destroyed.
