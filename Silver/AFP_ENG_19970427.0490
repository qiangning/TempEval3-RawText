Plans to step up the European Union's ties to Hong Kong after this transfer to Chinese rule on July 1 will be discussed for the first time at a meeting of EU foreign ministers here on Tuesday.

On the table will be a report from the European Commission setting out how the EU should go about defending its extensive interests in the territory -- the bloc's 10th largest trading partner -- and its role in ensuring that Beijing honours its commitments to respect its autonomy.

At the heart of the commission's strategy, drawn up by British commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, is a commitment to continue dealing directly with Hong Kong after the Chinese takeover and to actively developing ties in those areas, such as trade, where it will have autonomy from Beijing.

Other areas earmarked for more "formal and structured" cooperation include investment, customs cooperation and the battle against fraud.

Confidence in Hong Kong's future depends on its new status as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China not leading to an erosion of the rule of law or key rights such as free speech, the right to assembly and form political parties and data protection, the commission report noted.

Primary responsibility for ensuing that the SAR lives up to its tasks lies with the Hong Kong government and Chinese authorities, but the EU also had a role to play in monitoring events.

"The EU should ensure permanent vigilance and keep a watching brief on developments in Hong Kong," the report states.

To ensure this happens, the commission is proposing to draw up an annual report on the economic, political and human rights situation in Hong Kong. The reports would not only ensure regular discussion in Hong Kong but would also provide the basis for discussions in the EU's political dialogue with Beijing.

The report also called for high-level visits to Hong Kong to be given priority after the handover. "Hong Kong depends on confidence and alertness in the international community is an important guarantee to sustain this confidence," Brittan said.

More controversially, the commission called on EU governments to guarantee that Hong Kong will be assessed on its own merits when a decision is made about whether its population will need visas to visit Europe.

"The benefits which easy travel gives to developing economic and other contacts, and the importance of demonstrating confidence in Hong Kong's future, suggest that freer access to the EU would be in the interests of both the EU and of Hong Kong."

Although Britain has the biggest connections with Hong Kong, it is not the only one with a vested interest in its future prosperity. France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy all have annual trade with the colony in excess of two billion dollars.

The construction of Hong Kong's new airport alone has involved some 115 European companies and there are some 250 European business which have regional headquarters there.

There are also an average of 50,000 EU citizens in Hong Kong at any one time, including 32,000 who are permanently settled there.
