Inflation in Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, remained steady at 2.3 percent in November, way above the European Central Bank's ceiling of 2.0 percent, final consumer price data showed on Wednesday.

The German consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.5 percent in November from the figure for October, but was 2.3 percent higher than it had been in November 2004, the federal statistics office, Destatis, said in a statement.

The final November CPI data confirmed a preliminary estimate published late last month.

Using the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), which is the ECB's yardstick for inflation, the annual rate of inflation in Germany also stood at 2.3 percent in November, the statisticians found.

The ECB defines price stability as consumer price increases of close to but just under 2.0 percent.
