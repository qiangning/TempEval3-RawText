A blast and fire at a vandalised oil pipeline Tuesday in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos killed at least 200 people and left dozens more badly burned, according to an AFP correspondent at the scene.

Scores of bodies lay in the foam and water that firefighters were using to bring the blaze in the city's northern Abule Egba district under control.
