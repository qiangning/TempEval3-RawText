Some 4.66 million registered voters in Azerbaijan Saturday went to the polls amid opposition protests.

The oppositions said the elections to choose the 125-seat Milli Majlis, or national assembly, have been marked by "harassment" as a leading opposition party's campaign leader has been kept under arrest for a third day.

Faramaz Javadov, campaign manager for the Democratic Party, was reportedly arrested in a raid on the party's election headquarters on Thursday evening.

Opposition parties of the country, including Javadov's Democratic Party, which are united in the the Azadlyq (Freedom) Bloc, have promised demonstrations if any fraud is detected.

Pledging a fair and transparent vote, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Javadov was arrested when police were searching his offices after a tip-off about illegal weapons.

"Faramaz Javadov put up resistance and he was therefore arrested for obstructing police." said the spokesman.

The government of President Ilham Aliyev has introduced a package of anti-fraud measures, including applying special ink on voters' fingers to prevent multiple voting in the elections which have drawn much attention from western countries.

Meanwhile, the voting process in the oil-rich nation of eight million people will also be watched by about 2,000 Azeri monitors, as well as 1,291 foreign observers.

The polls will be closed at 1500 GMT and preliminary results are expected to come out within 24 hours.
