A Lebanese multi-millionairess has anonymously purchased a yacht formerly owned by disgraced politician Bernard Tapie, a French newspaper reported Wednesday.

Mouna al Ayoub, ex-wife of a close friend of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, has bought the four-master "Phocea" for 36.5 million francs (6.3 million francs), according to the daily Le Figaro.

The administrators selling off the bankrupt former soccer boss's assets announced a few days ago that the 74-metre (250 foot) yacht was being sold to Tranquil Ltd, a company based in the British Virgin Islands.

Le Figaro said the company was a front for the Lebanese jet-setter, who it said had homes in Paris and Majorca, and lived for 18 years with her husband in a Riyadh palace.

Despite its price tag, the "Phocea" is in one sense a consolation prize compared to a 105-metre vessel, the "Lady Mouna," which she used to sail in, but which belongs to her ex-husband.

Tapie is currently serving an eight-month jail term over a football match-rigging scandal.

Ironically, on Tuesday he was allowed out of jail under day-release terms to work for a shipbuilding firm run by a former colleague -- which previously did maintenance work on his own former yacht.
