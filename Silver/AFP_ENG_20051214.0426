The new British proposal on the EU budget is "still untenable", a German government source said on Wednesday on the eve of a crucial EU summit in Brussels.

For agreement to be reached, there would have to be a "lasting solution to the British rebate issue", the source said.

However the German government noted that the atmosphere "had clearly improved" compared with the fractious summit in June when no agreement could be found on the issue.

While the 25 EU member states are still not on the same page on the budget, Germany is hoping the better mood will translate into an agreement, the source said.

"There is an urgent need for success," the source added.
