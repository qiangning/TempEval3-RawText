Using a combination of ground-based and orbiting telescopes, astronomers reported on Tuesday that they have discovered the possible birth of a tiny solar system around a failed star.

The failed star, called brown dwarf by astronomers, is less than one-hundredth the mass of the Sun. It is the smallest known star-like object to harbor what appears to be a planet-forming disk of rocky and gaseous debris.

The brown dwarf, Cha 110913-773444, is located 500 light years away in the constellation Chamaeleon. One day the debris around it could evolve into tiny planets and create a solar system in miniature, said a research team led by Kevin Luhman, an assistant professor at the Pennsylvania State University.

The finding will appear in the Dec. 10 issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters.

"The similarity in the disk fractions of stars and brown dwarfs is consistent with a common formation mechanism and indicates that the raw materials for planet formation are available around brown dwarfs as often as around stars," the researchers said in the paper.

The fact that a brown dwarf this small could be in the midst of creating a solar system challenges the very definition of star, planet, moon and solar system.

"Our goal is to determine the smallest 'sun' with evidence for planet formation," said Luhman.

"Here we have a sun that is so small it is the size of a planet. The question then becomes, what do we call any little bodies that might be born from this disk: planets or moons?"

If this protoplanetary disk does form into planets, the whole system would be a miniaturized version of our solar system -- with the central "sun," the planets, and their orbits all roughly 100 times smaller, he said in a statement.

The team detected the brown dwarf with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, and two telescopes in the Chilean Andes, the Blanco telescope of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and the Gemini South telescope.

"There are two camps when it comes to defining planets versus brown dwarfs," said team member Giovanni Fazio of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

"Some go by size, and others go by how the object formed. For instance, this new object would be called a planet based on its size, but a brown dwarf based on how it formed."
