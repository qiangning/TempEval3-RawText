United Front coalition leader Inder Kumar Gujral on Sunday said he would improve India's relations with Pakistan after forming his new government.

Gujral said the alliance government would follow an independent foreign policy and added he would also try and improve relations between India and its other neighbours.

The new United Front leader, who has served as India's foreign minister under three governments and who is expected to be named prime minister later Sunday, promised normal ties with arch-rival Pakistan.

"This area will be given considerable importance by the new government," he said.

Gujral said he has evolved a "five-point doctrine" to improve India's foreign relations in the region and said the subject would be a "priority area".

The former diplomat said India's ties with Europe, the United States, China and Russia "would get the equal attention of the United Front government."

As foreign minister in his predecessor H.D. Deve Gowda's government, Gujral helped end a three-year freeze on official talks between India and Pakistan last month.

He also eased travel restrictions for Pakistanis visiting India before holding talks with Pakistani foreign minister Gohar Ayub Khan in April.

That, ironically, was due to pave the way for a meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries at a regional summit next month in the Maldives. Now Gujral looks set to represent India there himself.

India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.
