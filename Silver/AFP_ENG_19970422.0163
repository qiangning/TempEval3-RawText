An Indonesian court in East Java Tuesday handed down six and four year jail sentences for two pro-democracy activists accused of subversion, their lawyer said.

The Surabaya, East Java, district court handed the sentences to Dita Indahsari and Coen Husein Pontoh from the small pro-democracy group People's Democratic Party (PRD), for inciting labor riots in the province.

"The two were very calm, even smiling, when the sentences were read out since they knew that they would be found guilty as this trial has been so politicized," one of their lawyers, Nurbadria (eds: one name), told AFP by phone from Surabaya.

Nurbadria said chief judge Amrin Boer found Dita, 24, and Coen, 27, guilty of inciting labor riots, and also of being members of the unrecognized PRD. Both are appealing their sentences, she added.

"I'm not surprised, this was a political trial and the judges were not free," said Trimulya Suryadi, another lawyer for the pair.

PRD is an umbrella group of labor, student and farmer activists.

Nurbadria said Tuesday's court session was attended by hundreds of people, and heavily secured by police who checked the identities of all the court attendees. No incidents were reported during the session.

Dita's sentence was longer because the court found her guilty of inciting more labor riots and strikes than Coen, Nurbadria said. The prosecutor had earlier asked for eight years for Dita and six for Coen.

Subversion carries a maximum penalty of death.

Dita and Coen were detained shortly after a mass labor strike nearby Surabaya in early July.

Police violently broke up the march of some 4,000 workers from 10 factories in the industrial area of Tandes, Surabaya, as two workers' groups were trying to join forces and walk to another factory.

The demonstrators were demanding a 75 percent raise in their daily wage from 4,000 rupiah to 7,000 rupiah (1.70 dollars to three dollars.)

The subversion trial of another 11 PRD members has been underway since December in two Jakarta courts, with prosecutors demanding sentences of between 12 and 15 years.

The 11 were were detained soon after mass riots in Jakarta on July 27. The riots were sparked by an attack on the headquarters of the Indonesian Democracy Party (PDI), until then under the control of toppled leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, by a rival faction backed by troops.

The popular Megawati was ousted as PDI chairwoman by a government- backed faction in June.
