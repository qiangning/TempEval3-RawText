A Chinese journalist jailed for nearly eight years after exposing government corruption said Tuesday after being released early for good behavior that he should never have been sent to prison.

"I have mixed feelings," Gao Qinrong, 51, who was sentenced to 13 years in jail in 1999, told AFP by telephone about how he felt to finally be free.

"I'm very excited and happy to see my wife and daughter again after eight years ... on the other hand I feel angry and indignant."

Gao, a journalist for the official Xinhua news agency, was jailed on what media rights groups have said were trumped up charges of corruption and pimping after he accused officials in northern China's Shanxi province of graft.

His expose about a sham irrigation project was reported in the Communist Party's main newspaper, the People's Daily, and made television news bulletins, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

But instead of the officials being held to account, Gao was jailed.

He maintained Tuesday that he was innocent and that he would continue trying to clear his name, although he held out little hope.

"I plan to appeal ... but I think this anti-corruption issue is very difficult. My hopes are dim but I will continue struggling."

Gao said he was not treated badly in jail because authorities also knew he had been set up.

"When I was in prison, every officer and prisoner knew that I was innocent through media reports, so I was treated well there," he said from his home in Shanxi.

Gao was released on December 7 after getting his term reduced for "good behaviour", Reporters Without Borders said in an earlier statement.

"We are delighted at his release but it is important to point out that this journalist has already spent eight years of his life in prison," the international media rights group said.

"Gao Qinrong, who was unfairly sentenced to a very harsh prison term, has already paid very dearly for his work as a journalist investigating the corruption which is poisoning China."

The group also highlighted the plight of 31 other reporters it says are languishing in Chinese jails for simply carrying out their work.

The group ranks China 163rd out of 167 countries on its global press freedom index.

In one of the most high-profile cases recently, Zhao Yan, 44, a Chinese assistant for the New York Times, lost his appeal on December 1 against a three-year sentence on what his family said were trumped up fraud charges.
