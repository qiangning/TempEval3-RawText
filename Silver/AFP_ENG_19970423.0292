Philippine shopping mall giant SM Prime Holdings Inc. said Wednesday it expects net profit to rise 20 percent year-on-year in 1997 to to 2.4 billion pesos (92 million dollars).

Speaking after the company's annual stockholders' meeting, SM Prime vice-president Joseph Sio said the profit would be generated from an increase in leasable space in the company's huge shopping malls.

SM Prime president Henry Sy cited the expansion of existing malls and reconfiguring of the space in the malls and said this would continue during 1997.

The opening of two new malls in the latter half of the year would boost their company's total leasable space by 20 percent, he added.
