Antoine Sibierski scored his first Premiership goal of the season on Saturday to award Newcastle a 1- 0 win over Portsmouth.

The home side were on top from the start and were unfortunate to see Obafemi Martins' first-half goal ruled out for a marginal offside decision.

Newcastle saw more chances go astray before Charles N'Zogbia crossed for substitute Sibierski to slot home in the 69th minute.

Portsmouth offered little going forward and only some fine saves from David James stopped the Magpies adding more.

The win was still a welcome one for Newcastle boss Glenn Roeder as, for all his side's heroics in the UEFA Cup, their domestic form had been a serious cause for concern.

This was their first victory on home turf in the league since the opening day of the season - and Sibierski's goal was only their ninth in 14 top-flight games.

They were never going to get it all their own way here either.
