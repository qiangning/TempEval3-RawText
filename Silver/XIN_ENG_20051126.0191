Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika went to Paris for medical treatment on Saturday after experiencing digestive disorder, his office said in a statement.

Bouteflika received a medical check-up the same day in the capital Algeria "due to digestive disorder" and was later sent to Paris for further treatment on the advice of the doctors who examined him, the statement said.

The statement also quoted the doctors as saying "the president's condition is not a source of concern."

Bouteflika's office said he would now not attend the Euro-Mediterranean summit in Barcelona on Sunday as planned.

Bouteflika, born in March 1937, was elected president in 1998 and secured a second term in office in April 2004.
