Turkey's most notorious mafia leader was sentenced Friday to more than 14 years in jail for a gang-related attack on a cafe but told his relatives "it is not important, do not be sad," the Anatolia news agency said.

Alaattin Cakici was convicted of ordering an armed attack in 2000 that injured 15 people at a cafe frequented by a rival gang, and sentenced to 14 years, nine months and 20 days.

"It is not important. Do not be sad," the 52-year-old told relatives as he was being escorted out of the court building, Anatolia said.

It was the second time the mafia boss had been tried over the attack.

He had already spent three years in jail, but the appeals court overturned part of the ruling and asked that his sentence be increased.

Cakici is a former far-right militant turned mob leader in the 1990s. He claims to have links with the country's intelligence services and to have enjoyed protection by politicians.

Cakici, who was extradited from Austria last year, is indicted in five other cases.

He risks life imprisonment for two of them -- for ordering the murders of his wife 1995 and of four other people, including his former right-hand man, in 1996.

He will also stand trial for his role in the failed privatization of the public Turkbank in 1998, which toppled the government then in power.
