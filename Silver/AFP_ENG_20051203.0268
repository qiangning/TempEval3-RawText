Ukraine on Saturday declared a state of emergency after an H5-type bird flu was detected in its southern Crimea peninsula, as officials awaited tests to see if the strain is of the lethal H5N1 variety that has killed nearly 70 people in Asia.

"Today we received laboratory results that confirmed the existence of the H5 variety of bird flu on Ukrainian territory," Agriculture Minister Olexander Baranivsky told reporters in Kiev.

The virus was found among domestic chickens and geese in two northeastern parts of Crimea, a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea, after more than 1,600 domesticated birds, including chickens, geese, ducks and turkeys, had died in the region during the past three days, Baranivsky said.

Samples had been forwarded to laboratories in Britain and Italy to establish if the virus is of the deadly H5N1 strain, that has killed almost 70 people around Asia over the past two years.

Those who have died are thought to have mainly caught the virus from close contact with poultry, but scientists fear the virus could mutate with a human flu strain, allowing it to transfer between people and sparking a pandemic.

President Viktor Yushchenko, who chaired an emergency government meeting on Saturday, ordered that the affected areas be placed under a state of emergency, according to a statement from his office.

A special commission, headed by Emergencies Minister Viktor Baloga, would be in charge of all bird flu-related measures and would determine the exact areas affected by the state of emergency, it said.

The five Crimean villages where bird flu-affected poultry have been found and areas within three kilometers (1.9 miles) of them were placed under quarantine, and all poultry within them will be destroyed, Baranivsky said.

Special teams would go from house to house, killing birds and testing people for abnormal symptoms, Pyotr Verbitsky, Ukraine's chief veterinary inspector told reporters in the Crimean city of Simferopol.

Sales of live poultry have been banned throughout the peninsula and all people who had come into contact with poultry would undergo regular medical testing and were expected to receive flu vaccination shots, local health officials told reporters in Crimea earlier.

The domestic poultry were likely to have caught the virus after coming into contact with migratory birds, officials said.

The cases are near the Sivash saltwater lake in Crimea's northeast, a popular stopover route for millions of migratory birds from Russia's Siberia and Volga regions, as well as Asia, Verbitsky said.

"The virus is behaving differently than in Russia and Romania," Ukraine's neighbors where bird flu has also been detected, said Verbitsky.

"The sickness passes without any symptoms," he said. "In the evening the birds are healthy and in the morning they are dead."

Although the virulent H5N1 strain has not yet been detected in Ukraine, the country has banned the import of poultry and its derivatives from Croatia, Romania and Turkey, as well as several regions of Russia, along with imports of live wild and pet birds.
