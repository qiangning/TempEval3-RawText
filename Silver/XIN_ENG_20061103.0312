Nigeria aims to export more gas to increase revenues

ABUJA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has planned to export more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to capture significant market shares in the world to increase the nation's revenues, a senior petroleum official said here on Friday.

Funsho Kupolokun, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, told reporters that "the strategy being adopted to capture the market will focus on growing the LNG market and gas export pipelines."

He said a project carried out by the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) "has attracted over 3.6 billion (U.S.) dollars revenues to the country," adding that part of the money had been reinvested for further growth and the country's gas sector.

According to him, the NLNG will contribute a whopping 20 percent of Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2007.

Kupolokun said Train 5 of the country's LNG project was commissioned in December 2005 and the Train 6 was slated for being commissioned in 2008, with the growth forecast for the NLNG capacity of about 30 million tons annually by 2012.

He said the West African Gas Pipeline project would be commissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2007.

The official also disclosed that two additional regional pipelines were under evaluation including the supply to Equatorial Guinea.
