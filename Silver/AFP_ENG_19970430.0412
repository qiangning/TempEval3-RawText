Danish rock singer Maria Montell and Denmark's Prince Frederik are "just friends" and won't be tying the knot, the mass-market Extra Bladet newspaper reported Wednesday.

Montell, 28, scotched rumours of a love affair with the prince, also 28, telling the paper she has "no romantic relationship with Frederik" but that they had become "very good friends."

Montell, irked by the constant media attention and rumours since the friendship became public earlier this year, added: "It's very good too. He is single, so am I. We go out on the town a lot together, but he is not my boyfriend. I have always said that, but nobody wants to hear it."
