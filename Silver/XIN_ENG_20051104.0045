China's southern province Guangdong started to recruit volunteers on Thursday to assist Myanmar's agricultural and sports industries.

Ideal candidates will be college graduates between 25 and 40 years old and proficient in English, said Huang Qinghui, a publicity official and head of the provincial volunteers' association.

"We'll recruit 11 agrotechnicians and four sports professionals specializing in swimming, weight lifting, pingpong and badminton," Huang said. "They will leave on Dec. 5, the International Volunteer's Day, and will spend six months in Myanmar."

He said the volunteer agrotechnicians are expected to help Myanmar farmers raise silkworms, grow quality grapes and improve other plants' species.

This is the first time for Guangdong Province to recruit volunteers for overseas services, entrusted by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and the Ministry of Commerce.

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and the China Association of Youth Volunteers launched a long-term volunteer service project in May 2002 to assist other developing countries.

Chinese volunteers have since offered language and computer training as well as medical services to several countries including Laos, Myanmar and Ethiopia.
