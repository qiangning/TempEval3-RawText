The United Nations nuclear watchdog agency will press ahead with its investigation of Iran's nuclear program, IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei said after the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Tehran.

The International Atomic Energy Agency "will implement the relevant parts of the UNSC (UN Security Council) resolution that relates to its work," Elbaradei said in a statement posted on the IAEA's web site.
