India's tax-cutting reform budget faced fresh trouble Sunday when a communist partner in the ousted coalition challenged the caretaker government's right to pass it in parliament.

The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) said the United Front, which was voted out Friday and holds office in a caretaker capacity, had no constitutional authority to pass the budget for the year to March 1998.

"Once the government is ousted, then its budget proposals become defunct," said Ashok Mitra, a senior CPI-M member.

"President Shankar Dayal Sharma should ask the government to instead approve a vote-on-account.

"This is my party's view," he added.

A vote-on-account is a constitutional alternative to a fully-fledged budget and will help parliament to approve the government's expenditure.

Indian officials said on Saturday parliament would ratify the budget later this month despite the dramatic fall of the country's coalition government.

They said major political parties had agreed to set aside their differences and pass the budget during a special three-day parliamentary session beginning April 21. India's financial year begins April 1.

But Mitra insisted a vote-on-account was the only solution.

"The caretaker government cannot oppose or amend the budget proposals," said Mitra, a former finance minister in the communist- ruled state of West Bengal.

The CPI-M is a key constituent of the centre-left United Front and has been a constant critic of New Delhi's free-market economic reforms.

Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram's widely-acclaimed pro-reform budget, unveiled in parliament on February 28, slashed taxes and promised to reduce the fiscal deficit.

The personal tax rate was slashed from 40 to 30 percent, to the cheers of the rich, while corporate tax for domestic firms was reduced from 40 to 35 percent.

Chidambaram's proposals delighted Indian stock markets, with the barometer 30-share index on the Bombay Stock Exchange shooting up 6.3 percent on the same day.

The index has been on a rollercoaster ride since March 30 when the Congress (I) party withdrew support for the government, sparking the chain of events which culminated with the fall of Deve Gowda's United Front coalition Friday.

Deve Gowda has been asked by the president to continue as caretaker prime minister until further notice.

The speaker of the Indian lower house of parliament has warned the country would be plunged into a financial crisis if the budget was not passed before the deadline of May 14.

Under Indian law, the budget has to be ratified in parliament within 75 days of being unveiled. If that does not happen, the provisions of the previous budget remain in force.

Meanwhile, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party) said it would form a three-member panel to suggest amendments to Chidambaram's tax proposals in the budget.

"We cannot support the budget blindly," BJP treasurer V.P. Goel said.

A BJP ideologue, Jay Dubashi, said: "The panel will meet next week to thrash out an agenda to suggest changes in the finance bill. And we will ask the caretaker government to comply.

"We will not mind being voted down on these suggestions. The idea is to present our viewpoint," Dubashi said.
