One U.S. soldier has been killed and two others wounded when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle in Diyala province north of Baghdad, the U.S. military said on Sunday.

"A Task Force Lightning Soldier assigned to 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, was killed and two others were wounded when an improvised explosive device detonated near their vehicle while they were conducting operations in Diyala Province Saturday, " the military said in a statement.

Earlier in the day, the military said that two more U.S. marines died from wounds sustained due to "enemy action" in separate incidents in Iraq's volatile Anbar province on Saturday.

Since the U.S.-led war in Iraq broke out in March 2003, about 2, 875 U.S. soldiers have been killed in the war-torn country, according to media count.
