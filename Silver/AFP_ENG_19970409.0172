Iran warned Wednesday of a threat to relations with Germany over the outcome of a trial of five men accused of the murder of Iranian Kurd opposition leaders in Berlin, but pledged to protect German lives and interests here regardless.

On Tuesday, the German foreign ministry advised its nationals against travelling to Iran because of anxiety over a possible negative verdict Thursday in the trial of one Iranian and four Lebanese accused of killing four Kurd leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992.

But Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a press conference here: "Any speculation on such threats is pure fantasy.

"Iran has always demonstrated a dignified attitude in its foreign relations, even if subjected to hostile acts," Velayati said.

"In our foreign policy, we always take into account our interests and Islamic dignity and decency," he added. "They are suffering from illusions to think the whole world is going to crumble down because of this affair."

Around 500 German nationals, including diplomats, live in Iran.

German prosecutors have linked Iranian political and spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani with the 1992 assassinations.

A warrant has already been issued for Iranian intelligence minister Ali Fallahian, who is accused of ordering the killings.

The affair has deeply strained ties between Iran and its main trade partner Germany, and the prosecutors' charges provoked angry reactions in Iran, including massive protests in front of the German embassy last November.

Referring to the trial, Velayati said his country would "wait and see" the outcome of the "unfortunate situation."

Apparently forecasting problems with Bonn in the event Tehran is condemned by the court, he said Iran had "no need" of relations with a country which makes it trample on its Islamic dignity and principles."

"Future relations depend on Germany. We want good relations based on mutual respect and equal rights. But a friendship can not be one- sided, or it can not last," he said.

But Velayati acknowledged that the German government is "independent" of its judiciary. "This we know. What we have objections to is why the Berlin court has not preserved its independence and become politicized."

"How can they use some fugitive and criminals like Bani Sadre as a witness? A witness should be unbiased" he said, referring to exiled former Iranian president Abolhassan Bani Sadre.

"This is a malicious political act. The court is tainted with political considerations," he said.

Iran, meanwhile, is taking its own measures against Germany, planning to sue 24 German firms which allegedly supplied Iraq with chemical weapons technology during its 1980-1988 war with the Islamic republic and "certain" German officials who approved such exports.

The Iranian judiciary said Monday the defendants would be called to appear in a Tehran court shortly following complaints from more than 1,000 relatives of victims of chemical attacks during the war.

In an unexpected move, the Iranian parliament's foreign relations subcommittee discussed late Tuesday prospects for future relations with Bonn, but postponed any decision pending more information.

The German government said Monday the outcome of the trial could lead to a complete review of relations with Iran.

Iranian newspapers have also stepped up pressure on Germany, warning its judiciary against issuing any verdict biased against Iran.

"Iranian workers are following the case with special sensitivity. In case of a biased verdict, we won't remain silent," warned Kar-va- Kargar, a radical daily representing the state labor union.

The union staged street protests against Germany in November.
