U.S. stocks ended higher on Monday, as crude oil prices dived to near 59 dollars.

In the closing trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 23.45, or 0.19 percent, to 12,131.88. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 3.52, or 0.25 percent, at 1,384.42, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 16.66, or 0.70 percent, at 2,406.38..

Crude oil prices fell to near 59 dollars on Monday amid warm winter concern, after the International Energy Agency cut its oil product demand growth forecast for 2006.

Crude futures have fallen more than 25 percent from its record 78.40 dollars per barrel in mid-July. Low energy prices would boost corporate profits and consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity.
