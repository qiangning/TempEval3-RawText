The African Union (AU) is to extend the mandate of its peacekeeping force in Sudan's Darfur region for six months, an AU delegate said here on Thursday.

The delegate, who is participating in the AU's peace and security council meeting in Nigerian capital Abuja, said the commander of the AU force would be appointed by the AU after consultations with the United Nations and the Sudanese government, which has declined the deployment of UN peacekeepers in Darfur.

The AU Peace and Security Council agreed in September to extend the mandate of its forces in Darfur to the end of this year with the helps to be provided by the UN and the international society.
