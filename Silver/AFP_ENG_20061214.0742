Two astronauts on Thursday completed the second spacewalk in the space shuttle Discovery's 12-day mission to refurbish the International Space Station, NASA said.

Mission specialist Robert Curbeam and Christer Fuglesang, Sweden's first astronaut, remained outside the ISS exactly five hours rewiring the space station for a new solar array that will double its power output.

The astronauts completed all their tasks ahead of schedule, NASA said. The potentially risky work involved shutting off the electricity to half the space station to prevent the astronauts from getting electrocuted.
