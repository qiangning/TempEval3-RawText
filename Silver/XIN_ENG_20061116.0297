The Algerian government is committed to establish strong and diverse ties with Zimbabwe to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries, a diplomat said on Thursday.

Business community in Zimbabwe should utilize the full potential of business opportunities offered by the excellent political, diplomatic and historic relations that exist between the two countries, urged Algerian ambassador to Zimbabwe Ali Mokrani when speaking at a celebration in Harare to mark the 52 anniversary of the Algerian revolution which ended 132 years of French colonization.

In the spirit of cooperation between Zimbabwe and Algeria, the two countries drafted agreements in all economic areas to facilitate increased business activity and trade between the two countries.

Algeria also extended solidarity with Zimbabwe through the provision of scholarships, food aid and medical donations.

At continental level, ambassador Mokrani said his country believed that Africans should pool their resources together to tackle head on the challenges resulting from globalization and enhance trade rather than aid.

Speaking on behalf of the Zimbabwean government at the occasion, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Obert Matshalaga said it was imperative to conclude negotiations on trade and convene the joint commission.

He spoke of the need to broaden and deepen bilateral relations in the economic, technical and cultural areas and at continental and global levels through the African union, the non-aligned movement and the UN.
