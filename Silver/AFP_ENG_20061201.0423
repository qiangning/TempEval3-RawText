A suspected militant died Friday when explosives he was carrying on a motorcycle blew up in a high-security zone of Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar, police said.

The blast happened in a garrison area of the border town, within a kilometre (just over half a mile) of the US consulate and military intelligence buildings, police chief Habibur Rehman told AFP.

"A lone motorcyclist aged about 32 years old was driving in the area then there was a loud explosion and he died. The ID card found from his says he was a resident of Peshawar," Rehman said.

The police chief said it was "difficult to say at this moment whether it was a suicide bombing", although provincial police chief Riffat Pasha indicated it was not.

"It appears that he was taking explosives somewhere else. It was a sensitive area -- he was within a one kilometre radius of the US Consulate and military intelligence," Rehman added.

Pasha said the police had established the identity of the bomber, but would not give details saying that he did not want to compromise investigations.

The bomb was fitted to the motorcycle with the intention of leaving it somewhere to explode, he said. It was also a low-intensity device so the damage was limited.

Another local police official said the explosion took place close to a high-security residential area for the officials of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan's feared spy agency.
