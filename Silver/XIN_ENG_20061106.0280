Thailand's Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont Monday ordered that assistance and rehabilitation work for the flood victims must be completed in all flood-ravaged areas within three months.

During a three-hour meeting with Cabinet ministers and 15 central province governors at a Monday videoconference, the premier ordered government agencies to speed up assistance to flood victims and disburse compensation as appropriate.

Farmers whose lands carried excess waters to relieve Bangkok's flood threat will be given a high priority. He set a deadline to finish the task within three months, starting from November 15.

Surayud suggested to adopt raft-building techniques for houses in flood-prone areas so that in case of future floods the houses can float during high water periods.

The prime minister instructed the Armed Forces Development Command (AFDC) to apply its engineering expertise to major projects, and told officials to publicize governmental assistance so the public knows the government is serious about helping the people.

Permanent Secretary for Interior Pongpayom Wasaputi said his ministry will ask the Cabinet Tuesday to urgently pay 25 percent of compensation money to villagers affected by the floods.

If the Cabinet gives the go ahead, the government can proceed to pay the first round of compensation to flood victims immediately.

Prime Minister Surayud also set up a committee to direct and follow-up assistance to flood victims, Government Spokesman Yongyuth Mayalarp told the Thai News Agency after the meeting.
