Pace bowler Darren Gough has got England cricket back to winning ways -- but only by carrying off top prize on a television ballroom dancing talent contest.

Gough, 35, who opted out of England's ongoing tour to Pakistan, danced his way to victory in BBC television's "Strictly Come Dancing", beating former 110 metres hurdles world record holder Colin Jackson into second place.

The hugely popular Saturday night variety show -- last year's final pulled in 10.6 million viewers -- has featured former sports stars, television news readers, actresses and celebrity chefs.

Twelve celebrities with limited or no dance experience are taken through their paces by professional dancers before performing in front of a panel of experienced dance judges.

A weekly public phone vote then decides who stays or goes.

Gough, wearing a black shirt and trousers with silver sequinned braces rather than his customary cricket whites, said he was delighted with the win, and praised his partner and teacher Lilia Kopylova.

"I thought I would be saying this 10 weeks ago but it has been an amazing journey for a guy who has never danced," he said.

"She (Lilia) has turned me into some sort of dancer. I cannot believe I had the confidence to do that tonight. I could not have wished for a better partner."
