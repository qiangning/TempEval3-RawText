Shaquille O'Neal will undergo knee surgery and be out of the Miami Heat lineup for four to six weeks, according to the NBA club from Miami on Friday.

The thirteen-time NBA All-Star O'Neal, who has no date been set for the operation, has struggled to stay on the court in recent campaigns. He has missed four of Miami's first eight contests this season with a bruised left knee.

Team medical personnel determined that it was more than a bruise and recommended surgery after an MRI revealled torn cartilage.

O'Neal suffered the injury when he collided with Houston Rockets forward Chuck Hayes in a November 12 game.

Last season, O'Neal missed 23 games with an assortment of injuries but returned to help lead Miami to its first NBA title.

The former MVP is averaging 14.0 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.0 block in 30.8 minutes per game this season.
