Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoom said on Tuesday that the movement's position on recognition of Israel remained unchanged.

But such a position of Hamas, a political faction, has not to be identical with the position of a new Palestinian government, Barhoom said, referring to an Israeli report that the coming government would not recognize a two-state solution, because it includes recognition of Israel.

He said that the new government would be formed based on a prisoners' document.

Hamas refuses to recognize Israel and is sworn to the Jewish state's destruction. The document, however, recognizes a two-state solution.

Leaders of rival Hamas and Fatah movements are holding dialogue on details concerning formation of a new national unity government to end economic and political crises in the Palestinian territory.

Recognizing Israel, honoring previous agreements with Israel and renouncing violence are requirements of the Quartet Committee to lift siege on the Palestinians and resume financial aid.
