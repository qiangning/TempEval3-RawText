While Italy prepares to lead a multinational force to Albania, it has given a mixed welcome to the influx of refugees who have fled across the Adriatic from the stricken Balkan nation.

Since March 13, around 13,000 Albanians have arrived in Italy by boat to rejoin their 64,000 compatriots there, according to officials.

The Albanian immigrant community is second only in size in Italy to the Moroccan community, estimated to number some 119,000.

Albania has been gripped by instability since anti-government protests over the collapse of bogus investment schemes turned into armed rebellion as insurgents took control of a string of towns in the south.

Amid the anarchy, and given that Albania was already Europe's poorest country, many people are desperate to escape, anywhere and anyhow.

A bid by one group to sail across to Italy ended in tragedy last week, when their tug boat collided with an Italian naval ship. Four people were drowned and scores more reported missing, presumed dead.

The influx of refugees, who have been put up in 40 reception centres, has sparked protests.

The mayors of some cities, particularly the more affluent ones in the north, have refused to host refugees. The separatist Northern League has already warned that they will bring disease to the region.

"The delinquents should be thrown back into the sea," complained Irene Pivetti, the former speaker of the lower house of parliament.

The tug boat drama "proved me right," she insisted. "These women and children were taken hostage by unscrupulous criminals. The refugees must return home."

Roberto Rambaldi, a top official with the Catholic humanitarian agency Caritas, said: "There is a hidden racism in Italy, an underlined xenophobia."

Many of the immigrants were considered "liars or burglers," he said, even though they often did work that Italians did not want, such as labouring in fields or looking after the elderly.

"Albania is a violent country which has been a fulcrum of oil and arms trafficking (toward the former Yugoslavia)," he added, "where it was easy to make money."

But the main problem was the link between organised crime in Albania and Greece and the Italian Mafia, especially in prostitution and child exploitation.

"How can a country of 57 million people, the fifth economy in the world, be afraid of thousands of refugees?" asked Luigi Manconi, spokesman of the Green party.

Left-wing and anti-racist organisations plan to hold a rally Sunday in the souther port of Brindisi in a show of solidarity with the refugees.
