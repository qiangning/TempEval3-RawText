The OSCE's troubleshooter on Albania, Franz Vranitzky, said Wednesday he believes general elections will take place in the troubled country "before summer."

The exact date should be fixed "in the next 10 days," he said.

Up to now, plans for the elections -- to be organised and supervised by the Organisation for Security and Coorperation in Europe -- have been stuck on whether votes should be counted on the current majority basis, as President Sali Berisha wants, or on a proportional basis, as wished by Prime Minister Bashkim Fino.

Vranitzky, who has headed the European security body's mission to Albania since its inception March 27, said he believed the present, majority system can be applied again, with a little "perfecting."

"Whether the elections take place June 29 or July 6 is not important," Vranitzky told Austria's APA news agency in Vienna.

He also added that the way food aid was being handed out, under the protection of soldiers from the multinational protection force, was penalising the poor in Albania.

The country itself "isn't suffering from a shortage of food or other products, but from a bad distribution system," he said.
