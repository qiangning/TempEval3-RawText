Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse, who was celebrating his first year in office, said Sunday that his government would pursue its struggle in tackling the threat of terrorism posed by the Tamil Tiger rebels and would not be cowed down by it.

Rajapakse made the remarks while addressing a public gathering at the launching of the construction of the island's second international airport at Weerawila, 255 kms from the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo, in the deep southern district of Hambantota.

Rajapakse, who was also celebrating his first year in office on Sunday, said "A terrorist group who claimed all powerful has now been limited to 4 or 5 villages in the eastern province", referring to the military victories against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.

The president said that he has kept the pledge made at last November's presidential election not to lower the esteem of the country's security forces.

Rajapakse in his election campaign was critical of the Norwegian-backed peace process with the Tiger rebels, which he claimed was giving in too much to the Tigers and the forces have been humiliated by it.

The Sri Lankan President said in his address that despite action against the Tiger rebels in the battle fields of north and east, the rights of the peace-loving Tamil people must be safeguarded.

Rajapakse's first year in office was dominated by its military campaign against the LTTE who accuse the Sri Lankan president of leading a secret war against them while saying that his government was supportive of the Norwegian-backed peace process to end the island's long drawn out separatist armed conflict.
