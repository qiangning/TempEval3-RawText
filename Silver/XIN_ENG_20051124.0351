Cambodia ranked second in the world's 84 countries in clearing land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO according to the latest annual Landmine Monitor Report from the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.

With 32 square kilometers of land cleared of mines and UXO in 2004, Cambodia ranks second in the world when it comes to clearing land from the lethal explosives, The Cambodia Daily quoted the report as saying on Friday.

Denise Coghlan, research officer from Cambodian Campaign to Ban Landmines, said that although more could be done to rid Cambodia of mines, being second out of 84 affected countries was a good sign.

According to the report released on Wednesday, 154 countries including Cambodia have now signed the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty banning stockpiling, producing and transferring landmines.

As a signatory, Cambodia is bound to clear all of its land of mines and UXO by 2010, Coghlan said.

Mine Action and Injury Prevention Coordinator for Handicap International Christian Provoost said that clearing Cambodia of mines in the near future is not a realistic goals.

"If they want to clear everything it will take 150 years more," he said.

Kem Sophoan, director of the government's Cambodian Mine Action Center, said that the highest priority in de-mining was to clear the heavily mined areas along the Thai-Cambodian border.

The Cambodian Mine/UXO Information System's latest report shows that mines or UXO injured or killed 36 in October, bringing the total number of dead or injured so far in 2005 to 775.

Cambodia is one of the world's most-heavily mined counties with an estimated four to six million of the hidden killers buried in its soil during the country's nearly three decades of civil conflicts.
