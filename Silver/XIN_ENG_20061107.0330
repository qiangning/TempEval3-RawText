The European Commission has cleared the proposed acquisition of U.S.-based Intermagnetics by Philips, said the commission on Tuesday.

The commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area (EEA) - the 25 European Union (EU) member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - or any substantial part of it.

Philips markets a wide range of electrical and electronic products, such as lighting products, domestic appliances, consumer electronics, semiconductors and medical systems, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems.

Intermagnetics manufactures magnets and radio-frequency used in MRI, as well as patient monitors, computer-aided detection systems and so-called functional MRI.

In particular, Intermagnetics currently supplies radio- frequency coils to Philips and several other MRI system manufacturers. Thus, the commission analyzed whether the proposed transaction would enable the new entity to disrupt the supply of coils and to hinder its competitors to compete effectively on the market for MRI systems.

The market investigation has shown that these risks are minimal, mainly due to economic incentives and the presence of several other suppliers of coils for MRI systems, said the commission.
