Europe threw its weight Thursday behind a timetable for getting stricken Albania back on to its feet, firming up its support for an aid operation and early elections.

In return, Albanian Premier Bashkim Fino, meeting here with top EU and OSCE officials, pledged to step up dialogue with the armed rebels who have held the south of the country for more than a month in their bid to oust President Sali Berisha.

"We are convinced that the June elections can be held with being hampered by the armed groups," said Greek Foreign Minister Theodore Pangalos, referring to the polls which, it is hoped, will drag Albania out of crisis and into compromise.

"We must support our Albanian friends so that they can get back on their feet" by the time of June elections, said Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe envoy Franz Vranitzky, after talks with Fino, Pangalos and EU envoy Hans van Mierlo.

A key element of efforts to pull Albania back from the brink involves the dispatch of a multinational force of up to 5,000 troops to shore up security while aid is brought into the chaotic Balkan state.

But Vranitzky warned that a launch date of April 12 proposed for the military mission could be optimistic.

"April 12 is a date we're all working toward. Perhaps it's optimistic, but if it is delayed by five days it won't be a catastrophe," he said. "What we want now is to work as closely together as possible."

In Paris, a French foreign ministry spokesman said a steering committee of representatives of nations contributing to the force -- Austria, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey -- would meet Friday in Rome.

Pangalos said for his part that the force, due to comprise between 700 and 800 Greek troops, "will not be tasked with disarmament." Instead the Italian-led mission is expected to secure roads, junctions, airports and warehouses and help aid deliveries.

Fino, who later returned to Tirana, said after Thursday's talks that the dispatch of the force marked a key stage in the preparations for the June elections.

And he stressed that he would increase dialogue with the southern rebels and the self-styled committees which are currently running a string of southern towns in a bid to restore "peace and calm" after a month of anarchy.

Albania descended into chaos after protests over the collapse of bogus investment schemes boiled over into a full-blown rebellion. Duped investors and criminal elements armed themselves and called for the resignation of President Berisha, whom they blamed for the financial implosion.

Vranitzky, a former Austrian chancellor, said the OSCE and EU help would be based around three pillars.

The European Union would provide economic and humanitarian aid, the OSCE would help restore democracy, and Italy would lead the multinational force.

Vranitzky said: "None of these pillars can stand by themselves, they are inter-dependent."

"We must restore a decent life, otherwise there can't be public order, and if public order is not restored, elections and democracy won't be possible, and all that must be protected by the very prudent action of a multinational force," Vranitzky said.

More than 13,000 refugees have crossed the Adriatic for Italy, though scores were feared drowned last week when a refugee boat collided with an Italian naval ship.

On Thursday, the first refugees arrived in Italy since that calamity, as a boat with 53 escapees docked in the southern port of Brindisi. Meanwhile, a Russian cargo vessel in the southern Adriatic picked up around 20 Albanian refugees navigating the waters in a rubber dinghy.
