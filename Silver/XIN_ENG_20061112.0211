Arsenal put on a scintillating performance to thrash Liverpool 3-0 at home on Sunday and keep in touch with the Premiership pace-setters.

Mathieu Flamini put Arsenal ahead from close range five minutes before the end of an evenly contested first half.

But Arsenal moved into top gear after the interval, Kolo Toure racing on to Robin van Persie's clever pass to slide home a cool finish after 56 minutes.

William Gallas was then left completely unmarked to head in Van Persie's corner to seal the win with 10 minutes left.

Liverpool's title hopes were slim before kick-off but they are now surely non-existent as they remain without an away win in the Premiership this season.

Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had a throat infection, which allowed Manuel Almunia to make a rare start.

Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez persisted with Steven Gerrard in a right-wing role, despite the absence of injured Momo Sissoko, so Bolo Zenden played in central midfield alongside Xabi Alonso.

It was to prove a questionable decision, with Gerrard very much a peripheral figure as Arsenal ran out comfortable winners.
