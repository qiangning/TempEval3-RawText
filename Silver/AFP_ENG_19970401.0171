A former Indian member of parliament Tuesday offered to forego what remained of 114,300 dollars in bribes allegedly paid to him during a vote-buying scandal materminded by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.

Ajay Burman, counsel for Shailendra Mahato, a leader of a tribal party, told a New Delhi court: "Since it is bribe money paid to my client to get his support for the government during the 1993 no- confidence motion and does not belong to him, it can be confiscated."

Mahato, accused with three other Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM, Jharkhand Liberation Front) politicians of accepting bribes in return for voting for the government in a no-confidence motion in 1993, has agreed to act as a prosecution witness in the affair.

Police found 62,800 dollars in Mahato's account when they froze it in July last year.

Earlier he said that current Congress president Sitaram Kesri, who replaced Rao as party chief and who is currently trying to form a coalition government, knew about the bribes.

Mahato said members of parliament were promised five million rupees (143,000 dollars) each for their votes and three million rupees (85,700 dollars) if they abstained.

The JMM leaders also claimed that Rao promised to back their demand for a tribal homeland in eastern India if they sided with his government.

The prosecution Tuesday said Mahato was unreliable and only making a confession to try and avoid a prison sentence.

Rao, 75, was charged in the case in October. The former prime minister, who held office between 1991 and 1996, currently faces trial in two other corruption cases.

He quit as Congress president and parliamentary leader last year after pressure from his colleagues.
