A suicide attacker ploughed a car bomb into a police checkpoint protecting Baghdad University on Wednesday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 30 more, medical officials said.

Shortly afterwards another car bomb killed four people and wounded seven when it exploded outside a government passport office in the Kasr neighbourhood in the north of the city, according to a security official.

Medics at the war-torn Iraqi capital's Yarmuk and Ibn Nafis hospitals said most of the casualties in the campus attack were students, while a security official said three national police officers were killed and seven wounded.

"People were hopping over and treading on bodies as they scattered to get away," said a young man who fled the scene.

The explosion took place on a major road leading through the Karrada area, a once prosperous part of Baghdad which was known as one of the most mixed areas of the city but is now increasingly dominated by Shiites.

Baghdad's universities have come increasingly under attack from Sunni extremist groups, and last week an Internet statement purportedly from the Ansar al-Sunna militant organisation explicitly threatened students.

Both attacks came as Baghdad remained trapped in a vicious cycle of sectarian killings led by warring Sunni insurgent groups and Shiite militias.
