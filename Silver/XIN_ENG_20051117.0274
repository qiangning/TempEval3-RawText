Egypt's ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) and the Muslim Brotherhood, a powerful opposition group, have showed their political strength as the first phase of Egypt's parliamentary elections ended.

After the first round of voting held last Wednesday and Tuesday 's run-offs, the NDP won a total of 112 seats out of 164, up for grab in the first phase of the three-stage legislative polls, according to the latest results announced by elections officials Thursday.

The number included some 30 NDP renegades, who failed to appear on the party-sanctioned candidates list and ran as independents, but rejoined the party before the final results came out.

The Muslim Brotherhood took 34 seats, while other opposition parties and groups won just five seats. The remaining 13 seats went to independents.

"Results of the first phase of the parliamentary elections are quite interesting," Hassan Nafi'a, an Egyptian political analyst, said, adding "there are some surprising things but they are not too far beyond expectation."

"The NDP confirmed its grip to power and the Muslim Brotherhood showed its strength," he said, "meanwhile, the so-called secular opposition groups fared rather poorly."

Egypt's traditional opposition parties, including the newly- formed National United Front for Change and the Al Ghad party, are both losing their ground after failing to score major wins.

The NDP, the largest political party in Egypt, holds 404 seats in the outgoing 454-member People's Assembly. Its dominance in the legislative polls is widely expected given to its highly organized party machine and vast resources at its disposal.

The party has been implementing an internal restructuring plan in the past years, making itself appear to be more like a modern ruling political party.

Campaigning under the slogan "new thinking, across into the future," the NDP promises comprehensive political and economic reforms in the coming years.

The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's de facto largest opposition group, has also achieved some major gains in the first phase of the parliamentary elections.

With two other phases of elections yet to open, the group has already doubled its representation of 17 seats in the outgoing 454- member People's Assembly.

The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, was outlawed as Egypt' s constitution banned political parties based on religion, but the group renounced violence decades ago and has been largely tolerated by the government.

The first phase of Egypt's three-stage parliamentary election kicked off last Wednesday in 82 constituencies across eight governorates, including Cairo.

The second and third stages will be held on Nov. 20 and Dec. 1 respectively. Any run-offs, if necessary, will be held six days after each round of voting.

"The first phase of the parliamentary elections only confirms perceptions of many Egypt's politics will be increasingly polarized by the competition between the ruling party and its strong Islamist challenger," Nafi'a analyzed.

"Small fish have to fight hard for survival," he added, referring to traditional and small opposition parties.
