Ekranas, the only manufacturer of television picture tubes in the Baltic states, has submitted a complaint to the European Commission (EC) over rivals from Latin America and Asia dumping products on the EU market.

Manufacturers of color picture tubes from Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand are "dumping" their products on the market of European Union (EU), complained Ekranas, whose headquarters is in Panevezhs, a city in northern Lithuania.

At the end of June this year, Ekranas requested that the EC, the EU's executive arm, investigate unfair competition from manufacturers of 14-inch picture tubes from India and South Korea.

The anti-dumping cases could be Ekranas's last chance of survival, as its turnover stood at 228.6 million litas (79.51 million US dollars) from January to September this year, with a loss of 60.7 million litas (21.11 million US dollars).

Its sales volume and net profit in 2004 were 467.2 million litas (162.5 million US dollars) and 1.3 million litas (452,173 dollars) respectively.

Ekranas holds about 25 percent of the EU market for color picture tubes. It plans to manufacture 5.3 million TV picture tubes this year.
