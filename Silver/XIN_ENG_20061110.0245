The French economy came to a halt in the third quarter of the year, stagnating from the second quarter when it climbed 1.2 percent, French national statistics office Insee announced on Friday.

France's gross domestic product registered no growth compared with the April-June period, casting doubt on a government target of economic growth of 2.3 percent this year, Insee data showed on Friday.

Industrial production had fallen in September by 0.9 percent compared with August after a rise of 0.9 percent in August from July.

The drop tracked the fortunes of the auto industry. PSA peugeot Citroen, Europe's second-biggest carmaker, cut its profit target on Oct. 26 for the second time since July, as European sales slumped for models such as 307 compact and the 407 midsized sedan.

The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for French growth next year to 2.3 percent, with an estimate of 2.5 percent this year. In 2005, the growth was 1.2 percent.
