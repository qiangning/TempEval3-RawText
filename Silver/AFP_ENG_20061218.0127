German Economy Minister Michael Glos said in a newspaper interview Monday that he had full confidence in the management of engineering giant Siemens, currently at the centre of a bribery and embezzlement probe.

"I still have every confidence in Siemens' management," Glos told the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

But he added: "The case of Siemens is very unfortunate and clearly shows that many control instruments either weren't installed or didn't function."

Last month, prosecutors launched a massive probe at Siemens, raiding the offices and homes of a number of Siemens employees amid suspicions of embezzlement, bribery and tax evasion.

Prosecutors allege that the employees concerned are suspected of collaborating to open slush fund accounts abroad and of operating a system to embezzle company money.

Prosecutors put the sum held in the accounts at 200 million euros (262 million dollars) and some of that money may have been used as bribes to obtain contracts abroad.

A number of arrest warrants were issued against seven current and former employees, two of whom have since been released.

Last week, the Munich prosecutor's office announced that Thomas Ganswindt, former head of Siemens' information and communications unit, had been detained as part of the investigation.

In a weekend newspaper interview, Siemens supervisory board chief Heinrich von Pierer said he had no intention of stepping down over the deepening scandal.

"I will not resign. For me, the question doesn't arise, because I have nothing to feel guilty about," von Pierer told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
