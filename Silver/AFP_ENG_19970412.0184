The new Pakistani government hopes to double the country's exports in the next three years, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said Sunday.

The aim will be achieved by increasing production, improving product quality and ensuring timely shipments, Aziz told reporters.

Exporters and manufacturers are being encouraged to adhere strictly to international quality standards, he said.

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who took power in February after the national elections, has made the economy his top priority and announced incentives including tax cuts for industry.

The country faces a trade deficit of around 3 billion dollars and a budget deficit of 4 billion dollars during the fiscal 1996-97 ending June 30 next, the finance minister said.

Over the past nine months, of the current fiscal year, the exports stood at 6.129 billion dollars, up from 5.928 billion dollars in the corresponding period last year.
