Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya said Monday that Iran has pledged about 250 million dollars in aid to his cash-strapped Hamas-led government.

"My visit to the Islamic republic achieved (a pledge of) aid of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars," Haniya told Dubai-based Al-Arabiya satellite television in remarks broadcast Monday.

Tehran has allocated 120 million dollars to the Palestinian government for 2007, in addition to committing to pay the salaries of civil servants in three ministries for the coming six months, said Haniya, who has just made a four-day visit to the Islamic republic.

Iran has also "adopted" 100,000 Palestinian workers, who will receive 100 dollars a month each for the next six months, a total of 60 million dollars.

Iran will also disburse 100 dollars a month over the next six months to 3,000 Palestinian fishermen who have been unable to work for a long time, added Haniya, who is now in Sudan.

Hamas is seeking to bolster ties with its regional allies as it desperately tries to replenish Palestinian coffers after Western countries froze aid when the party took office after an upset January election win.

Haniya, on his first trip to Iran as prime minister, met on Sunday with supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

His visit came after the collapse of talks between Hamas and the secular Fatah faction of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on forming a government of national unity that would lead to ending the aid blockade.

Iran, like Haniya's Islamist Hamas party, refuses to recognize Israel.

In November, Palestinian foreign minister Mahmud Zahar said during a visit to Tehran that Iran had already donated 120 million dollars to the Palestinians.

Hamas is at odds with the Fatah party of moderate Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who said he plans to call early parliamentary and presidential elections to resolve the crisis.
