Malaysia's ex-deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim Sunday said debates over Islam's role in the nation had become divisive and "worrying", in statements marking his full-time return to politics here.

The comments from Anwar, who also said he will contest the next elections, come amidst growing tensions between Malaysia's majority Muslim Malays and minority Chinese and Indians.

"The worrying thing is the Muslims feel their position and their power, including the religious courts, are being eroded," Anwar told reporters on the sidelines of a forum of Muslim scholars and activists.

"The non-Muslims feel that they are being marginalised and discriminated against," he said.

Malaysia is seen as a moderate Muslim-majority nation, but race relations have been strained by a series of controversial court cases involving the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims, and questions over which group takes precedence.

The government has banned activists from discussing religious rights and called on the media to stop highlighting race-related issues.

"We have come to the stage where it is considered to be unhealthy," Anwar said, asked about debates on the perceived Islamisation of Malaysia.

"The position by the prime minister and the government to deny the rights of non-Muslims ... or deny an open public discourse on the subjects ... have exacerbated the entire problem," he said.

Anwar, 59, has criss-crossed betweeen Malaysia and overseas destinations since his release from prison in 2004 on sodomy and corruption charges, including the United States, where he was a professor with Georgetown University.

But Anwar, who returned permanently to Malaysia earlier this month, said he had finished his tenure and announced his full-time return to politics here.

Asked if he will contest elections to be a member of parliament in late 2008, he replied: "Of course. It's my right, which they used the courts to deny."
