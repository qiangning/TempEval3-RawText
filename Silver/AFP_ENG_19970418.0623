Police prepared for new efforts Saturday to track down a suspected serial killer after the discovery of more dumped human body parts near this southern Belgian town.

The latest remains, comprising a thigh, an arm, a forearm and a hand, were found in three bags Friday by municipal workers cleaning drains in a residential area of Havre, a suburb of Mons, public prosecutor Pierre Honore said.

The macabre find brought to 15 the total number of garbage bags to turn up in the area since March 22. All the others contained neatly- severed female body parts, except for one stuffed with clothing.

They add up to between four and six suspected victims of a murderer being dubbed the "killer of Mons." Only one so far has been identified, thanks to a tattoo.

She was Martine Bohn, a 43-year-old French prostitute living locally, whose torso had already been fished out of a river in July last year.

Honore said late Friday that like the earlier remains, the limbs would be sent for analysis by forensic experts in Liege.

The police probe would be intensified Saturday, he added.

The chain of finds began on March 22 with nine garbage bags in the suburb of Couesmes, containing the limbs of three women. Another bag, holding the upper part of a torso, turned up nearby two days later.

Two supermarket bags containing a foot, an ankle and the head of a woman aged between 35 and 40 were found in Havre on April 12.

Honore's department has also been in contact with French prosecutors just over the border in Valenciennes, to see if there is any link with the pelvis of a still-unidentified woman's body found in January 1996 at Chateau l'Abbaye, northern France.

The search for a pattern in the killer's operations has uncovered a dark twist in his choice of dumping grounds for the bags.

Apparently playing a cat-and-mouse game, the killer has left the remains of his victims in places with suggestive names: Rue du Depot (Dump) near the River Haine (Hate), on Chemin de l'Inquietude (Worry) and the banks of the River Trouille (Jitters).

The latest finds were in an area known as La Poudriere, or the Powder- keg.

Belgian police are under heavy pressure to solve the killings in the wake of strong parliamentary criticism of bungled investigations into missing children kidnapped by a suspected paedophile ring.

Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene Friday promised disciplinary axction against those responsible for mishandling the cases.
