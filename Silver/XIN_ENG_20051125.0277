Doug Christie was waived by the Dallas Mavericks on Friday, reports from Miami said.

Christie, 35, left the team last week to have his surgically repaired left ankle examined by a personal physician. The team signed Christie to a three-year contract this past offseason, but only $3.15 million in salary was guaranteed.

"We appreciate the effort Doug gave us," Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was quoted said Friday by e-mail. "He went through a lot to get back. Unfortunately, it didn't work out."

Christie's agent, Bradley Marshall, did not immediately comment after the team announced its move.

Christie averaged 3.7 points and 2.0 assists in seven games, all starts, this season for Dallas, who was in Miami to play the Heat Friday night. He joined the team after Orlando waived him in August.

Christie missed the final 24 games of last season after having bone spurs removed from the ankle. He averaged only 6.6 points in 52 games with Sacramento and Orlando -- his lowest scoring average since being a reserve for the New York Knicks in 1995-96.

He's averaged 11.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.6 assists in parts of 14 NBA seasons.
