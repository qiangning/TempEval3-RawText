Police are searching for two senior managers of the Xinpo Coal Mine after they fled following Wednesday's fatal gas explosion in Central China's Hunan Province, local government official said Friday.

Li Quanfa and Li Quansheng, head and vice head of the coal mine respectively, are accused of neglecting work safety supervision, said Li Ming, vice mayor of Leiyang City, where the mine is located.

More than 40 rescuers are searching for five missing miners, who likely did not survive the explosion, said Li.

Another five injured were in a stable condition, according to the vice mayor.

The gas explosion, which killed four miners, took place at around 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday in the Xinpo Coal Mine, where 17 miners were working underground. Eight of them were rescued while the nine others were trapped.

Rescuers have retrieved the bodies of four of the miners.

Most of the victims were villagers from the town of Simenzhou, where the mine is situated and families of the four dead have each been compensated 220,000 yuan (25,425 U.S. dollars), said Li.

The cause of the accident remains unclear. The privately-owned coal mine produced 30,000 tons of coal annually.
