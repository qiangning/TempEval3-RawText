Suspected insurgents gunned down a policeman in Thai violence-plagued province of Yala today, while demonstrators were calling for the cessation of violence in nearby Songkhla.

Sgt. Sophon Maichan, 55, was shot three times in the chest while riding his motorcycle to work in the Yala municipality. Seriously wounded, he nonetheless returned fire, but apparently missed his assailants, according to the official Thai News Agency.

Police investigators said that two men dressed as university students followed and opened fire on the police officer. Sgt. Sophon returned fire, but missed. The gunmen escaped and the police officer was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police believe the attackers were insurgents wishing to extend the atmosphere of fear by shooting government officials, said the report.

Meanwhile, about 500 demonstrators gathered at Songkha's city hall to submit a petition to the governor, denouncing the murder of a former militant and his family in Narathiwat on Wednesday.

People in Songkhla condemned the family massacre as being " inhumane and barbaric", according to the statement, which said " the persons who did the attack could not be true believers in any religion, or they would not have committed the killings. They killed even children, women, and the innocent."

The statement called for persons from all walks of life to join forces to quell the violence and create peace in the three southernmost provinces.

The petitioners said they hoped the brutal killings would never be done again. Friday's gathering in Songkhla follows a mass protest at Yala municipality's youth center Thursday.

About 10,000 people in Yala had protested against the killers who systematically gunned down former militant Sudeng Awaebusa and eight members of his household, including a baby.

The demonstrators included the community grouping Network of People, women's groups, government officials, traders, students, and member of the general public.

Placards condemning the insurgent attack were displayed at the site. One said Yala residents opposed the insurgency, while pamphlets denouncing violence by insurgents were also distributed.
