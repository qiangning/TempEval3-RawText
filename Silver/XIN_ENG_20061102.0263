French President Jacques Chirac met with his Iraqi counterpart Jalal Talabani Thursday afternoon in the Presidential palace l'Elysee.

Accompanied by four ministers, Talabani arrived in Paris Wednesday afternoon for a three-day official visit. It is the second visit of an Iraqi president to France since 2003.

In a speech in the French Institute of International Relations earlier the day, Talabani expressed his wishes to build up a new momentum in France-Iraq relations.

During the meeting, Chirac and Talabani are to discuss the situation in Iraq, the French Presidential office said.
