Switzerland's central bank said Thursday it was raising its key interest rate for the first time since June 2004 by 0.25 percentage points in response to the accelerating growth of the Swiss economy.

The three-month Libor rate would be allowed to vary in a range from 0.50 percent to 1.50 percent, instead of 0.25 percent to 1.25 percent, the Swiss National Bank said in a statement.

The SNB also raised forecasts for Swiss economic growth less than two months since an earlier official revision, predicting 1.5-percent growth of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2005 instead of the previous estimate of 1.3 percent from the Swiss economics ministry.

Growth was expected to be "a little more than two percent" in 2006, according to the bank.

"By raising its target range, the Swiss National Bank is adjusting its monetary policy to economic developments, which are proceeding as expected," the SNB said

"This ensures that the inflation outlook remains favourable," it added.

Annual inflation was forecast to reach 1.2 percent this year, before dropping back to 0.8 percent in 2006 and rising again to 1.2 percent in 2007.

Despite the rate increase announced on Thursday, the SNB said it was maintaining an expansionary monetary policy and would continue to support the recovery.

The bank intended to keep the Libor rate in the middle of the range at about one percent "for the time being".

"If the Swiss franc were to appreciate rapidly, the National Bank would react appropriately," it added.

Swiss economic growth accelerated during the third quarter to reach 2.3 percent over the figure for the equivalent period last year, amid strong consumer spending, according to official data.

SNB chairman Jean-Pierre Roth had signalled on November 2 that a rate rize was on the cards for the end of the year, despite some concerns about the potential longer term impact of higher oil prices on economic growth.

Roth acknowledged in a speech to businessmen that the price of oil had probably made a durable shift to new higher levels but its wider inflationary impact was cushioned.

However, he insisted that interest rates were still at unsustainably low levels.

"It is clear that the generous monetary environment we created in 2001 to 2003, in the wake of the difficulties of the world economy and geopolitical tension, is not adapted to a normalised situation. That should be corrected," Roth said.

Swiss forecasters believe the recovery should continue, provided it encourages a growth in investment in capital goods and employment.

The economics ministry recently warned that the health of the neighbouring eurozone economies represented a "risk factor", because of Switzerland's reliance on its biggest trade partners in the European Union.

It warned that growth in the eurozone was still propped up mainly by exports and was vulnerable to external shocks, including a strengthening of the European currency.

The European Central Bank raised its key interest rates for the first time in five years on December 1.
