The Tibet Development Foundation in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous region has raised nearly 200 million yuan (24.7 million US dollars) and launched 640 supporting projects with no strings attached, according to sources of the foundation.

The supporting projects launched by the foundation cover many fields, like culture, education, medical care and ecological protection.

The Brightness Project, for instance, has helped 20,000 cataract sufferers regain eyesight since it was launched in 1993. The relief money provided by the project for medical care has amounted to 80 million yuan (9.9 million US dollars) so far.

Sunshine Program, another aid project launched by the foundation this June, has installed solar-energy stoves for 191 rural households. It has also offered other equipment powered by solar energy for free.

The foundation was initiated in 1987 by the tenth Panchen Lama and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Its principle is to assist the local government to further improve Tibetan residents' living standards.
