Israel voiced fears of a potential explosion of Palestinian violence ahead of next month's parliamentary election and said Wednesday it would not allowing any voting in occupied east Jerusalem.

Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz was reported to have told a meeting of his top lieutenants that Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas was losing control and that the radical Islamist movement Hamas was likely to resume its campaign of attacks, particularly from the Gaza Strip.

"The Palestinian Authority is not functioning in the Gaza Strip, there is no guiding hand," Mofaz was quoted as saying by the Yediot Aharonot daily.

"The Palestinian security forces are not obeying the instructions of the PA chairman (Abbas). We have to be prepared for Hamas's return to terror activity."

Hamas, which is participating in the elections for the first time on January 25, is currently observing a moratorium on its campaign of attacks against Israel but that is due to expire at the end of the year.

Khaled Meshaal, Hamas's Damascus-based overall leader, said earlier this month that the truce would not be renewed as "our people are surrounded and are preparing for a new round of conflict."

Yuval Diskin, the head of Israel's Shin Beth internal security service, told the meeting with Mofaz that the weakening of Abbas's Fatah movement would diminish the Palestinian security services' ability to prevent attacks.

"As soon as Fatah is very weak, and it is weak, the security services that are controlled by the old guard have no legitimacy or motivation to act to prevent terrorism, and without internal legitimacy there is no chance that this will happen," he was quoted as saying by Yediot.

Fatah has been riven by divisions to such an extent that faction rebels have submitted a rival list of candidates to the official slate which will compete against each other in voting on January 25.

Hamas has been trailing Fatah in the polls but managed to win control of three major West Bank municipalities in local elections last week, in areas which had traditionally been Fatah strongholds.

Israel has strongly objected to Hamas taking part in what is only the second ever parliamentary polls, arguing that the 1993 Oslo autonomy accords bar anyone who advocates violence to stand in Palestinian Authority elections.

Hamas has been behind the majority of anti-Israeli attacks over the course of the five-year uprising and does not recognise Israel's right to exist.

The movement's participation in the elections was one of the reasons cited by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office for not allowing Palestinians living in occupied east Jerusalem from participating in January's election.

"We will not allow there to be any polling booths in Jerusalem for the Palestinian elections," an official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

"In the past, we have allowed Palestinians to vote in post offices but not this time."

Israel captured and then annexed east Jerusalem after the 1967 war but the international community still regards the area, home to nearly 200,000 Palestinians, as occupied territory.

"We will not tolerate any political activity and we are also determined to prevent any attack against our sovereignty over our capital Jerusalem, especially as Hamas is taking part in the election," said the official.

The chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat condemned the decision, calling it part of an Israeli design to sabotage the whole election.

"This is clear evidence that they are trying to destroy the election in general so they can say they have no Palestinian partner" in the peace process, said Erakat.
