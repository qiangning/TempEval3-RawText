The annual conference of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) held here Monday and Tuesday warned of the fragility of economic reforms in some parts of the former Communist bloc, pointing to events in Albania and Bulgaria.

But the more advanced countries of the region, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, which have sped away from the others on the road towards capitalism, complained that the bank was giving them the cold shoulder as it swung eastwards.

EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere said that the chaotic events in Albania -- where the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in January sparked near civil war -- were "a tragic illustration of how hard-won progress in transition can be lost with frightening speed."

Denouncing the situation there as a "disaster," de Larosiere warned that serious obstacles to a market economy remained in many countries, referring in particular to the ex-Soviet republics such as Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.

The EBRD president criticized the uncertain legal and taxation systems in the region, and the problem of corruption, crime and bureaucratic meddling in the private sector.

"The conduct of good business requires a level playing field, and the rules of the game must be universally known, transparent and fairly applied," de Larosiere said.

He said this unstable business environment was discouraging long-term foreign investment and prompting massive capital flight of billions of dollars a year.

In the background of the meeting, though, a dispute simmered over the downgrading in the bank's role in the top-performers of eastern and central Europe.

The EBRD was set up in 1991 to assist the transition to a market economy in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union.

The Czech Republic, which has been one of swiftest in the region to implement free-market reforms, complained bitterly about the EBRD's lack of activity in the country during 1996.

"Unfortunately, we were rather disappointed with the bank's achievements last year... not a single new project was signed in my country in 1996," said the governor of the Czech central bank, Josef Tosovsky.

Hungary also joined her voice to the protests. The Hungarian Secretary of State for Finance, Tibor Draskovics, said that his country "expects further support from the EBRD during this challenging phase," as Budapest prepares for membership of the European Union around the year 2000.

According to EBRD figures, new projects approved for Hungary plunged from 406 million ECUs (485 million dollars) in 1995 to 133 million ECUs in 1996. The Czech Republic's financing dropped by half, and Slovenia's allocation fell almost as much.

The EU and some European countries made it clear they supported a continued strong role for the EBRD in these richer eastern European countries, as they prepare for EU membership around the turn of the century.

The EU's commissioner for economic affairs, Yves-Thibault De Silguy, said the EBRD could still fill serious financing gaps in infrastructure and in the small and medium-sized business sector.

But the United States, which a year ago advanced the concept of "graduation" -- the staged withdrawal of the EBRD from the most prosperous ex-Communist states, which already have access to private capital -- firmly reiterated this viewpoint.

All joined, however, in urging de Larosiere, whose term expires in September, to stay on at the helm of the bank, especially since the vice-president, American Ron Freeman, is leaving the EBRD in June.

De Larosiere, 67, who has been asked by the board of governors to serve a second four-year term, said he was "still hesitating" because of the health problems of his wife, injured in an accident a year and a half ago.
