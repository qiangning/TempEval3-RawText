Prince William, second in line to the British throne, finishes his training as an officer at Sandhurst military academy this week, and Britain is abuzz with talk about when he will finally ask to marry his pretty girlfriend Kate Middleton.

Happy news from the royal household has been rare these last few years. The last birth dates back to November 2003 when Queen Elizabeth II's youngest son Prince Edward had a daughter, Lady Louise.

And there was a marriage in 2005, that of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, but it was more about normalizing a longterm relationship that had caused scandal in the past.

Since then the media and souvenir merchants have become restless: Will 2007 be the year of Prince William and the return to glamor?

On Saturday, the Daily Mail raised the possibility of an engagement party during the Christmas holidays, when the royal family will gather in Sandringham, eastern England.

The official announcement will then come in the spring, according to the daily which said Kate was invited to dinner on December 24 in Sandringham, an uprecedented event for a royal girlfriend, as well as join William and his family for Christmas Day services.

Buckingham Palace neither confirmed nor denied the report, citing a completely private event.

At 24, William, the elder son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, has for three years been dating Kate Middleton, a pretty brunette of the same age whom he met while he was studying geography and she art history at St Andrews University in Scotland.

They shared the same apartment with other students and quickly became inseparable. Signs increasingly point to marriage, even if the couple do nothing to confirm it.

Their first public appearance together happened on the ski slopes of the Swiss resort at Klosters in April 2004. There was then the first meeting with the queen in her Scottish castle at Balmoral.

The first public kiss was in the spring this year, also at Klosters. And for several months, Kate has been taking riding lessons, a virtual requirement for anyone who might want to enter a royal household passionate about horses.

In anticipation of a hypothetical engagement, the tabloid press has given Kate little breathing room, showing her in a bikini during a vacation with William in Ibiza, shopping in London, and during a night out at a club with the prince's double.

Nothing escapes them, including the first job she landed in late November.

Kate Middleton now buys accessories for Jigsaw, a British clothing chain whose owners are friends of her parents, themselves owners of an Internet company.

And with impatience growing about their plans, some firms are taking no risks.

The Woolworth department store chain recently negotiated contracts for 20 souvenir items showing the smiling faces of the prince and his beauty: cups, china ware, and even computer mouses.

All that must be added to them is a wedding date.

Other firms have take the precaution to register Internet sites, such as willandkate.co.uk, willandkate.com, williamandkate.net.

However, neither of the two has said anything until now.

When identical rumors were making the rounds last year, Prince William clearly discouraged them. "I don't want to get married until I am at least 28 or maybe 30," William said.

For Ingrid Seward, a specialist on the British monarchy, a wedding is not particularly pressing.

"I can't see them getting married soon because William isn't settled in his life yet," Seward said.

After Sandhurst, he must continuing serving in the armed forces for around another three years.
