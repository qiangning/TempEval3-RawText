Three more suspected bird flu patients have been reported in Thailand's eastern Chacherngsao Province, all are children aged between three to 11 years old, reported the Thai News Agency Saturday.

The three patients, two girls aged 11 and three and one four- year-old boy, whose families raise chickens, were admitted to a hospital in the province's municipal area earlier this week.

They all showed bird flu-like symptoms after chickens in their families died suspiciously.

Provincial public health officials have reported the three new avian flu suspected cases to the Ministry of Public Health.
