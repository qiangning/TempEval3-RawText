Nepal's government and Maoist rebels have agreed for former Gurkha soldiers to monitor a ceasefire in the Himalayan nation until the arrival of a full United Nations team, officials said Friday.

"The meeting between the government, the UN and the Maoists on Thursday evening agreed to deploy ex-Gurkha soldiers to begin the registration and verification of arms and armies," Maoist negotiator Dinanath Sharma told AFP.

"The retired soldiers will be assisting in the arms management until the full UN monitoring mission arrives in Nepal," said Sharma.

Under a peace deal agreed last month that ended a decade of civil war, the government agreed to let the Maoists enter parliament and government in return for placing their arms and fighters in camps under UN supervision.

But UN monitors are not slated to start arriving in Nepal before next month, and will not immediately have the capacity to cover all the rebel camps.

Gurkha soldiers -- from special regiments of Nepali soldiers in the Indian and British armies -- have a long history of UN peacekeeping missions.

Sharma said that a total of 111 ex-Gurkha servicemen who have retired from the British and Indian armies in the past three years would be recruited.

Earlier this week Ian Martin, the UN chief's personal representative to the peace process, said that formation of a Gurkha interim task force would make it possible for the early start of the arms and armies verification process while UN monitoring strength was built up.

Martin said that an initial party of 35 UN monitors would arrive by mid-January 2007.
