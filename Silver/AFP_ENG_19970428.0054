About 800 employees staged a work stoppage for several hours at a Nike supplier in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City over the weekend to protest their contracts, a factory manager said on Monday.

Park Hyun Tae, general director at Korean-owned Sam Yang Company told AFP that "there was some small struggle" at the plant, but denied press reports of a massive strike involving more than 3,000 workers.

All workers had returned to work Monday, he said.

According to the Lao Dong newspaper, workers on April 25 walked off the job to protest labour conditions and accused management of behaving "arrogantly" in contract negotiations.

The officia labour newspaper also reported that when workers demanded a meeting with management, they were instead locked into a dining hall.

Park, who was reached by telephone, flatly denied the press reports, and said that labour representatives met with management in a boardroom to discuss their grievances.

Labour officials said Sam Yang was strong-arming employees into signing the contracts, according to Lao Dong. Sam Yang does not have unions, and each worker signs an individual contract.

Park acknowledged that management was negotiating new labour contracts with workers, but denied heavy handed methods.

"Nobody here makes less than the 45 dollar a month minimum, and we proposed an 8.6 percent wage increase after one year," he said.

Nike officials could not be reached for comment.

The incident at Sam Yang is the latest headache for Nike, whose suppliers in Vietnam have been embroiled in a number of labour problems.

In April 1996 Sam Yang hit the news when a Korean supervisor slapped 15 Vietnamese workers on the side of the head with a shoe upper as punishment for poor quality.

In order to make sure its suppliers toe the line, Nike appointed a dedicated labour practices manager in Vietnam to help oversee the roughly 35,000 workers turning out products made exclusively for Nike.

But problems have continued. In March a Taiwanese supervisor at Nike supplier Pou Chen Shoe Factory was suspended after forcing 56 women to run around the factory floor.

Earlier this month Nike's director of communications for the Asia Pacific Region Martha Benson flew into Vietnam from Hong Kong just days after a New York-based Labour activist group highlighted low pay and instances of corporal punishment at two of Nike's subcontracters in Southern Vietnam.

"We have had production managers who are Nike employees working in the factories (in Vietnam) since day one. But we recognise the need to increase the level of oversight, especially in working conditions and labour practices" Benson told AFP by telephone from Ho Chi Minh City at the time.   fb/djw
