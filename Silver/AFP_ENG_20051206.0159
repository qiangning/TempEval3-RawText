Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes has announced her retirement from athletics and will not now bow out at next year's Commonwealth Games in Melbourne as planned.

The 35-year-old former army sergeant said Tuesday she had been badly affected by the death of a man she met while visiting her physiotherapist in Ireland.

And she admitted she lacked the motivation to continue in the sport after winning gold in the 800 metres and 1,500m in Athens last year.

Holmes' double gold in Athens was the highlight of a career peppered with injury and disappointment.

She had battled an Achilles tendon injury to make the team for Melbourne.
