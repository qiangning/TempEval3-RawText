Singapore Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lee Boon Yang said here on Tuesday that enhancing the creative capabilities is important for Singapore which is reinventing its economy to cater for the changing international economic landscape.

"Apart from its high growth potential and direct economic contribution in the form of GDP (gross domestic product) growth and jobs, the creative industries harness cultural creativity to differentiate products and services across the entire economy," Lee said at the Global Summit for Creative Industries.

He added that growing the creative industries, which include the arts, design and media sectors in Singapore, will also enhance the city state's image and its attractiveness to talent and enterprises, as well as broadening the definitions of success in the society.

Having invested more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about 588 million US dollars) on cultural hardware and software in recent years, according to the minister, Singapore will continue to develop its creative human resource, anchor more international creative enterprises and organizations, and forge strong industry engagement and ownership.

Citing the numerous opportunities for trade and collaboration lying in the rise of China's and India's economies and the continued growth throughout Asia, Lee said that Singapore will " reinforce the spirit of Asian cooperation" in the development of its creative economy.

The inaugural Global Summit for Creative Industries is one of a series of events which Singapore organizes under the banner of " Creative 2005 - Reinvent your Future" to promote its creative industries.
