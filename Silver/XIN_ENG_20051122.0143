United States President George W. Bush has reaffirmed his one-China policy and his stance in opposition to Taiwan independence, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao here Tuesday.

At a regular press conference Liu made the above remarks in response to a question on Bush's just-concluded visit to China.

President Bush enunciated his support to the one-China position when talking on the Taiwan issue with Chinese leaders, Liu said, and Bush also voiced his opposition to any unilateral actions aimed to change the status-quo across Taiwan strait, the spokesman said.
