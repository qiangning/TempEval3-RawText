Singapore has doubled the avian flu tests on local and migratory birds from once every two weeks to once a week, Channel NewsAsia reported on Thursday.

The measure is to monitor possible bird flu virus among some 20, 000 migratory birds flying into the city state during the winter months and to prevent local birds and poultry raised on farms from getting infected.

A collaboration between the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) and the National Parks Board (NParks) which started two years ago, such tests have been applied to over 400 randomly- captured birds.

All the samples collected were negative for the virus, the report said.

The AVA was quoted as saying that local farms have been asked to take biological security measures against the bird flu virus and the weekly tests will continue as long as countries in the region are affected by the disease.
