A grenade lobbed from a moving car at a police post injured two police officers in the Pacific resort city of Acapulco, Mexico, on Sunday.

The attack took place at a police barricade outside Tres Vidas, where conflict between a private hotel and farming interest has sparked a series of conflict.

Farmers who originally lived in the area claimed that they never agreed to sell their territory. Groups of peasants stormed the area in and around Tres Vidas in recent days, seizing land they claim was stolen from them.

The Tres Vidas police post is located in the city's Diamante beach section, a district popular with well-heeled tourists.

Acapulco was hit by a string of violence this year and grenade as well as shooting attacks have killed at least eight officials and injured six others.
