Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson has claimed that he will be beefing up his squad in January as Premiership is becoming a "numbers game".

Ferguson wants United to build on the 1-0 win against Chelsea at Old Trafford which revived their title ambitions.

He said: "What I will be looking to do is increase the squad in January. It's actually numbers we're lacking.

"But you have to dismiss the possibility of getting players from clubs who think they can win the Champions League."

Ferguson added: "That narrows down your options but we're playing the numbers game right now.

"I'm happy with the quality we have but we're relying too much on our younger players at a time when we're missing the experience of Roy Keane, Gary Neville and Gabriel Heinze."

United have been linked with Real Madrid's Thomas Gravesen and Bayern Munich's Michael Ballack, but both clubs are still contesting the Champions League.

In a previous January transfer window Ferguson signed Louis Saha from Fulham, because he needed to avoid players who were still involved in the Champions League.

It could be that he will now look to complete a similar deal for a player already operating in the Premiership, but not involved in Europe.
