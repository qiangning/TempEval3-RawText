Chinese Vice Premier Hui Liangyu on Monday met with visiting French Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries Dominique Bussereau and hailed the agricultural cooperation between the two countries.

The agricultural sectors of China and France complement each other and boast huge potential for cooperation, Hui said.

It is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples to step up China-France agricultural cooperation, Hui said.

Hui said that he hoped the Chinese and French agricultural sectors would build closer links.
