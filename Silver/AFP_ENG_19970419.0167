Results for last week's UN-organised elections in Eastern Slavonia, the last Serb-held part of Croatia, are due to be announced later on Saturday a UN spokesman said.

Spokesman Yuri Chizik told AFP that the results of the local, regional and upper house elections would be announced during the day.

According to Croatian radio, the results will be announced simultaneously in the UN headquarters in Vukovar, the main town in Eastern Slavonia, and in Zagreb.

Polling in the elections began Sunday but in the face of problems with delayed ballot papers and incomplete electoral lists, the UN administration extended the vote until Monday, and in one polling station until Tuesday.

They also relaxed voting rules to allow people not on the electoral lists to vote provided they had a Croatian identity card.

The UN said that it was confident that, after the initial problems, everyone who wanted to vote was able to do so.

Eastern Slavonia was captured by rebel Serbs during bitter fighting in 1991. Under a 1995 peace plan, it is due to return to Croatian control by January next year at the latest, and the elections were a key step in that process.

The announcement of the results was delayed by the need to collect ballots cast by tens of thousands of Croats force out of the region by the Serbs in 1991 -- in the process known as "ethnic cleansing" -- and now living in other parts of the country.

Once the area has returned to Croatian control they will be entitled to return to their original homes.

UN administrator Jacques Klein is expected to meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman later Saturday to discuss the elections, the post- election period and what happens when the current UN mandate ends, Chizik said.

Currently, the mandate for the UN administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) is due to end on July 15 after one and a half years.

However, the UN Security Council has said that a further UN presence, as yet undefined, will remain in the region until January.
