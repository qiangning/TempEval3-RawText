Singapore women will benefit from the new guidelines on public toilet unveiled by the National Environment Agency, Channel NewsAsia said on Saturday night.

Under the new guidelines, there will be five toilet cubicles for women in medium-sized establishments such as bars, equaling the total number of urinals and cubicles for men.

Women will have more toilet cubicles than men do in such places as convention halls and cinemas where a large number of people tend to use toilets concurrently in certain periods of time.

The new guidelines, as part of Singapore's celebration of the World Toilet Day on Saturday, are expected to change the situation of insufficient female toilets in some facilities in the city state.

In late August this year, Singapore announced the set up of the world's first Toilet College, which plans to offer courses like ecological sanitation, restroom maintenance, as well as toilet design and architecture.
