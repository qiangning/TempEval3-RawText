American figure skating star Michelle Kwan said here Saturday she is improving from a hip injury and is confident she can be at full strength for next month's US Olympic trials.

Nine-time US champion Kwan, here to compete in a fan-judged event lacking the pressure of the Grand Prix season she has missed, was forced to withdraw from several events and missed two weeks of training.

"I'm not at 100 percent but I'm getting better," Kwan said. "It will be nice to see where I'm at, even if it's not the best."

Kwan said it would be a "good month" before she is back at full strength, cutting it close to be prepared for the qualifying meet for February's Torino Winter Olympics, the first obstacle in her long quest for Olympic gold.

That US skating showdown is January 9-14 at St. Louis, Missouri. It would be only the second event in which she has competed in an event with the new judging system adopted by the International Skating Union.

"This (injury) just brings up another challenge and the new system is a big enough challenge," she said. "I would rather have that as my main focus."

Kwan, 25, settled for a silver medal at the 1998 Nagano Games and fell to bronze at the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002.
