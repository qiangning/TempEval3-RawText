Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Monday that his country wants to have 100,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium, the Iranian Student's News Agency (ISNA) reported.

"We intend to have 100,000 centrifuges and, God willing, Iran will be able to meet its needs in nuclear fuel by next year," Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying.

The current Iranian year ends on March 20, 2006.

The Iranian president had said last week that Iran intended to launch 60,000 centrifuges in its nuclear program.
