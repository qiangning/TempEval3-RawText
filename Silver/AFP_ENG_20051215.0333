Polls closed on Thursday in Iraq's historic general election for the first full-term government since the fall of Saddam Hussein, the electoral commission said.

Electoral official Hussein al-Hindawi told AFP people still waiting at polling stations would be allowed to cast their ballots until the last man, even after the doors shut at 5:00 pm (1400 GMT).

Iraqis flooded polling stations during the 10-hour election for a 275-member parliament set to put in place a government that will return the country to full sovereignty following the 2003 US-led invasion.
