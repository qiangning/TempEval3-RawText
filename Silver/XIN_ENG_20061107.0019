China and Burundi have deep traditional friendship, and should enhance cooperation in investment, infrastructure, telecommunications and agriculture, said Chinese President Hu Jintao here Tuesday when meeting with Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza, who is in China for the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held on Nov. 4-5.

In recent years, the two countries boosted their exchanges and cooperation in fields of politics, judicature, economy, trade, culture and international affairs, said Hu, suggesting the two sides continue exchanges in all fields and at all levels.

China will continue to support the peace process in Burundi, and urges the international society to enhance attention and assistance to the reconstruction in Burundi, he said.

Nkurunziza appreciates China's long-time assistance to Burundi in areas of education, public health, agriculture, power and infrastructure, saying the political and security situation is basically stable in Burundi.

The Burundian government is making efforts for national reconciliation and economic, social development, he said. Burundi is expecting further assistance from China, and wishes to enhance cooperation with China, he said.

Nkurunziza arrived in China last Friday. He and other 47 leaders and representatives of African countries attended the two- day Beijing summit, which is believed to be the largest diplomatic event between China and Africa since 1949.
