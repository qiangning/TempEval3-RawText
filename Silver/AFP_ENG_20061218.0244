Iraqi Red Crescent aid workers suspended work in war-torn Baghdad on Monday after two dozen of their colleagues fell victim to the latest mass kidnap to shock a city plagued by sectarian violence.

At least 14 Iraqis were killed in a string of bombings and shootings as new US Defence Secretary Robert Gates prepared to take office in Washington amid deepening US divisions about how to handle the crisis in Iraq.

A former Iraqi cabinet minister, an Iraqi-US dual national who was jailed for corruption, staged an escape from jail in Baghdad's highly fortified Green Zone, in a further sign of the rampant chaos engulfing the country.

"We have frozen or stopped temporarily activities in Baghdad, but this is not affecting civilian needs. This was logical because our main staff is still kidnapped," the Iraqi Red Crescent's secretary general Mazen Abdallah said.

"We are the only organisation working in all of Iraq. We don't want to stop," he added, emphasising that the closure applied only to the capital.

In addition to the main branch targeted in the kidnapping, the Iraqi Red Crescent has closed another 40 subsidiary offices in Baghdad, affecting more than 600 staff, a large proportion of them security guards, Abdallah said.

Seventeen of more than 30 men snatched in Sunday's brazen raid by gunmen dressed in police uniforms have been released, including three guards from the nearby Dutch embassy and 10 Red Crescent guards and drivers, Abdallah added.

But 19 Red Crescent staff -- a mixed group of Shiite and Sunni disaster, relief and health workers -- are still missing following what was the second mass abduction to terrorise Baghdad in less than a week.

The International Committee of the Red Cross, part of the same movement, has called for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages, and condemned the kidnapping as a breach of international humanitarian law.

Fully aware of the ugly sectarian tensions threatening to rip Iraq apart, Abdallah said he ordered his staff not to reveal their family names while at work, in order not to disclose their religious or ethnic background.

With US experts and politicians increasingly anxious over how to manage the chaos in Iraq, where around 129,000 US troops are fighting insurgents and training local forces, a new defence secretary was to take office.

Gates, a former Central Intelligence Agency director, was to be sworn in at the Pentagon just three days after his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld, blamed for the current mess in Iraq, was given a full honours send-off.

His arrival precedes the announcement of a new policy on Iraq set to be unveiled by US President George W. Bush early next year -- a new strategy that Gates is likely to be involved in shaping.

Options under consideration reportedly include boosting the number of US soldiers by between 20,000 and 50,000 to secure Baghdad, forging an alliance between moderate Iraqi Shiites and Sunnis at the expense of radicals on both sides, or even throwing the US lot in with the majority Shiites.

Bush has effectively dismissed a report by the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel of foreign policy luminaries, which recommended wrapping up US combat operations in the country by early 2008.

Meanwhile, the violence continues unchecked.

In Baghdad, five people were killed and 19 wounded Monday when a car bomb exploded in a bustling marketplace in the mixed Shiite-Sunni neighbourhood of Saidiyah, a security source said.

Three other people were killed in separate attacks and Iraq's disgraced former electricity minister Ayham al-Samarrai escaped from a jail under joint Iraqi-US guard in Baghdad, two months after he was jailed for corruption.

Five more civilians were killed in the Baquba area, north of Baghdad, with one attack targeting mourners accompanying bodies to the Shiite south of the capital for burial, police and medical sources said.

In the northern city of Mosul, unidentified gunmen ambushed and shot dead Khayreddin al-Dabbagh, a member of the municipal council, police said.

The US military also announced that two more troops were killed in action, bringing the number of US fatalities in Iraq since the 2003 invasion to 2,946, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
