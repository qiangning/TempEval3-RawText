Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir left Libya by air Sunday in defiance of UN sanctions against Tripoli, after holding talks with Libyan leader Moammer Kadhafi and government officials from Uganda, Libyan television said in a report monitored here.

The television showed Al-Bashir boarding a plane at the airport in the coastal town of Sirte. Under UN sanctions, flights in and out of Libya are prohibited.

Before leaving, Al-Bashir issued a statement, saying he and Kadhafi had discussed how Arabs should overcome their differences and resist attempts to weaken their unity.

"He stressed, furthermore, that the Arab nation, given its resources and potential, was a superpower which could, once united, impose its will and face up to its enemy," the television said in the report monitored by the BBC.

General Al-Bashir also met members of a Ugandan delegation led by Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya to discuss a dispute in which each country has accused the other of providing support for rebels operating in the border region.
