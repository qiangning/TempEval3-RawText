Egyptian security services have been holding 10 suspected French Islamists for the past 10 days, security sources said Friday.

Eight were picked up in Medinet Nasr, a northeastern suburb of the capital, and the other two in the second city of Alexandria, French diplomatic sources confirmed.

There was no immediate word on the basis of the suspects' arrest beyond their alleged involvement in militant Islam.
