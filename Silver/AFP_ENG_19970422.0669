All hostage-takers were killed as security forces ended the 18-week- old hostage drama at the Japanese ambassador's residence Tuesday, a police source told AFP.

About 20 members of the Marxist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), most of them younger than 20, had been holding the residence and 72 prominent hostages since December 17.
