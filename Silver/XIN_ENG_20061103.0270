The Chinese government has announced plans for 18 patented technology exhibition and trade centers, to promote patent application and implementation.

The centers will be set up in cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan and Chongqing. They will conduct exhibitions, trade and promotions of patented technology, daily patent management and carry out training in patent brokerage, and intellectual property protection.

"The centers will form a trade platform for amateur inventors, medium-sized and small enterprises and investors," said Zhang Qin, deputy director of the State Intellectual Property Office, on Friday.

The slow development of a patented technology market and lack of trustworthy agencies led to difficulties in the application and implementation of patents in China, said Zhang.

The non-profit centers were backed by the government and would help protect inventors, said Zhang.

Last year, the country handled more than 470,000 patent applications.

The 18 centers open for trade from Monday to Friday.

By 2010, the State Intellectual Property Office will build another 80 to 100 regional patented technology exhibition and trade centers in key cities.
