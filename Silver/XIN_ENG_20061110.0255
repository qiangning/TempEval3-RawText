Shanghai recorded 7.48 billion U.S. dollars in trade with Africa in the first 10 months of this year, a growth of 35.1 percent from the same period last year, local customs sources said.

The total included 1.33 billion U.S. dollars in exports, up 19.8 percent, and 6.15 billion U.S. dollars, up 38.9 percent.

From January to October, Shanghai's external trade amounted to 350.27 billion U.S. dollars, up 22.4 percent over the same period of last year.

Over the 10 months, Shanghai's imports of primary products declined due largely to price hikes for raw materials on international markets.

The city imported 2.94 million tons of plastic in primary form, down 2.3 percent from a year earlier, 2.44 million tons of rolled steel, down 22.3 percent, and 485,000 tons of unprocessed copper and copper products, down 43.6 percent.

According to the local customs sources, foreign-funded businesses made up 223.83 billion U.S. dollars, or 63.9 percent, of Shanghai's total foreign trade.
