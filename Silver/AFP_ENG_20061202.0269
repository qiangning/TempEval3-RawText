Arsene Wenger paid tribute to his side's character after Arsenal bounced back from two defeats to beat local rivals Tottenham 3-0 on Saturday despite the absence of injured skipper Thierry Henry.

"We played with spirit, character, determination and good organisation against a good Tottenham team," Wenger said.

Arsenal had lost successive Premiership matches to Bolton and Fulham and Wenger admitted: "We were under a lot of mental pressure but the team responded well.

"They are inspired by their ambition and they were disappointed by our last two results. We realised that, as a team, we have to give more."

Despite his satisfaction with the performance, Wenger admitted that Arsenal had enjoyed the rub of the green at the Emirates Stadium, with Steed Malbranque missing an early chance to put Tottenham ahead and two of the three goals coming from disputed penalties.

Emmanuel Adebayaor put Arsenal ahead and stand-in captain Gilberto Silva coolly converted both spot-kicks to leave the home side as comfortable winners.

"The two penalties looked to be penalties to me but it happens that you don't get them in some games," Wenger said.

"And there was a turning point at 0-0 when Malbranque had a good chance but didn't take it and we didn't concede early on set points as we have done recently.

"But you have to work hard on your luck and that is what we did today."

Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky limped off ten minutes after the break and will miss Wednesday's trip to Porto for a Champions League encounter from which Arsenal must take a point to secure their passage to the knockout stages.

"We gave a lot physically in this match but we needed a lift and we have four days to recover before Porto."

Silva also hailed the win as a welcome tonic for the Gunners ahead of the Porto match and next Sunday's trip to Chelsea in the Premiership.

"We knew today it was all about winning the game," the Brazilian said. "But we got the result and we played our best as well, so it is very pleasing.

"Before this game we knew a victory would mean a lot for us because of the important games ahead. When you win a tough match like this, it gives you a lot of confidence. We have done the job today, now we have to continue to do the job against Porto and Chelsea."

Tottenham boss Martin Jol insisted Arsenal's controversial penalties were not to blame for the defeat and admitted his side had missed a chance to capitalise on Arsenal's recent woes.

Jol told reporters: "You can talk about the decisions and they probably did cost us goals, but I would be embarrassed to talk about them too much. We did not lose because of them.

"We saw that Thierry Henry was not playing and we knew Arsenal had lost recent games. We sensed this was an opportunity, so we are disappointed."
