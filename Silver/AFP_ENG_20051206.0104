Sri Lanka's new army chief took command Tuesday with a call for talks with Tamil Tiger rebels to defuse tension in the northern town of Jaffna after 14 soldiers were killed in two blasts.

Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka said he wanted to re-establish communication links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to prevent attacks against government forces.

Fonseka's maiden press conference after assuming command of the country's 120,000-strong army was delayed for nearly half an hour after suspected Tiger rebels blew up an army tractor, killing seven security personnel.

He played down Tuesday's blast, the second since Sunday when another seven soldiers perished in an identical attack, and sounded a conciliatory line in sharp contrast to his military reputation as a hawk.

"There has been a communication gap between us and the LTTE," Fonseka said. "The LTTE has said they did not carry out the attacks. We don't have 100 percent evidence, but we think they did it.

"If they did not do it, who else could have done it. And we need to stop them."

"It is important to establish contact with the LTTE to ensure that the peace process will not collapse," he said, adding that the Tigers and the government had not maintained direct contact at field level for several months.

Sri Lanka's peace broker Norway has tried but failed to arrange a top-level meeting between the two sides to strengthen the February 2002 truce.

Fonseka said he did not believe that the escalation of violence in the island's former rebel stronghold of Jaffna would lead to fresh hostilities.

"I don't think this is a build-up to a war. Even if the attacks are indeed by the LTTE we know it is by a small group and we can deal with it," he said.
