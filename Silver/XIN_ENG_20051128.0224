A privately-owned small plane on Monday crashed in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna shortly after take-off, killing two people on board, officials told Xinhua.

"The incident happened at about 10:30 (0930 GMT) in the morning in Kaduna airport soon after the aircraft took off. Two people on board, the pilot and a lady, were killed," said Sam Adurogboye, spokesman for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.

The crash cause of the Abuja-bound plane is still not clear, Adurogboye said.

He said the plane had been in operation for more than eight years and had just returned to Nigeria on Saturday after regular maintenance in Britain.

The pilot held a US license and the plane was registered in that country but operated in Nigeria, he added.

A Boeing-737 plane crashed on the outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city on October 22 three minutes after take-off, killing all 117 on board.
