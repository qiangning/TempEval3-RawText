After several weeks of highly charged, divisive campaigns between those supporting the new constitution and those against, Kenyans will finally vote in the referendum this coming Monday.

According to the Electoral Commission of Kenya, 11.6 million registered voters are expected to turn out at 19,134 polling stations across the country.

ECK Chairman Samuel Kivuitu said polling centers across the country will open at 7 am (0400 GMT) until 5 pm (1400 GMT) during Monday's constitution referendum.

"We don't want people to vote at night. We want counting to be done during the day when voters can see," said Kivuitu.

He has however expressed concern that referendum committees have not submitted names of agents and is worried that this could open up the process to possible rigging.

"Even our officers may take sides. The dead might vote. Double voting might take place. That's why we want agents everywhere," said Kivuitu.

REFERENDUM UNDER DISPUTE

The referendum campaigns have been marked by tribalism, belligerent rhetoric, sporadic violence and the deaths of at least eight people, and is being widely viewed as a referendum on the government and a battle for power between the political elite.

President Mwai Kibaki says a new constitution is long overdue, but critics say the document perpetuates the immense powers of the president of the east African nation of 32 million people.

The document represents the first overhaul of Kenya's constitution since the current version, which was drawn up on the eve of independence from Britain in 1963.

Violence is dogging the debate, and each side is blaming the other. Protesters from both camps have taken to the streets and there have been clashes in recent months.

The government is leading the "Yes" campaign under the symbol of a banana while the opposition and a party in the ruling coalition are championing the "No" cause with their symbol of an orange.

The contest is expected to be tense and, whichever side wins, the country will bare divisions, with the process leaving a stain on a nation many hoped would take strides forward after historic 2002 elections.

In the run-up to the referendum, the Yellow Movement, a civil- society group allied to the "No" camp, challenged the proposed constitution in court.

They sought a declaration on whether the constitution-making process, including the November 21 referendum, was valid.

The constitutional court ruled on Tuesday in favor of the referendum, arguing that neither parliament nor the courts had the authority to stop the referendum because it involved the constituent power of the people to make a constitution.

The divisive campaigns have prompted church leaders to hold prayer services for a peaceful outcome with some diplomatic community in Nairobi also fear that the country might plunge into chaos after the vote.

The referendum is perceived to pitch two major ethnic communities against each other, with the Kikuyu largely behind the "Yes" vote and the Luo supporting the "No" vote.

None of the other ethnic groups are allied as solidly to a specific side, and many people now see the referendum as a popularity contest between Kibaki and his Roads Minister Raila Odinga.

TEST FOR GOVERNMENT

Analysts say the campaign could be a defining moment for Kibaki 's ruling National Rainbow Coalition (NARC).

The coalition won in 2002 on a wave of euphoria after 24 years of rule by Daniel Arap Moi, but now is in a precarious position because of growing public dissatisfaction.

Both camps agree that the existing constitution is outdated and oppressive but have failed to reach consensus on the new one, which has been the subject of debate since 1997.

A sharp rift, exposed early this year, over a new constitution seeking to curb President Kibaki's power, has now cast fresh doubts over whether the battered coalition will survive its current political crisis.

The most obvious split has been within Kibaki's shaky coalition, with at least seven ministers joining ranks with the opposition to campaign for a "No" vote, while the president and his supporters promote the "Yes" vote.

"The constitution process was supposed to bring us together but it has divided us further," says Maina Kiai, chairman of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.

Critics say Attorney General Amos Wako incorporated the amendments introduced by parliament in July which sparked three days of violent demonstrations by Kenyans outraged at the handling of the constitution writing process.

But Wako has defended the proposed constitution, saying it captures the views of wananchi (citizens) as manifested in the Bomas draft, the former draft of the new constitution.

"My role was to use Bomas draft as a benchmark and incorporate some amendments passed by parliament and that is what I did," he said on Wednesday.

Contentious issues in the draft constitution, including reduction of presidential powers and creation of an executive prime minister's post, have been the reason for the split and political infighting within the ruling coalition.

Members of the "No" camp said that the document does not reflect the wishes of the people of Kenya as manifested in the Bomas Draft.

In particular, they say, the draft has glorified the powers of the president, making him a "king".

They are also unhappy with the devolution of powers, the conditions and voter thresholds for electing a president, the powers of the prime minister and the appointment of the cabinet.

The "Yes" camp argued that the presidential powers to prorogue and dissolve parliament have been taken away and that parliament will control its calendar. The authority to allocate land has also been handed over to an independent National Lands Commission. Presidential appointments under the new constitution will be subject to parliamentary approval.

Disillusion is already running deep among the majority of Kenyans who -- fed up with rising unemployment, crime and graft -- voted successfully for the first time for change and not for their ethnic group in the 2002 polls.

Some analysts warned that Kenya could be plunged into a dangerous political crisis whatever the outcome. But the ECK boss has appealed to Kenyans to respect each other during the campaigns, noting that the differences could tear the country apart if not checked.

"We are one nation. Whichever side wins we will still remain one nation," Kivuitu said.

"We have survived many national crises which could have torn us apart. But we resisted. Let that resilience remain our hallmark. Let us leave a legacy which will be the pride to our descendants," he cautioned.
