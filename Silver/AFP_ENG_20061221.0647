The death of Turkmenistan's authoritarian leader Saparmurat Niyazov left wild speculations over his possible successor and fears that Russia might lose exclusive gas exploitation contracts, Russian media wrote Friday.

"His death launched a vicious fight for power in Turkmenistan and, what is more important, a new stage of struggles between Russia, China, the European Union and other interested parties for Turkmen gas," the Kommersant daily wrote.

Succession forecasts were hazy at best, with Niyazov -- known as Turkmenbashi, or Leader of all Turkmens, and self-proclaimed president for life -- having stamped out not only opposition but every possible rival to his authority, newspapers noted in unison.

However, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, appointed acting president Thursday, was a likely pretender, the Izvestia daily pointed out, adding that "he was considered an eminence grise in the country, and Turkmenbashi, normally quick to anger, treated him with care."

Turkmenistan's constitution bars an interim president from nominating himself for the top post, but "this norm can be overlooked if necessary."

Chief of Niyazov's presidential guard, Akmurad Redjepov, was another possible candidate, as "he enjoyed Niyazov's special trust and support," Izvestia wrote.

Niyazov's own son Murad, currently a businessman living in Austria, had neither, but "experts say Murad not only knows the political elite very well, but also made contacts with the opposition leaders," the daily said.

"As we are talking about a typical Eastern despotic system, it would be wrong to absolutely discard the possibility of family succession to the throne," the Vremya Novostei daily echoed.

However, Moscow's particular concern lay with the lucrative gas contracts granted Russia's gas giant Gazprom by Niyazov, and which could now be threatened, Russian media warned.

Russia was willing to overlook the many faults of Niyazov's regime for the sake of Turkmen gas, turning a blind eye "to the build-up of a Stalin-like regime combined with a Saddam-kind of an Eastern despotism," even up to ignoring the plight of Turkmenistan's ethnic Russians, the state Rossiyskaya Gazeta wrote.

"The reason for our diplomats' melancholic aloofness is not hard to understand -- Russia's gas interests made us tolerate both Turkmenbashi and his dictatorship. Much the same as the United States tolerated Nicaragua's dictator Somosa, who allowed the United Fruit Company a most comfortable existence," the daily wrote.

Niyazov in his turn pledged to treat Russia as a preferential partner, even while raising gas prices up to 100 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters, Kommersant recalled.

However, now the price was likely to stay the same, while "political pledges to stay loyal to Russia and not to participate in various other pipeline projects and transit to the EU are gone with Turkmenbashi," the daily warned.

Moreover, Niyazov's death could seriously destabilise the country, analysts noted.

"All this region is basically the region of collapsing states, which are very weak and unstable. Russia and other countries would have to try to fill the security vacuum so that the region would not explode and become another sore," Sergei Karaganov, chief of the foreign and defense policy council, said as quoted by Izvestia.

"A dictator's death is always a trial for his people. Sometimes a worse trial than his life had been," Rossiyskaya Gazeta quipped.
