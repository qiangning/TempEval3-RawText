Around 10,000 exhausted and hungry Rwandan refugees flowed into Biaro on Tuesday, as humanitarian organisations managed to push through 10 tonnes of aid for the first time in a week.

Other refugees, meanwhile, continued to arrive in the camp, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the south of Kisangani.

Some 30,000 people had been housed in Biaro until the beginning of last week, but the refugees, along with 55,000 others at nearby Kasese, fled after reportedly being attacked by villagers and rebel forces.

Groups of refugees have now begun emerging from the forest to head back for Biaro in search of humanitarian aid.

On Monday, a humanitarian mission found more than 5,000 refugees in the Biaro camp.

One man in a torn, filthy T-shirt and carrying a bundle on his head, described his flight.

"I heard gunfire in the middle of the night and I fled into the forest, as far away as possible. I left everything in the camp, I've got nothing left," he said.

"Then some Zairean villagers told us peace had returned, that we could go back to Biaro. We walked for two days to get here. But there are still lots of people in the forest, they are afraid to come back. You often hear firing."

Tuesday's aid shipment marked the first time since April 20 that international organisations have been able to get supplies through to the starving, exhausted and often diseased refugees, as Kabila's rebels have held back aid convoys for "security" regions.

Even on Tuesday, rebels only allowed through three trucks -- compared with the 11 requested by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- and the humanitarian organisations were held up until midday at Lula, just outside Kisangani, until a military escort could be provided.

Moreover, aid workers were only allowed to spend two hours in Biaro assisting refugees and they were prevented from travelling outside the camp, officially for security reasons.

At various points on the route linking Kisangani and Biaro, as well as in the camp, there was a strong smell of decomposing bodies.

The majority of rebels who spoke to AFP accused the mainly Tutsi rebels of massacring numerous Hutu refugees -- a charge vehemently denied by the rebels.

Witnesses said that on Tuesday they saw a group of about 15 rebel soldiers near Biaro order the weak and starving refugees to continue their trek to Ubundu, 150 kilometres (90 miles) south of Kisangani), a region to which rebels forbid access.

There was also concern over the fate of more than 500 refugees, mostly men, made by rebels, who promised food would be distributed, to board a train heading for Ubundu, which people in Biaro said they feared was "a train of death."

Earlier on Tuesday, Zairean rebels asked UN staff to prepare to fly home a first group of about 1,000 Rwandan refugees from Kisangani in eastern Zaire, the UN refugee agency said.

Antonella Gesulfo of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said in Kisangani that the rebels had told the UNHCR that the Hutu refugees were travelling to the city from Biaro by train.

"This was a surprise for us, it wasn't planned, but if it helps us speed up repatriations, why not?" Gesulfo said. The United Nations faces a monumental task if it is to find and fly home tens of thousands of exhausted and terrorised refugees within a 60-day rebel deadline starting Thursday.

The ultimatum, imposed by rebel leader Laurent Kabila on Sunday, has already been rejected as unreasonable by both the United States and United Nations.

French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette on Tuesday further denounced the ultimatum and urged that humanitarian organisations must be given immediate access to refugees.

European foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg also called on Kabila to guarantee humanitarian organisations access to conflict zones.

In Biaro, the humanitarian lorries unloaded biscuits, powdered milk, medicines, covers and cooking utensils.

Because of the limited supplies available, only children were allowed biscuits, amid disorderly scenes, with refugees, driven by hunger, jostling for food.

Some 170 unaccompanied children were among a group of refugees to be taken by the lorries which brought in the aid to a transit centre close to Kisangani, from where they were to be flown home to Rwanda on Wednesday, a UNHCR spokesman said.
