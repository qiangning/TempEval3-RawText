Some 365,000 people around China have applied to attend the national civil servant qualification exam for 10,282 posts available next year in central government departments, the Ministry of Personnel said Friday.

This means roughly 35 candidates will compete for one post in 97 departments of the central government, said a ministry official.

According to the official, the exam this year, scheduled for Saturday in 347 exam spots across the country, for the first time calls off limitations, such as household registration, gender, appearance and marriage status, so as to offer equal opportunities for examinees.

The exam fee is exempted for examinees from impoverished families.

Inspection teams sent by the central authorities will be touring the exam spot for supervision, the official said.

The result of the exam will be released at the website of the Ministry of Personnel in late December.

With severe employment pressure, civil service has become one of most popular professions in the country over recent years for its stable incomes, lofty social status and perfect welfare insurance.
