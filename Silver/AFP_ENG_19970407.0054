A retired Indian police officer has been caught feeding free food provided by the government for the rural poor to his cows, a newspaper reported Monday.

Government officials in the eastern state of Bihar made the discovery when they paid a surprise visit to the officer's village, The Statesman said.

Lakhan Lal Mishra, a voluntary activist, was quoted as saying food intended for village children and pregnant women was being sold illegally.

"We do not like this kind of misuse," one official said.
