Adel Imam, the best-known comedy actor of the Arab world, paid tribute Tuesday to the 105 Lebanese killed by Israeli shelling in Cana in south Lebanon.

Dressed in a dark suit, the normally razor-sharp Egyptian comic was at a loss for words as he prayed and placed flowers on the graves of the victims in Cana village.

"I am incapable of saying anything standing here before these tombs," he told reporters, before greeting victims' relatives who turned out to see him.

Adel Imam has been in Lebanon since April 16 to perform his latest play, Az Zaim (The Leader), a satire on Arab politics.

Lebanon marked the first anniversary on Friday of Israel's shelling of a UN compound in Cana which killed 105 civilians taking shelter there during the Jewish state's Grapes of Wrath operation against Hezbollah guerrillas.
