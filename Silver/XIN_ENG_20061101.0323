Cyprus Government Spokesman Christodoulos Pashiardis said Wednesday that proximity talks in Helsinki concerning Turkish obligations towards European Union (EU) and Cyprus has not yet be confirmed.

Pashiardis made the remarks to the press after a cabinet meeting, as Finland, the rotating EU presidency, is working on a draft proposal, providing for opening of Turkish occupied port of Famagusta under the EU administration for 24 months in combination with the opening of Turkish ports to ships carrying the Cypriot flag and the transfer of Varosha to the UN.

For the purpose, it has been focusing on preparing the ground for a possible meeting over the weekend in Helsinki between Cyprus and Turkey.

Pashiardis told the press that the return of Famagusta is the prime issue. "Without the return of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants, there is no room or possibility for the Finnish initiative to be successful."

Asked if Nicosia objects to the presence of Turkish Cypriots at the possible talks in Helsinki, Pashiardis replied that if there is finally an invitation, the presence of any Turkish Cypriot will be merely to make an impression.

"Only the Turkish army has a say and it will be present in the Helsinki negotiations with a representative of the Turkish government," said Pashiardis.

Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily intervened and occupied the north of Cyprus following a coup by a group of Greek officers.

Turkey, a country aspiring to become an EU member state, does not recognize the Republic of Cyprus and has failed so far to implement the EU-Turkey Customs Union Protocol, which provides for opening of its ports and airports to Cyprus.

The EU formally launched talks with Turkey over the country's accession last October. The negotiations are expected to last at least a decade and Ankara is required to meet a number of criteria spelled out by the EU before entry.

The Republic of Cyprus, which entered the EU on behalf of the whole island in May 2004, is able to block Turkey's entry talks with its veto.
