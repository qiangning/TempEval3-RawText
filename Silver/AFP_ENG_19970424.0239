Fears of damage to British exporters caused by the pound's large gains heightened on Thursday after Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) reported a dramatic slide in profits, which it blamed partly on sterling's strength.

The British chemicals group said that the strong pound, as well as intense competition, had caused pre-tax profits (before exceptional costs) in the first quarter of 1997 to slump almost 68 percent to 65 million pounds (105.3 million dollars), from 202 million in the same period of 1996.

Turnover in the three-month period fell five percent to 2.44 billion pounds.

ICI's chairman, Sir Ronald Hampel, said: "Sales volumes were generally strong and we achieved further productivity savings, but profits were reduced by intense price competition and the strong pound."

The rise in the value of the pound had wiped 40 million pounds off the company's profits in the first three months of 1997, ICI said, warning that this squeeze would continue into the second quarter of the year.

The disappointing news led financial analysts to downgrade their full- year profit forecasts for one of Britain's major companies, and provoked a slide of over three percent in ICI's share price, which fell 24 pence to 696.5.

Since last August, the British currency has risen 22 percent against the German mark and more than five percent against the dollar. A rise in the value of the pound makes British exports more expensive for overseas buyers.

Dealers said that London-based investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson had downgraded its full-year profit forecast for ICI to 500 million pounds, from the previous estimate of 590 million pounds.

Another major exporter, British Steel, has also suffered from the gains of the pound, particularly because much of its exports are destined to Germany.

The company, which last month said it had decided to accelerate job cuts in Britain because of sterling's sharp rise, has had its profit forecasts for the year to March 1998 slashed by over half.

Glaxo-Wellcome, the world's largest drugs company, for its part has warned that if the pound remained at its current high levels, this would have a "significant impact" on sales and profits.

On Wednesday, the main employers' organisation, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said it was "concerned" about sterling's steep rise, after releasing a survey that showed deepening pessimism among exporters.

It called for the next British government after May 1 general elections to raise taxes, rather than tighten monetary policy, which would further strengthen the pound.
