The Chicago Federal Reserve, one of 12 regional bracnhes of the US central bank, is facing congressional scrutiny over charges that its president broke rules by inviting an outside consultant to attend secret briefing sessions on interest rate policies.

Representative Henry Gonzalez said Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow violated Fed rules by inviting Northwestern University economist Martin Eichenbaum to sit in at two briefing sessions in January and February.

Aides of Gonzalez, a Democrat from Texas who is a long-time critic of the Federal Reserve Board, slammed the move as a waste of money since the Chicago Fed employs 23 economists.

Last week, the policy-making Open Market Committee, of which Moskow is a voting member, moved to hike the federal funds rate to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent, sparking a stock market sell-off.

"If someone knows what the members are going to do at the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, it is highly exploitable and extremely valuable information," an aide to Gonzalez involved in the probe was quoted as saying Thursday.

"There was no breach of confidentiality," Moskow said in a terse statement.

The Chicago Fed said Eichenbaum attended two policy briefings in January and February and was 'bound by a strict coinfidentiality agreement."

"We have since taken steps to assure than only employees with specific clearance will participate in future Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago monetary policy briefings," a Fed statement said.
