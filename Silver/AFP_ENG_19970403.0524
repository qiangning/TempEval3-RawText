A climber who fell while abseiling on Britain's highest mountain has died from his injuries, police said Thursday.

The man was climbing with a friend on Observation Gully near the summit of 4,406-foot (1,300-meter) Ben Nevis in Scotland when he fell. The second man also suffered "serious injuries."

The pair were airlifted to hospital in Fort William where the first climber died from his injuries, a police spokesman said.

Neither climber was named by police.
