Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said on Friday that he was optimistic that a coming UN nuclear watchdog meeting will yield a favorable outcome for Iran.

"If the Europeans want to make a wise decision, they have to respect Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). I think the result of this meeting will be positive and favorable for Iran," Larijani was quoted by the semi-official Mehr news agency as saying.

Larijani referred to the IAEA's Board of Governors meeting due on Thursday, during which the governors will discuss Iran's nuclear program based on a report submitted by the agency's chief Mohamed ElBaradei.

Larijani said that he assumed ElBaradei will deliver a " rational and clear report" on Iran because the IAEA was "taking positive steps" recently on the Iranian nuclear case.

However, Larijani warned that Iran will "resort to other means" if the European Union (EU) "wants to waste opportunities" by prompting a resolution against Iran at the IAEA meeting.

Iran resumed uranium conversion activities, a preparatory step for uranium enrichment, in early August, a move scuttling nuclear negotiations with the EU which started after Tehran suspended all activities related to uranium enrichment in November 2004.

In response, the IAEA in late September urged Tehran to re- suspend all enrichment-related activities in a EU-drafted resolution, saying Iran's refusal will risk a referral of its case to the UN Security Council.

Larijani in early November forwarded a letter to foreign ministers of the European trio of Britain, France and Germany, calling for resuming bilateral nuclear negotiations, but the EU insists that Iran implement the IAEA resolution before the reopening of nuclear talks.

The United States accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons secretly, a charge rejected by Tehran as politically motivated.
