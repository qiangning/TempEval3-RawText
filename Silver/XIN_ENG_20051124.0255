Canadians are one step closer to a rare winter election as the opposition Conservatives tabled a motion of non-confidence on Thursday in the parliament, setting the stage for toppling the Liberal minority government led by Prime Minister Paul Martin.

Stephen Harper, Leader of the Conservative Party, spoke widely about the sponsorship scandal and corruption of the Liberal governments in his address to the House when introducing the motion.

"The Liberal culture of entitlement goes on. The public must be given a chance to put it to an end,'' he said.

Harper said the Liberal party has had no moral authority to govern since April when testimony at the inquiry into the sponsorship program alleged kickbacks.

It would be impossible to bring down the government without the support of the New Democratic Party (NDP) which withdrew its support for the Liberals early this month, he said.

The NDP chose to back the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois following failed talks with the Liberals over health care following the initial investigation report on the sponsorship scandal confirmed former Liberal government was responsible for the scandal.

The three opposition parties hold the majority of the 308 seats in the House. If the motion passes, Prime Minister Paul Martin is widely expected to ask Governor General Michaelle Jean to dissolve Parliament on Tuesday, leading to an election on Jan. 16 or Jan. 23.

In response to Harper's motion, Liberal House Leader Tony Valeri cited eight straight balanced federal budgets, the lowest unemployment in 30 years and the lowest interest rates in a generation.

"The opposition calls it arrogance. Canadians call it achievement," Valeri said. "We will work to make the best country in the world even better."

Thursday's non-confidence motion is being tabled on the same day as the start of a two-day historic first ministers' meeting including aboriginal groups.

The Martin government are expected to announce a commitment of 4 billion Canadian dollars (about 3.2 billion US dollars) in Federal cash for aboriginal housing, education and health, at the conclusion of the summit in Kelowna, British Columbia on Friday.

On Wednesday, Alberta Premier Ralph Klein predicted Canada would be left with another minority Liberal government if the opposition forces an election in the new year.

Speaking in Halifax on Wednesday as part of a cross-Canada speaking tour, Klein said he saw no many changes in the political landscape after an expected federal election in January.

The outspoken Conservative premier said it was unlikely the federal Conservatives will gain much ground because they would not be able to win enough support in vote-rich Ontario.
