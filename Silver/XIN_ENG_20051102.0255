Aid agencies in Denmark have managed to collect 1.3 million euros to help earthquake victims in Pakistan, Ritzau news bureau reported on Wednesday.

Five major aid organizations in Denmark, including Danchurch Aid, Save the Children, Unicef, the Red Cross, and Doctors Without Borders, have joined forces to raise the funds.

The result was "impressive", according to secretary general of Danchurch Aid, Henrik Stubkjoer, who acknowledged difficulty in getting relief efforts underway.

"The catastrophe grew slowly and we had difficulty obtaining information," said Stubkjoer.

Meanwhile, members of Doctors Without Borders expressed frustration at the Foreign Ministry's decision to postpone sending a well-equipped field hospital to the region.

"Denmark should play a more active role in relief efforts. Getting as much help to the area as quickly as possible should be the priority," said Soeren Brix Christensen, chairman of the Danish division of Doctors Without Borders.

Danish-Pakistani doctors returning from the stricken areas also expressed their confusion about the decision to postpone delivery.

"The Danish hospital is equipped with x-ray equipment and suited to helping people with injuries from the earthquake. There are other field hospitals in the area, but not of the same high quality that Denmark can offer," said Khurran Jamil, a doctor who recently returned from a mission to the area.

The Foreign Ministry explained that other countries had deployed field hospitals, but that there could be an additional need for the Danish field hospital in the coming months.
