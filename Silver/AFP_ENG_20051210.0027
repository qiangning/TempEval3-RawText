China's foreign minister on Saturday tried to soothe international worries over its rising dominance in the East Asian region, assuring that Beijing will stay on a path of peaceful development.

"China, a developing country, will keep to its peaceful influence. China is insisting on a path of peaceful development," Li Zhaoxing told reporters.

"We will not be threatening or replacing anyone," he said. "We'll help as much as possible to establish a harmonious world. In that way, everyone is happy."

His remarks came on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting next week, which will be followed by the inaugural East Asia summit.

The summit in the Malaysian capital brings together the 10 members of ASEAN as well as China, Japan, South Korea, and India, Australia, New Zealand.

The inclusion of Australia, New Zealand and India was the result of concern raised by Singapore, Japan and Indonesia over possible Chinese dominance in the absence of the United States.

Li dismissed fears that China was harbouring ambitions to be dominant in the region, replacing the traditionally more powerful influence of the United States and Japan.

"We have lots of issues at home. We are focusing... on improving the living of the 1.3 billion Chinese people," Li said.

He reiterated Beijing's stance that the country needed a peaceful international environment for its development.

"We want to see peace across the world so we can focus our energy on developing our economy," he said. "Second, we want to make friends. Only through making friends, our reforms may be able to progress smoothly."

Washington, though unsure about the value of the forum that does not have set objectives, is concerned over its direction in the region as China's influence grows, US diplomats in Asia and officials in Washington have said.

The United States has also been concerned over China's rising military might and economic clout in Asia, where Washington is linked by defense alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand.

But analysts say some unpopular policies of the United States and Japan are also a reason why their influence in the region has diminished.
