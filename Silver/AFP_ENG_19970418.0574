Pope John Paul II on Friday appointed two Chinese scientists -- one from Taiwan, the other from the mainland -- to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

The two are Chin Ningyang, 74, from Hefei in China, the 1957 Nobel Physics Prize winner and son of a mathematics professor at Beijing university.

Chin emigrated to the United States in 1945, but resumed contacts with China in 1972.

Since 1986 he has taught both in the United States and in Hong Kong. He is also a member of China's Academy of Sciences.

Te-Tzu Chang, 70, graduated in the United States and is well-known among scientists for his genetical research which revolutionized rice production in Third World countries.

He was born in Shanghai but lives in Taiwan.
