South African President Thabo Mbeki has personally telephoned Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to congratulate on her election as the first woman president of Liberia as well as of Africa.

Mbeki said the election process in Liberia, in spite of a hard- fought and even bitter contest, had shown the world that democracy and free elections were becoming the norm on the continent, according to a statement issued by South Africa's Foreign Ministry on Thursday.

He appealed to all concerned to accept the confirmed outcome of the election, to concentrate on national unity and development, and to pursue any remaining disputes through the available machinery set up for the purpose.

Mbeki also expressed the hope that Liberia would achieve stability after a bitter and debilitating civil war, the ministry said.

"The government and people of South Africa join Liberians and the international community in celebrating your election as the first democratically elected woman head of state in Africa," he told Johnson Sirleaf.

"Your election is indeed a victory not only for Liberian women in particular, but also represents a beacon of hope for women in Africa and the world in general. It most eloquently makes the unequivocal statement that, indeed, a new dawn has arrived for African women," he said.

Liberia, a country with a unique and compelling history, could be assured of the continued support of the government and people of South Africa in its government-led efforts to pursue a sustainable reconstruction and development program and to play a positive role in the New Partnership for Africa's Development, not only in its own region but in Africa generally, he said.
