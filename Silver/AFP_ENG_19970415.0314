The ailing founder of South Korea's failed Hanbo Group was moved from his jail to hospital after a reported stroke Tuesday as prosecutors investigated a loans-for-kickbacks scandal surrounding the conglomerate, officials said.

Hanbo founder Chung Tae-Soo was taken to hospital following a deterioration in his health, prison authorities said.

"The jailed Hanbo chief was sent out for a medical check at a private hospital," a spokesman for the Seoul Detention Center told AFP.

Chung, who suffers from diabetes, has had high blood pressure since he was jailed on January 31 on charges of embezzlement, tax evasion and bribery, he said.

The jailed tycoon suffered a stroke and paralysis, the South's Yonhap News Agency reported.

Hanbo, the country's 14th largest conglomerate, collapsed in January under 5.8 billion dollars of debt, leading to allegations that it obtained loans without sufficient collateral in return for kickbacks.

The 73-year-old was one of 11 figures jailed, including four lawmakers and one former cabinet minister, for their alleged involvement in the massive loans-for-kickbacks scandal.

"Chung's condition has worsened since he faced a gruelling parliamentary hearing from his jail on April 7," the spokesman said, giving no further details.

Press reports Tuesday said South Korea's parliamentary speaker was resisting prosecutors' demands he be questioned on allegations he also received money from Hanbo.

Speaker Kim Soo-Han was asked to appear at the Prosecutor General's Office after an Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting being hosted in Seoul ends on Tuesday, Yonhap and other news reports said.

But Kim refused to respond to the summons, citing his status as head of the legislature, Kim's aide was quoted as saying.

"We have not been notified by the prosecution (of the reported summoning) but it would amount to challenging the authority of the legislature to investigate the speaker," said Ku Bon-Tae, head of the speaker's secretariat.

The speaker reportedly resented the prosecutor's move, saying: "They may drag me into a questioning room but I will never present myself at the prosecutor's office."

The prosecutors then offered to question him away from the prosecutor's office to spare the speaker the embarassment of appearing in public before cameras, Yonhap said.

It was not clear whether he would appear and Senior Prosecutor Kim Sang-Hee declined to comment on the reports.

The speaker has been accused of receiving 50 million won (56,000 dollars) from Hanbo in political funds.

The prosecution has been investigating politicians reportedly on a list of alleged beneficiaries of money from Hanbo.

The reported summoning of the speaker came after the chairman of the ruling New Korea Party, Lee Hoe-Chang, accused the prosecution of investigating politicians indiscriminately.

"It is not desirable for the prosecution to investigate (politicians) as if it were taking revenge on political circles," Lee said.

The prosecution authorities have come under attack from parliament for allegedly covering up the Hanbo loans-for-kickbacks scandal.

The prosecution had said earlier aside from the four already arrested, it had no plans to investigate other politicians who allegedly took customary "rice cake expenditures" or cash gifts with no clear strings attatched.

The prosecution's sudden toughening of policy toward politicians triggered charges of political conspiracy.
