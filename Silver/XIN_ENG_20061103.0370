The United Nations will create a logistics support base in Valencia, Spain, for peacekeeping missions, Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on Friday.

"At the new base, the United Nations will carry out logistical support activities such as electronic communication with peacekeeping missions on the ground," as well as do information technology and communications work, Zapatero told a press conference.

Spain would invest about 12 million euros (14,4 million U.S. dollars) to develop the project, which will create nearly 300 direct jobs, Zapatero said, after meeting with outgoing UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday.

Zapatero said in a briefing that he was satisfied and proud about the creation of such logistics center which, he said, will have enormous consequences for the area around Valencia, and which shows his government's full commitment to the UN and to world peace.

The decision to create the support base for peace missions must be approved in the next few weeks by the UN General Assembly.

The Spanish prime minister was among the leaders attending the 16th Ibero-American Summit, which opened on Friday in Uruguay, a gathering of Spain, Portugal and their former colonies across the Americas.
