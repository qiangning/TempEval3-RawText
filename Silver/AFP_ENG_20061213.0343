India won the Asian Games women's field hockey bronze medal with a 1-0 win over South Korea at the Al-Rayyan stadium here on Wednesday.

Mamta Kharb scored the winner in the 16th minute by deflecting in a penalty corner as India avenged the 3-2 defeat by the Koreans in the seven-nation preliminary league.

South Korea, beaten by China in the final in Busan four years ago, were thwarted in the second half by the Indian defence, especially goalkeeper Dipika Gongala and full-back Subhadra Pradhan.

The Indian girls made up for the disappointing display by their male counterparts who will return from the Asian Games without a medal for the first time.

India must now wait for the outcome of the China-Japan gold medal clash later on Wednesday to know if they have earned a direct entry into the 2008 Beijing Olympics along with the finalists.

According to the new qualification rules of the International Hockey Federation, India will go through if Japan wins the final.

If Olympic hosts China win, the additional spot will be given to a team from the Oceania region.

Meanwhile, Malaysia finished fifth with a 5-0 rout of Taiwan. Siti Othman scored two goals and Nurairah Khushaini, Chitra Arumugam and Nadia Rahman one each.
