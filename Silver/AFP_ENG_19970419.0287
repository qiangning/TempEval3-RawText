Mali's ruling party is leading the first round of legislative elections, officials said Saturday, but the abandonment of the second deciding round by opposition parties crying foul has cast a cloud over the whole process.

Of the 55 electorates, the Alliance for Democracy in Mali party has won 14 outright, has a favourable situation in 37 and unfavourable in three.

It did not file a candidate in the 55th electorate.

That result gives the party an initial 24 seats in the 147-seat future national assembly as a result of the first-round polling which took place on April 13. The second -- and far more controversial -- round will take place on April 27.

A total of 34 parties out of 62 officially registered in Mali are taking part, but only three can claim to have a national audience.

Fourteen opposition parties have withdrawn their candidates from the second round, saying they would not recognise the outcome of what they are calling a "fraudulent" election "tainted with irregularities."

Calling for a suspension of the elections, these parties have said they would also boycott the May presidential elections, leaving incumbent President Alpha Oumar Konare as the only candidate on the ballot.

However a report issued Wednesday by a team of international observers said the elections had been "secret and fair."

Thursday, Konare hinted at changes to the electoral agenda "within the framework of the constitution," admitting irregularities had occured which were "neither wanted nor desirable."

He called on Malians to "never use violence" after a clash Wednesday between protesting opposition supporters and police left 20 people injured according to an opposition party count.

"This initial failure of the first round mustn't disorient us," he said.

Voter participation stood at 32 percent, significantly higher than the 22 percent recorded at the date of the last Malian elections five years ago.

After the two rounds of legislative elections, then the presidential election, Malians will be asked to turn out once more in June for council elections -- a marathon three-month exercise for one of the poorest countries in the world, where only one percent of the population can read and write.
