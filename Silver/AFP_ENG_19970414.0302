Zairean rebels' success in taking their country's second city Lubumbashi last week, was due in part to the goodwill of neighbouring Zambia, according to residents living along the border.

In the sleepy border town of Kipushi about 30 kilometres (19 miles) southwest of Lubumbashi, the people claimed that troops of rebel leader Laurent Kabila infiltrated via Zambia on Monday and seized control of their town virtually without a fight.

"We heard three shots at around 06:00 a.m., then nothing else. The soldiers surrendered right away. The rebels were in control almost immediately," said one man who asked not to be identified.

"The first of the rebels, arrived on food and looked tired as theough they had been marching for a long time. The others seemed in better shape. There are serious grounds for believing that some arrived during the night by lorry from Zambia," he said.

According to some reports reaching Lubumbashi and which it was not possible to verify, Kabila's men have a base camp about 30 kilometres (19 miles) inside Zambian territory where "wasungu" - white men in Swahili - have been spotted recently.

Kipushi is the most straightforward access route to Lubumbashi from Zambia over a narrow but good road through the bush and which is well maintained because of the large amount of commercial traffic which uses it.

Another route to Lubumbashi which is wider but lies 100 kilometres (60 miles) away passes through Kasumbalesa.

When the rebels captured Kasenga, 200 kilometres (125 miles) northeast of Lubumbashi at the end of March, they also went through Zambia to catch the Zairean soldiers from the rear, according to informed sources.

The fall of Lubumbashi came as Zambia refused permission to Belgian troops to base soldiers at Ndola on the Zambian side of the border in readiness for an evacuation of foreign nationals from Lubumbashi.

The rebel victory also came the day after Rwandan strongman General Paul Kagame spelled out clearly that the Kabila had the support of countries of the Great Lakes region.

The rebel troops also benefitted from the active support of the local population, in Kipushi and in Lubumbashi.

In Lubumbashi, local people showed the rebels where to find the soldiers of the elite Zairean Presidential Security Division (DSP) whose men had chosen to resist the rebel advance rather than grabbing what they could and fleeing as the Zairean army had been wont to do elsewhere.

Outside the DSP headquarters south of the city, local people deliberately misled the driver of a DSP tank about where the rebels were coming in. He was caught off guard and killed by the rebels.

It was the people of Lubumbashi who recognised and handed over to the rebels, Colonel Kinene, the DSP chief as he was fleeing disguised in civilian clothes and in possession of 20,000 dollars. In this way the DSP was made to pay for the numerous abuses committed by the soldiers in the city.

Even without such help, Kabila's men would probably have captured Lubumbashi but it would have taken them much longer and exacted a much heavier toll on rebel forces.
