Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday sacked his transport minister, Anatoly Zaitsev, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting informed sources.

Yeltsin issued a decree to fire Zaitsev, who had assumed the post in August 1996. He is to be replaced by his deputy, Nikolai Aksenenko.

Zaitsev, 57, is on the board of a company that plans to build a high- speed rail link between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, a multi-billion dollar project that has drawn wide criticism the past two years.

Between 1988 and 1996, Zaitsev ran the Oktiyabrskaya railway between the two cities.

Also Monday, Yeltsin accepted the resignation, tendered on April 5, of the head of Russia's top tax authority, Vitaly Artyukhov, Interfax quoted the same sources as saying.

Artyukhov had been in his post since February 1996.

Tax collection is a serious problem in Russia, where last year only 60 percent of taxes owing were paid. So far this year only 50 percent of tax targets have been achieved.
