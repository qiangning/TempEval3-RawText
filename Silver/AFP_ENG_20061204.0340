A Santiago court Monday released Pinochet on bail from house arrest, although the ailing former leader is gravely ill in hospital after suffering a massive heart attack over the weekend.

The release order follows charges against Pinochet, 91, in connection with two murders by the "Caravan of Death," a band of soldiers who conducted extrajudicial killings in the months after the 1973 coup that brought him to power.

In 2002, the Supreme Court dropped an earlier attempt to try Pinochet on the "Caravan of Death" case, arguing that mild dementia hindered his ability to defend himself.
