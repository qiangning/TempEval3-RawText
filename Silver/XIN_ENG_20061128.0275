Uzbekistan expected to win at least 15 golds from the Doha Asian Games slated for Dec. 1-15.

Bahodir Husan Hodjaev, chef de mission of the Uzbekistan delegation, said they are confident of winning more golds this time than four years ago in Busan.

"Last time we finished fifth with 15 golds in Busan, and this time I believe we can win more golds" said Hodjaev.

"Wrestling and boxing are our medal hopeful sports. Besides them we are expected to do well in athletics, chess and Gymnastics, " added he.

Uzbekistan has a long and distinguished sporting history. Gymnast Oksana Chusovitina, now 31, is the only female gymnast in history to have competed in four Olympic Games. She finished second in the vault at the 2005 World Championships.

In athletics, javelin thrower Sergey Voynov won the 1998 Asian Games title and was third in Busan four years ago.

Uzbeckistan finished fifth on medal tally with 15 golds, 12 silvers and 24 bronzes in the Busan Asiad in 2002.
