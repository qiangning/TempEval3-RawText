Leading United Front candidates for the role of India's 12th prime minister after the fall of H.D. Deve Gowda:

G.K. MOOPANAR: Leader of the regional Tamil Manila Congress (TMC) party, one of the members of the ousted United Front government. Moopanar's party has 20 members in parliament. A former Congress (I) veteran, known for long as the trouble shooter of former premier Indira Gandhi, he split from the Congress last year and floated the TMC, whose power base is confined to the southern state of Tamil Nadu. He is known to be close to most Congress leaders as well as Sonia Gandhi, widow of assassinated former premier Rajiv Gandhi. Speaks poor English and virtually no Hindi, the national language, and is at home only in Tamil. Has never held any government post.

N. CHANDRABABU NAIDU: Chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, the country's third most populous state, and leader of the regional Telugu Desam party, floated by his late father-in-law, N.T. Rama Rao. Naidu's party has 17 members in parliament. Naidu was a key figure in the United Front coalition government's negotiations with the Congress after the Front was ousted. Naidu's party, which decimated the Congress in his home state last year, enjoys grass-root support across the coastal state. Naidu is believed to nurse high political ambitions.
