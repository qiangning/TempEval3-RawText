US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns on Sunday voiced satisfaction after Japan gave the final go-ahead to resume imports of some US beef after a two-year ban.

"I'm very pleased to announce that the Japanese market is now open to US beef products," Johanns said in a statement. "Resuming beef trade with Japan is great news for American producers and Japanese consumers, as well as an important step toward normalized trade based on scientifically sound, internationally recognized standards."

Japan barred imports of US beef in December 2003 after cases of mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), were discovered in cattle in the country.

It was a devastating blow to the US farming industry as Japan was the number one overseas market for its beef, buying 1.7 billion dollars worth in 2002. Japan had imposed a similar ban on Canadian beef in May 2003.

The row with Washington turned bitter in October 2004 when Japan promised to exempt US cows aged 20 months or younger from screening if high-risk parts were removed. Washington interpreted the agreement as a breakthrough but Tokyo said it needed more time to verify how to test the age of the cattle.

Japan now was to send inspectors to North America to ensure compliance with the Japanese safety guidelines.

Johanns said that "reopening the Japanese market to US beef has been a top priority for me since becoming Secretary... Japan's action today sets an excellent example for other countries in Asia whose markets remain closed.

"Now is the time for Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and others to open their markets to US beef. I urge all countries to take a science-based approach and adopt OIE standards for allowing beef trade from 30-month animals," Johanns added.

US farm-state senators had even pressed for sanctions worth 3.1 billion dollars unless Tokyo opened up again by the year-end.

It is still unclear, however, if the lifting of the ban will appease disgruntled US farmers and politicians, with Japan expected only to import a fraction of the beef it once took in.

The United States in 2001 banned Japanese beef imports -- mostly the niche market of luxury Kobe beef -- after Japan became the only Asian country to report mad-cow disease in a herd.

Japan exported 800,000 dollars worth of beef to the United States in 2000.
