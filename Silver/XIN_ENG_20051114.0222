The fifth Forum on China Internet Media is to open Tuesday in Hangzhou, capital city of east China's Zhejiang province, involving more than 200 officials and experts nationwide.

With the theme of 'Internet Media and Harmonious Society', the forum will include discussions on the development of China's Internet media, next-generation Internet technology and the application of Rich Media.

Officials and experts from the State Council Information Office, Ministry of Information Industry and the All-China Journalists Association, will attend the three-day forum together with the presidents of state-owned and commercial Internet media.

"The Internet media are bracing for the second surge of development. China-based Websites can only outdo their global competitors by providing high quality services," said Zhou Xisheng, president of the state-owned Xinhua Online.

Established in 2001, the annual forum is among the most authoritative and influential activities in China's Internet media industry.
