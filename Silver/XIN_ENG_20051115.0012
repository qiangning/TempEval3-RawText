Tanzania is to bring back for trial foreigners suspected of robbing banks and of committing other crimes once identified and is asking neighboring countries for assistance in repatriation.

Tanzanian Director of Criminal Investigation Adadi Rajabu was quoted by local press as saying on Tuesday that the country had spent a lot of money to find out all those involved in bank robberies by foreigners.

"We follow them (suspects) in Kenya and Uganda but in vain and now we have petitioned that they be arrested and be brought to answer charges because they committed crimes here," said the police officer.

In the past three years, Tanzania has witnessed a spate of well- executed armed robberies by foreigners on such financial institutions as the CRDB Bank in Dar es Salaam, NBC Bank branch in Moshi and in Musoma and the Madison Bureau de Change in Dar es Salaam.

Culprits allegedly enter Tanzania easily using loopholes that Tanzanians are not suspicious and trust even foreigners.

The police officer also called on bank managements to introduce modern security facilities so as to better fight robberies.
