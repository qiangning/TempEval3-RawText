Four people, among them a woman and her two children, were crushed to death after an explosion caused by a defective heating system razed a five-storey building housing families of the Turkish military here early Monday, officials said.

Eight people were pulled injured from the wreckage of the building in the center of Diyarbakir, the largest city in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast.

Four others remained trapped under the rubble, land forces commander General Ilker Basbug, who flew in from Ankara to inspect the rescue efforts, told reporters.

Two of them were said to have responded to rescuers.

Police detained the man who repaired the heating system on Sunday evening for questioning, the Anatolia news agency reported.

At least two children were among the rescued, Anatolia said. Security officials said none of the injuries were life threatening.

The army set up a security perimeter as dozens of rescuers from civil defense and military teams frantically digged the debris for more survivors and ambulances stood by.

Diyarbakir is home to a major military garrison comprising thousands of troops.

The destroyed building in the city center was part of a complex of two five-storey billets comprising of about a dozen apartments.

Turkey maintains a strong military presence in the southeast, where it has been fighting a Kurdish insurgency for self-rule for the past 22 years.
