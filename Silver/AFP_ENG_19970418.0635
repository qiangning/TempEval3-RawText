Drug traffickers in Malaysia are resorting to new tactics to peddle drugs by hiding them in public places and schools to avoid detection, reports said Saturday.

Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said traffickers were prepared to hide the drugs in public places because they knew it would be difficult for authorities to prove who the drugs belonged to.

"We need the co-opertion of not only the school authorities, but also every member of the public to be more alert and report any dubious activities," The Star newspaper quoted him as saying in the northern state of Perak.

In the past week two large drug caches have been uncovered in public areas.

On Tuesday, Johore police found 5.47 kilograms (12 pounds) of heroin in a men's toilet at a highway interchange. On Thursday, more than 63 kilograms of marijuana was located hidden in the ceiling of a Kuala Lumpur secondary school classroom.

Four people were arrested following the marijuana seizure, and police said they were believed to be members of a syndicate using the school as a storage place in an attempt to avoid detection.

Megat Junid said more such cases would emerge as the authorities stepped up enforcement on illegal drug dealings.

Malaysia has hanged 214 drug traffickers since the introduction of the mandatory death penalty in 1980, while 118 are on death row.

A death sentence is mandatory for anyone caught with 15 grams (0.5 ounce) or more of heroin or morphine in Malaysia.

Malaysia, which describes all proven drug users as addicts, has an estimated 400,000 addicts in a population of 20 million people.

Narcotics officials say the death penalty has to some extent failed to deter drug trafficking because of the huge profits to be gained from trafficking.
