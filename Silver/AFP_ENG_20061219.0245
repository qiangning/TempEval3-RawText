The French agriculture ministry said Tuesday that bird flu is not responsible for the deaths of several thousand chickens on a farm in the east of the country.

"Preliminary results show no sign of an influenza virus in the samples taken from the farm in the Haute-Marne (department)," a statement said.

Vets who examined the 4,000 chickens who died Saturday at a farm in Sarrey said they had been killed by asphyxia.

"It was a problem of atmosphere control. They suffocated to death," said Bernard Brocvielle, Haute-Marne's chief vet.

An emergency plan was set in action on Sunday because of fears the chickens might have been infected with the H5N1 flu virus which can be fatal to humans.
