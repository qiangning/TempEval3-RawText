Dallas Cowboys' temperamental wide receiver Terrell Owens was fined 35,000 dollars Monday by the NFL for spitting in the face of Atlanta's DeAngelo Hall in Saturday's 38-28 win.

The fine by new commissioner Roger Goodell is more than double the 17,000 dollars fine levied by former commissioner Paul Tagliabue against Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor for spitting in the face of Tampa Bay running back Michael Pittman in a playoff game last season.

Taylor was ejected from the game for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Owens spit on Hall after Dallas' sixth play from scrimmage, but it was not seen by the officials.

Earlier in the series, Hall used his forearms to shove Owens. Then after tight end Jason Witten caught a pass, Owens spit on Hall before heading back to the huddle.

"I got frustrated and I apologize for that (spitting)," Owens said. "It was a situation where he (Hall) kept bugging me and getting in my face."

Said Hall, "I lost all respect for the guy. You don't spit in another grown man's face."

Owens later beat Hall for a seven-yard touchdown late in the first quarter and a 51-yard score midway through the second quarter. He has 77 catches for 1,040 yards and 11 touchdowns this season.

Owens played just seven games with the Philadelphia Eagles last season before the club banished him for conduct detrimental to the team. He publicly criticized numerous members of the organization - including star quarterback Donovan McNabb.

Signed to a three-year, 25 million dollar contract in the offseason by the Cowboys, Owens created quite a stir when he was admitted to a Dallas hospital on September 26 for what was classified by police as an "accidental overdose" of prescription painkillers.
