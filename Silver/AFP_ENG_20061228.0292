Ethiopian-backed government troops on Thursday entered northern Mogadishu hours after Islamists abandoned the city they had controlled for six months, the country's premier and residents said.

"We are already inside Mogadishu in some areas," Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi told reporters in Afgoye township, about 20 kilometres (13 miles) west of the capital.

Mogadishu residents in the Suuqaholaha district confirmed the troops had entered into the city from the north, where one said that crowds cheered the government forces he saw accompanied by Ethiopian soldiers.

"I saw government troops in north Mogadishu. They have fully entered the town. People were cheering and shouting that 'Welcome our government'," said Nur Dirie, another resident

"I am telling you that I also saw Ethiopian forces enter, (they) are now in Suuqaholaha. They are eating banana and mangoes and I saw them do that," Dirie added.

"They have come, the Ethiopian troops!" exclaimed Saney Mumin, a resident said.

"I counted 50 Ethiopian armed vehicles. They are now Masnah military camp (in northern Mogadishu)," he added.

"I have seen some government troops who are uniformed enter parts of Suuqaholaha and El-arsid neighbourhood," said Aweys Ibrahim, a resident of northern Mogadishu.

"I never saw Ethiopians, but only government."

Mogadishu residents said the government forces had approached the city from the north, northwest and west, effective surrounding the capital by the land approaches.

In Afgoye, Gedi started talks with elders and other local leaders, amid fears that the Islamists were planning to launch a guerrilla war, an AFP correspondent accompanying him reported.

Gedi, who was carried by an Ethiopian helicopter, said he had no plans to meet Islamic Courts Union officials.

Gedi arrived in this township accompanied by cabinet minister Hussein Aidid and police comissioner Ali Madobe, both former warlords who were routed from Mogadishu by the Islamists in June.

Fighters backing the government took control of the international airport, the sea port and the presidential palace once Islamists had conducted a latest "tactical withdrawal" after Ethiopian troops and aircraft began attacking them on December 20.

Relief workers said the Islamist leadership told them that their gunmen had been forced to split up into clan-based militia similar to those run by the warlords who held Mogadishu until they were routed in June and the Islamic Courts Union's power spread over the south and centre of the country.
