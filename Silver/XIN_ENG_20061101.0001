Two amphibious Russian aircraft have arrived in Indonesia's South Sumatra province to help fight haze-causing fires in the west of the country, a report said Wednesday.

The two BE-200 aircraft, which will be used to douse the land- clearing fires lit on Kalimantan and Sumatra islands, will strengthen the nation's fire-fighting air fleet, which consists of five BO-105 helicopters owned by the Indonesian Air Force, Navy and police, reported major national newspaper The Jakarta Post.

The Indonesian House of Representatives has approved 100 billion rupiah (10.52 million U.S. dollars) to fight the fires, which have caused choking haze to blanket the west of the country, along with Singapore, Malaysia and parts of southern Thailand.

The lease for the aircraft was signed on Oct. 23 by officials from the Russian Emergencies Ministry and the Indonesian National Disasters Coordination Agency (Bakornas).

Kirill Barsky, Russia's deputy chief of mission here, said the country was happy to help Indonesia fight the haze.

Barsky expressed confidence the two aircraft supported by 29 crew would be capable of extinguishing forest fires over large areas.

"We're optimistic about getting the best results because of the experienced crew members," he said.

The planes' crew had fought similar fires in Africa several years ago and had just finished dealing with blazes in Portugal, he said.
