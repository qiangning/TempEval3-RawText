The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)

on Tuesday urged, for the first time, to attack American targets and interests in the Middle East.

The threat came in a statement released by al-Qassam Brigades, a military wing of Hamas, following the death of 19 Palestinians in Israeli artillery shelling in northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun in the day.

"America provides political and logistical cover for the crimes

committed by the Zionist occupation and it must be blamed on Beit Hanoun massacres prior to the occupation," said the statement.

It called on Arab and Muslims to "teach the American enemy unmerciful lessons they will not forget."

In the past, Hamas, which now leads the government, has said that their battle was only with Israel and their borders are inside Israel and the Palestinian territories.

In the meantime, al-Qassam brigades also vowed to respond to the killings in Beit Hanoun.

Wednesday's strikes came after 24 hours of the Israeli withdrawal from the town. Over the past week, more than 63 Palestinians have been killed so far in Israeli incursion in Beit Hanoun.
