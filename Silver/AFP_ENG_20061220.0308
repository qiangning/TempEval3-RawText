The Swedish parliament was on Wednesday set to adopt the centre-right government's plans to raise premiums for unemployment insurance while decreasing payouts to the jobless.

Under existing rules, Sweden's unemployed who previously earned less than 20,075 kronor (2,945 dollars, 2,220 euros) a month, receive eighty percent of their former salary for 300 days, a period which can be extended a further 300 days.

For those whose previously earned more than 20,075 kronor per month, benefits amount to 80 percent of their salary up to a pre-tax ceiling of 16,060 kronor a month for a maximum of 100 days.

This group is also entitled to a pre-tax maximum of 14,960 kronor per month for a further 200 days.

Under the proposed changes all unemployed workers are to receive 80 percent of their salary for 200 days, 70 percent of their salary for the next 100 days and 65 percent for an unlimited period thereafter.

From the 301st day unemployment benefits would be subject to stricter controls, however.

Employees currently contribute on average 100 kronor per month to unemployment insurance.

Under the new legislation their contributions would rise on average by 238 kronor.

If approved on Wednesday, the law will take effect on January 1, although the reduction in payments would take effect in March.
