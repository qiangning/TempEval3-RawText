Turkish security forces arrested 19 members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), including one woman, in four separate operations in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, an official press release said on Thursday.

The press release issued by the Istanbul Police's Anti-Terror Department said an operation was carried out in Istanbul after the police received information on illegal weapon possession and selling.

In cooperation with the Intelligence Department, Anti-Terror units arrested two PKK members charged with illegal marketing of hand guns.

Police officers seized 34 hand guns, 53 cartridges and 150 bullets in homes and offices of the two PKK members.

In a separate operation on Nov. 14, Istanbul police arrested one PKK member with five electrical fuses.

In another operation on Nov. 16, Istanbul police arrested four PKK Members and found two Iraqi made hand guns.

In addition, in an illegal demonstration at Istanbul's Kucukcekmece district, police forces arrested 12 PKK members who carried five Molotov cocktails.

Turkey has been fighting against a resurging violence as the PKK intensified landmine and remote-controlled bombing attacks in the country over the past few months.

At least 200 Turkish soldiers have been reportedly killed in clashes with PKK members this year.

More than 37,000 people have been killed since the rebel group took up arms against the government for an independent Kurdish state in Kurdish-dominated southeastern Turkey in 1984.
