Four children were injured when a suspected Moslem rebel lobbed a grenade at their home in a town north of here, the Philippine military said Wednesday.

The four children, aged three, six, seven and 17, suffered shrapnel wounds in the bodies after an unidentified man aboard a motorcycle threw the grenade at their home in the town of Sirawai late Tuesday, the military report said.

Intelligence sources said the attack was a retaliatory move by rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) who had suffered heavy casualties in last week's fighting between their troops and the military in Sirawai.

"This could be the start of their retaliatory attacks," said a military official who asked not to be named.

Last week's clashes, which left 30 rebels and four soldiers dead, came amid an impasse in ceasefire talks between the two sides, which failed to agree on the disposition of its forces around a rebel camp in the town of Buldon east of here.

The MILF is a splinter of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which last year signed a peace treaty with the government to end a 24-year guerrilla campaign aimed at setting up a separate Moslem state in the country's south.

The MILF, which had refused to join the negotiations, was left out in the political settlement. Manila hopes to forge a similar accord with the MILF to establish development projects in the once war-torn southern Philippines.
